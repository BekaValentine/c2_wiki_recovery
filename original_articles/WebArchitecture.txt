The architecture of the WorldWideWeb is part technical design, but it is also about building convivial places to
live, work and play, in the sense of traditional architecture, e.g. the work of
ChristopherAlexander. 

RoyFielding, in his dissertation http://www.ebuilt.com/fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm, compares HTTP to the architecture of ChristopherAlexander. Just as poetry is created by putting the most meaning into the least words and great architecture by combining the most patterns into the smallest space, Roy shows how HTTP combines the features of so many architectural systems into one.

TedNelson argues in TheFutureOfInformation that "the main concerns in software
development, as well as in movie making, are its effects on the mind and heart of the
viewer."

The technical architecture of the web is based
on naming, formats, and protocols:

	* UniformResourceIdentifier, UniformResourceLocator, http://www.w3.org/Addressing/, http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Naming.html

	* HyperTextMarkupLanguage (HTML), ExtensibleMarkupLanguage (XML), http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Formats.html, ResourceDescriptionFramework (RDF), SemanticWeb (See SemanticWebLayerCake)

	* HyperTextTransferProtocol, http://www.w3.org/Protocols/RelevantProtocols.html

TimBernersLee did the engineering design of the URL/HTML/HTTP
Web in the early '90s
(see technical notes http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/
style issues http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/) but the essential
ideas go back to AsWeMayThink in 1945, DougEngelbart in the 60's,
etc. see nots on web history at http://www.w3.org/History.html
as well as work by TedNelson on HyperText, DaveClark et. al.
on TCP/IP, etc.

WebArchitecture is often obscured by limited implementations.
Perhaps a WebDesignCurriculum could help.
