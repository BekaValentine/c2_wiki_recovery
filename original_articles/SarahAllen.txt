I like to create software that people use, ideally software that people love to use.  

Software Projects:
	* PACo (v1)
	* AfterEffects (v1)
	* ScreenReady (v1)
	* ShockWave (v1/4-8)
	* MacromediaDirector (v6-8)
	* FlashPlayer (v6)
	* FlashCommunicationServer (v1)

I'm not longer at Macromedia.  In a couple of weeks, I'll be starting at LaszloSystems.  In the meantime I am experimenting with wikis and other internet tech on http://www.ultrasaurus.com -- the wikis aren't linked yet because they are *very* experimental and only one will stay.

I would appreciate feedback on the wiki thoughts below by anyone, especially experienced wiki people who might be reading this.

New to wiki. I really just wanted to set up a FAQ, and wiki was suggested as a format. It took me minutes to install UseModWiki, but it is taking me much longer to understand wiki culture and how it could be (should be?) applied.  

Wiki Technical info (kept here as I learn about wiki)
	* the perl wikis seem to be very responsive, PHP and some other languages seem slow
	* I like the ChiqChaq look-and-feel (I must admit to a preference for interCaps, but the international issue is real, not that I expect to be writing in Hebrew or Japanese)
	* a wiki FAQ by TyberiusPrime http://faq.ozoneasylum.com (custom wiki engine)

Wiki Culture info
	* not half as important as the software you'll finally use is the community, and one, two or more people with a dedication -- TyberiusPrime ''This is a subtle point about open source software that I hadn;t thought about: if I find like-minded people, then the software will likely evolve where I want it to go.''
	* WikiUserInterface is confusing for the newbie, but I like the powerful concepts behind collaborative site design, really perfect for a FAQ, but a FAQ must also be very easy to use
	* To start or note start my own wiki.  From FrontPage, "The discussion here is focused on PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in software development, and is an InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas." However, 
different wikis have different purposes, and such rules wouldn't normally be enforced on home pages. Since I have a pretty focused target community, it makes sense to start my own wiki.  But I think a discussion of WikiPatterns or WikiEnginePatterns would be appropriate for this site.

I worked with HarryChesley on ShockWave. I was delighted to find his home page and left him a note, only to discover through later reading that someone else created it for him, so I've moved my note here for now.

''The real world creates a blend of anonymity and identity. You may be anonymous, but you are instantly recognizable if you make yourself noticed. People can change their behavior once they get to know you, whether they know your real name or not.''

Hey Sarah, are you still at Macromedia? -- CurtisBartley ''Nope.  Updated page (above), left note on your page.''
