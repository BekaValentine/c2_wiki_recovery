I rarely check my WikiMail. Use mailto:timc+c2wiki@divide.net instead. But if you're trying to reach me for HP business, then use my @hp.com address, which HP employees can look up in the HP directory.

This is my PortlandPatternRepository WikiWikiWeb home page. I also have a "main" page at WikiPedia that is most generic: 
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Tim_Chambers.
I already have a pretty extensive web at http://alum.mit.edu/www/tbc/, so jump there to get to know me. This audience will probably be better served by starting at my Hacks page ('''http://alum.mit.edu/www/tbc/hacks/'''). (Also see my Web bookmarks at http://alum.mit.edu/www/tbc/bookmrks.htm.)

I heard of WikiWikiWeb in the late summer of '99, but I finally got turned on to contributing a few weeks later thanks to comments made in a discussion at QuickTopic started by KeithDawson (see http://www.quicktopic.com/1/H/emxb7z9ubBnT5eAuc8l). That, in turn, started a discussion specific to the Wiki Wiki Web (see http://www.quicktopic.com/1/H/VFjcqpwI57gfTNQcnWlb). How utterly interconnected we all are! Anyway, that former TIO discussion directed me to WelcomeVisitors, which suggested I add my name to RecentVisitors, and so I now have my own page on the Wiki Wiki Web.

My connection to this Wiki Web? Well, I ''did'' read the DesignPatterns book by the GangOfFour 'way back when...

'''G''''''gSig'''

'''G''''''gSig''' stands for "Google GPG Signature." I use my 64-bit GPG key ID. I wanted something that would be unique in Google searches, anonymous at first blush, and obscure enough to discourage other uses -- that is, not only unique, but hard for others on the planet to remember so they would be discouraged from dropping such a string on a Web page and thus pollute the search results.

I started doing this years ago. Within 24 hours Google started indexing results; for the latest, see http://www.google.com/search?q=1E4AF729D5CEFFD0.

''I would choose to delete this G''''''gSig from this wiki. It's a triumph of a "neat" idea over the end result. Yes, you may be able to find everything you've touched, but it makes pages messy. Consider your convenience over everyone else's annoyance. While such annoyance may be small, multiply it by the number of people who read the page. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, etc., and I think it should go, especially in the light of the preferred wiki mode of not signing contributions.'' -- Anonymous

I'm divided:
* it is a nice experiment and as such there is no need to delete this extra id (for the time being).
* it really is a very slight annoyance (VeryLongWikiNames are much worse). I wouldn't mind if a few WikiZen used it.
* one should respect the wishes of the signer to add whatever he wants.
* one should balance this against 'the preferred wiki mode of not signing contributions'.
-- GunnarZarncke (who has a name that is sufficiently unique to search for it without false positives: http://www.google.com/search?q=gunnar-zarncke)

If only done on this Wiki, I see little value compared to backlinks. However, I think the idea was to do it on ''every'' webpage touched, not just here. Perhaps putting the ID on your wiki HomePage and using BackLink''''''s from that point on would suffice?
--AalbertTorsius (who, like Gunnar, is blessed with sufficiently unique name)

''Right. I'm leaving my G''''''gSig around the Web, but not here.'' -- TimChambers
