My degree from DeVry has served me well.  

After graduating in '86 (EET, 3.8), I began my professional career at AT&T's Bell Labs.  Later I was recruited to GE's Medical Systems in Waukesha, WI, where I was their first Software QA Coordinator.  Early in 1991, I started my own business:  Scan America.  We specialize in Business Process Automation - a specialty whereby we look to automate manual processes using the technologies of Document Imaging, Forms Processing, XML and Web Services.

It's be 16 years since I graduated, but I liked the hands-on approach they have to all subject matter.   I'd had prior schooling at a major university and the contrast in approach to the subject matter is stark. (How many people end up actually writing compilers anyway?)   

Frankly I found the DeVry experience much more appropriate for preparation to work in industry.

Maybe not whole compilers; but "how many people end up writing some kind of parser?" - I'd say a ''lot''.  -- MikeSmith

''Ooh yes, wrote a bunch of parser-like things, until I learned about RegularExpression''''''s, then built parsers with those. -- StijnSanders''

I went there in Phoenix for a CIS degree.  I graduated in 1999, right before they changed from "De''''''Vry Institute of Technology" to "De''''''Vry University" and started advertising themselves as a way to break into the video game industry.  Fortunately, I've been working steadily since 2000.  I had four semesters of CobolLanguage, but that was the class where the teacher insisted our programs not crash when the wrong data was entered into them, and that's the sort of thing that's important when people are paying you to program.  So I consider that time well spent.  --NickBensema
