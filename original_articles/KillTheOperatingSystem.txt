Dynamo from HP would be a good start here.

I'm assuming you're referring to Dynamo's resemblance to an ExoKernel. However, only someone entirely ignorant of OperatingSystemsDesign can think that exokernel implies eliminating operating systems. You can't eliminate operating systems, since all LanguagesAreOperatingSystems.
