[A Renga is a collaborative japanese verse form.  It can be written by any number of poets.  It is written in alternating wakkis ''(Wakki''''''Wakki?)'' (7-7) and hokkus (5-7-5).  Each new set of lines should respond to the previous one, by subtly turning on am image or a word.  Wordplays which shift the meaning of a word in the previous line are highly valued.  The syllabic structure, is, of course, a crude translation.	Are there any literary Japanese speakers who want to enlighten us on renga form in Japanese?]

 ''WikiWikiWeb''
 ''so vast it toggles the head''
 ''so I go to bed''

 Sugarplums dance in my bed
 The mouse ate them then fled off -

 ''dragging a pointer''
 ''on-screen, anticipating''
 ''a double-click''

  Right-click once then twice now thrice
  D*** the machine is frozen

 ''beep beep beep beep beep''
 ''wiki devoured my edits''
 ''really good edits''

 EllenFeiss is mighty nice 
 Sugar, Spice and all things twice!

 Should RenGa rhyme or
 Is that too much distraction
 From the HaiKu-ness?

 Sugar, spice and all twice nice
 D*** I'm getting addicted

 Like moth to a flame
 Moths in circling of candles
 Debate the issues
