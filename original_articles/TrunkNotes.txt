Trunk Notes is a personal wiki for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and is developed by Apps On The Move.

Wiki entries use the MarkDown syntax. Text, image and sound wiki entries can be created. The interface is designed to allow for easy creation and searching of notes.

Dynamic content allow you to implement a highly customized information system. One example is using Trunk Notes as a GTD tool. Write "@phone 12/02/2010 (1) Call Bob about the meeting" on a line in a note concerning an important project. On the page @phone you can generate a list of all relevant actions using {{action @phone}}. Trunk Notes will search the wiki for actions with the @phone context and sort in date and priority order.

Trunk Notes can export the entire wiki as a series of plain text files. The wiki can also be accessed in any web browser by connecting to a web server running on the iPhone or iPod Touch.

Many users have migrated from NoteStudio to Trunk Notes.

* Huh. Sounds a lot like the "Intelligence" system of the AppleNewton, but extendable by the user.
