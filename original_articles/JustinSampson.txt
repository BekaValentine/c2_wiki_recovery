I'm a software engineer by trade, living in San Francisco, CA.

My MyersBriggs type is INTP. I remember testing as INTJ in high school but in my twenties I've consistently tested as INTP. I guess I've mellowed out a bit.

Here are some pages I created documenting a little experiment I did trying to refactor the circularity out of VisitorPattern:

	* IndependentVisitorPattern
	* VisitorPatternRefactoring

Reading the first few books in the XP Series clarified
so many thoughts in my head that I started keeping a
journal of XP-related ideas (Justin's Extreme
Journal). Here are a couple of entries:

	* ConsideringOpenSource (see also CombiningOpenSourceAndXp)
	* TheCodeLooksLikeTheTeam
