Until our spamming friend finds a new plaything, NewRecentChanges (at http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges) will frequently be cluttered with his attempts to annoy us.  In order to reduce the annoyance, I have created an alternative NewRecentChanges at:

http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/wardswiki/   

The format is rather different, as it's been hastily crafted from existing code.  However, the content is the same except the spammed pages do not appear and heavily edited pages show only the first and most recent edits.

The spam pages are automatically removed some time after the spamming slows or stops.

You're welcome!  I thought RecentChangesThatBypassesSpammer is a better name than RecentChangesThatBypassesEditWar, because it isn't an EditWar, at least not in the usual sense.  The pages that ManorainjanHolzapfel is repeatedly re-creating would be considered mainly unwanted drivel even if their author wasn't HardBan''''''ned, so they're effectively spam.  

The absence of any clear motive for creating the pages and the apparent desperation to do so -- along with the time of year: nearly Christmas 2014 -- implies an almost pathological degree of attention-seeking behaviour.  It suggests that Manorainjan is very lonely, perhaps due to (or at least encouraged by) his apparent social awkwardness.  His interaction here, broken as it may be, perhaps serves as a partial substitute for much-needed human contact.  

Of course, WardsWiki isn't a self-help group.  We can only hope that ManorainjanHolzapfel will eventually find help, and perhaps solace, somewhere else and in a positive and constructive fashion, rather than continuing to cause mild but persistent irritation here.  In the mean time, the best thing we can do -- for us, and for him -- is to ignore him.
