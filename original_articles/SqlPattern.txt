Sql-related IdiomOrPattern can help those of us who are using relational database for more than a persistent storage for objects. They are applicable only in StructuredQueryLanguage, which is, however, the only relational language around, so they can be considered patterns. 

Some patterns are:
	*ThinkSqlAsConstraintSatisfaction
	*TemplateTables
	*SliceResultVertically
	*TreeInSql

See also SqlMyopia - hopefully patterns help to cure it ;)
