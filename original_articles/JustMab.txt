Hi, thanks and no I don't mind.
WRT dictionary: sorry about excessive new pages - wasn't sure which ones to include and which not to at that point.

WRT real names - it's a tough call. See what I've written at the end of the PseudonymityWithUntraceability page.

On AustralianAttitudeToAuthority, you put it down to a ConvictMentality.

The question I've got is: what ConvictMentality? Australia stopped being a penal colony in the early 1800's, and two of the original colonies never accepted convicts. Even in the First Fleet, the bulk of the people coming over were free (either free settlers or members of the colonial administration). Believe it or not, very few Australians care about the early days of being a penal colony.

For that matter, the United States was a penal colony of England for a fair while, and had a much higher ratio of indentured and convict settlers to free settlers (that's ignoring the whole slavery issue). Do they have a ConvictMentality?

Sorry for the rant... it's just a button of mine. -- RobertWatkins.

sorry, took me a while to get back to this... I postulated it as a possible theory - not that I can know - I haven't done any definitive studies in the area or anything. I was wildly guessing as to why it could be. Yes, the US had penal colonies also, but I also am aware that a vast amount of US settlers were (what's the word?) pilgrims? -> religious settlers of various sorts... in my absolutely untrained opinion I think this had a prfoundly different effect on the US culture. Also it must be considered that Australia is 200 years old... the US is how many centuries now?

Also, yes I know we don't care so much about the penal settlements (I'm an Aussie). As I said - it was a guess as to a possible theory of why we are so much more resistant to authority. Anyway, I'm surprised anyone really took it that seriously ;) I was hoping simply to inspire a bit of discussion on a topic I had considered as a possibility - just wondering... hopefully I haven't offended anyone :(
