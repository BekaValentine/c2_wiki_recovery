 '''Hello, I'm MrId.'''

 We're all full of flaws - poor Krell, Id's force
 Is caused by their great furnaces of course. 
 That is of course unless the source
 Is monsterous instead! 

 Fly through a space warp to Altair Four 
 With ray guns and force fields for peace, not war 
 You will not see but you can't ignore
 The feet of MrId! 

 Robots yakkity-yak a streak 
 And will not fire a ray, 
 But MrId will never speak 
 Until he has crewmen to slay! 

 You fight force with force, but Krell steel doors 
 Can't keep out your own psychic flaws of course
 You never heard the Freudian laws? 
 Well, listen to this... 

 '''You are MrId!'''
