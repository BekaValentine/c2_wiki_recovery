Eric,

I've read about Fp Wiki on your site. You have to forgive me if this is an ignorant question but is this available to be used free of charge by large corporations.

I work for American Express but I'm not in procurement. I'm making an inquiry because I'm constructing a "pitch" that we migrate to a wiki.
