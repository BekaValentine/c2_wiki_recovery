A while back a coworker told me that the online bookstore FatBrain was starting an electronic publishing service called eMatters.  People can write technical papers, poetry, short stories, books or novels, and publish them electronically.  People download them for a fee and the author gets a cut.  

We ended up having a rollicking discussion about eMatter titles that would get
maximum hits.  Then we just started getting silly.  

	* Implementing Pointer Arithmetic in Java
	* Stupid Template Tricks in C++
	* Enterprise Frameworks in APL
	* Building an Enterprise Daytrading Framework in Java ''(We think this one would get maximum hits)''
	* The Complete Idiot's Guide to the UML Metamodel
	* Algorithm Analysis for Fun and Profit
	* Things your Object Guru Never Told You

I notice that AlistairCockburn has some ProvocativeBookTitles on his page.
