Dave is a programmer living in the suburbs of StPaul, Minnesota.  He hasn't yet had the opportunity to work on a serious OOP or ExtremeProgramming project yet, but he has high hopes.  When ignoring computers, he plays guitar, pets his cats, and lectures his children.  He can be reached at dave@spnz.org.
