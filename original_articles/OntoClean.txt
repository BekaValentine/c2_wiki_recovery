OntoClean (see '''http://www.ontoclean.org/''') provides a definition of metaproperties which help with the construction of OntologyLanguage descriptions of problem domains.

See for example the discussion on SemanticWebDotOrg (previously OntoWorld) at 

* '''http://www.semanticweb.org/wiki/OntoClean''' and

Implementation of the examples from a paper on OntoClean lead to a hierarchy of categories to express the relationships among various types of object. The benefit of OntoClean is to help the developer of an ontology confront difficulties and ambiguities in the concepts and force clear decisions about how to proceed.  See for example the following for implementation of the example. -- JohnFletcher
