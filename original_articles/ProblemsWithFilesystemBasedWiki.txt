I want a FilesystemBasedWiki.
But, looking at the matter seems to show obstacles:

'''Briefly'''
	* A FilesystemBasedWiki is hard
	* Non-availability of CGI scripting on FILE URLs is a big obstacle.
	* a CvsBasedWiki, e.g. one based on a CvsWeb server,  is reasonably easy.

Specifically
	* JavaScript isn't sufficient to do a FilesystemBasedWiki. CGI is not available to FILE: URLs.
	* Java is sufficient to do a FilesystemBasedWiki, modulo security manager issues. But it is questionable as to how ubiquitous Java is.

'''Detail'''

Oh bloody hell!!!!!! 

I typed in a lot more details,
but somebody else had edited the page before me.
My save was not allowed.
I thought that I had copied all the text so that
I could reapply the edits,
but I may have lost it.
Now let's see if I can find out where it is logged...

''My experience has been that hitting my browser's "back" button returns me to the edit page with my most recent edits intact.''

AG: '''A Windows FilesystemBasedWiki is blocked by the  non-availability of a ubiquitous scripting system on Windows.'''

OTHER: I'm pretty sure every current version of Windows comes with VBScript.

AG: You're right. I misdiagnosed: 
CGI scripts don't get run from FILE URLs,
on neither Windows nor standard Unixes.

----

OTHER: Perl works great on Windows, and most Web hosting services have Perl on their Windows servers.

AG: again, I am trying to create a non Web-based wiki, as I try to describe
in FilesystemBasedWiiki. Not a Web-based wiki that just happens to store text in files.

Grrr.... just had two edit collisions. Shows how Zwiki's comment-mode is a good idea.
