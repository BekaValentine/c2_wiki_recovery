"First person shooter" computer game by Valve Software (http://www.valvesoftware.com).  

Pretty much won every "game of the year" type award for 1998...

Designed using the CabalDesignProcess.

Uses a heavily modified version of the original Quake engine (from IdSoftware). It is one of the first person shooters to have a real and interesting story line. ''One of the first, perhaps, but beaten by about 4 years by a creature named Marathon, with literally hundreds of pages of text in its story.  Too bad it was only for macs, eh? (though I guess now it's out for everything at http://source.bungie.org ) -- DanUznanski'' It's also good fun in deathmatch networked play.
