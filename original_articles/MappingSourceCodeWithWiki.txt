I'm trying to formulate a plan for mapping project source code with WikiWiki.  I'm wondering if there are people out there who have done that.  Ideally, the map could translate into both visual UML models and flattened into source code for the compiler.  Anybody have any ideas or has it been done? --KirkKitchen

You can find an example of LiterateProgramming (a non-XP method) in WikiBase.
Source code starts at http://c2.com/cgi/wikibase?WikiInHyperPerl
	* Wrapped text in proportional font are "comments."
	* Fixed-width font text (with a leading spaces) is executable Perl code.
Graphics would, of course, be a bit more of a challenge.  ;->
