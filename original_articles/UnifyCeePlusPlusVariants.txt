As of 2003-09-03, there are 58 WikiPage''''''s with "Cpp" in the title, 10 with "Cplusplus", 22 with "Cplus''''''Plus", and 21 with "Cee''''''Plus''''''Plus", all apparently related to the MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage C++ (also known as CeePlusPlus or even CeePlusPlusLanguage on this wiki). In the long run, it may be helpful to standardize on a spelling on this wiki. (Is it ModernCeePlusPlusDesign or Modern''''''Cpp''''''Design?)

This is certainly not an urgent need, but still. Note that the name of this page should not be considered as leaning towards "Cee''''''Plus''''''Plus" - it's shorthand for the near-unreadable "Unify''''''Cee''''''Plus''''''Plus''''''Cpp''''''Cplus''''''Plus''''''And''''''Cplusplus".

 Mostly Cpp              3   (CeePlusPlus where Cpp is not practical)
(someone at 68.155.107.249 decremented the count for Cpp on September 3, 2003. Could you explain why????? Changing your mind is OK; cheating is not. ;) ''I changed my mind after considering the WikiAlphabet'')

'''Cpp Pros'''
* Often the extension of a C++ source file.
* It has an established Category.
* The shortest and therefore the SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork. 
* Will give a meaningful result for LikePages.
'''Cpp Cons'''
* Also a shorthand for the CeePreprocessor, therefore sometimes ambiguous.
* Cannot be a WikiName of its own, though we could have Cpp''''''Language.
* Cpp is UgLy.

'''CplusPlus Pros'''
* No confusion with CeePreProcessor shorthand.
* Easier for a newbie to look for on FindPages.
'''CplusPlusCons'''
* CplusPlus is UgLy. ''Especially since the '''same''' word is in both lowercase and uppercase''

'''CeePlusPlus Pros'''
* Consistent with CeeLanguage and CeeSharp.
'''CeePlusPlus Cons'''
* It feels a bit kludgy to spell a letter for a valid WikiWord, however, WikiAlphabet is common practice.

'''Cplusplus Pros'''
* Only "C" is capitalized, giving it a similar feel to "C++".
'''CplusplusCons'''
* Not a WikiName on its own.

On a practical note, the category CategoryCpp already collects a lot of pages about C++, many of which do not contain any variant in the page name. So one way to sort this out is in fact to include all pages about C++ in the category. Also please note that there is a category Category''''''Cpp''''''Templates as well. -- JohnFletcher.
