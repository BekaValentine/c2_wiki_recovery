''Somewhere around here we made an attempt to define "persistence", but I don't remember where. I suspect that how it's defined will be paramount to defining "persistence mechanism". If I remember correctly, I tentatively concluded that '''persistence is relative''', which probably won't surprise anybody who's been around here a while, even if it still pisses them off when I take such alleged "outs". But there is a kind of layering in much of software that thinks in terms of local variables, module/class variables, global variables, and "super" global variables such as databases.''

''Somebody also defined it as "something that's still there even after you trip over the power cord." However, that limits it, or at least frames it in terms of current technology. Maybe the shape of our existing technology is blinding us to more general views or alternatives to the concept of "persistence". Our tools perhaps make a sharp distinction between persistent and non-persistent because they have been shaped by the ram/disk hardware dichotomy for several decades (if you include tape, drums, cards, etc.). --top''
