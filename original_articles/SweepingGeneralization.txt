One of the FallaciousArgument''''''s, also known as ArgumentByTheMasses. Generally qualifies as BS.

This argument says, "Oh, all X is no good at all," or other statements to that effect, without ever offering any ''proof'' that X is no good or even any deductive reasoning why X is no good. This may be an AmericanCulturalAssumption, but probably not. People will "argue" like this in any culture, in any time period.
