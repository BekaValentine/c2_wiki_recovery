'''1.1. Luminosity Functions'''

Below figure shows the luminosity functions for SDSS g-,r-, and i-bands of model galaxies along with Bell et al's at z=0.
* ''Blue'' lines : Bell et al's luminosity functions 
* ''Red'' dotted lines : dust-extinction included (i.e., not corrected for dust-extinction) luminosity functions of model galaxies
* ''Green'' dotted lines : dust-extinction extinction corrected luminosity functions of model galaxies

'''1.2. Color-Magnitude Diagrams'''

Below is (g-r) vs. r CMDs at z=0, 0.5, and 1.0.

In this figure, only central galaxies are included (i.e., satellites are excluded from the sample).

Further below is the link of figure 1. in kimm et al. paper (astro-ph/arXiv:0810.2794).

Before comparison of these figures, first, let me clarify several factors making the figures (look) different.

  1. Kimm et al's CMDs are at z=0.1 while my CMD is at z=0.0.
  2. Kimm et al's x-axis is M_r - 5*log(h) while x-axis in my figure is M_r.
  3. Orientation of x-axis is opposite with different range - Kimm et al's x-axis spans from -18 to -23 while mine spans from -25 to -15.
     So, they are like mirror-images.

The major difference between my CMD and Kimm et al's CMD (figure 1-(b) is fiducial model) is the relative dearth of ''red-sequence'' galaxies in my figure.

The only change I made in the parameter file is the 'dust recipe' (from Charlot-Fall to Calzetti), but, I don't think this can affect ''red'' galaxies' color.

Are the values of model parameters in Kimm et al's fiducial model same with the ones in the default parameter file ?
