http://www.tkoweb.com/final/index.php?p=pplans.htm -- Too bad to see that some users have a bad experience with these companies. We host from only $3.00/month but actually do support you! CustomerService is key.

http://www.iniquinet.com -- Python Web Hosting from $5/month! PHP, Perl, CGI, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Zope, Java/JSP and more!

Anyone have any positive or negative things they'd care to share about companies doing web-hosting for you?

I'm currently using escape.com. It's ok. They want $16/month for 100MB, unlimited pop accounts, unlimited transfers. Support is very poor though and the server goes down probably a handful of times per week for maybe 10 minutes at a time. I'm thinking of switching to cedant.com's standard account which is $13/month of 100MB with 25 pop accounts and 5000MB/month transfer max. It looks (from their website) like they have their act together a little more, but I have no direct experience. I tried looking at reviews on www.worldwidewait.com and cnet but it's pretty hopeless trying to wade through stuff that may or may not be propaganda. -- AndyPierce

Update: for the last two years I've been using cedant.com and have been very happy. Service and reliability have been excellent for me. -- AndyPierce

More Update:  cedant.com was good, until they were bought-out.  The new owners were terrible.  For the last few years (2004+) I've been using Dreamhost.com and am very happy with them.  Good deal, very responsive to complaints, doesn't get in your way.  --AndyPierce

Non-US hosting services are usually cheaper because the admin wages there are lower. However, I feel kind of guilty proposing this because all kinds of tech jobs are leaving the US, leaving a lot of US techies unemployed.

If you're an experienced UNIX user and administrator, you might like csoft: http://csoft.net I use them to host my web and I like their "do it yourself" approach. -- ZeljkoVrba

Virtual hosting has gotten quiet cheap.  You have a virtual machine, typically with root access, and a guaranteed timeslice on the physical host, with more available when the host is lightly loaded.  Performance, reliability, cost, vary from provider to provider, but you can get good results much cheaper than paying for an entire system.  Particularly useful when you don't want to spend a lot of money but want something beyond the standard packages that shared hosting provides.  Typically, those packages are a few releases behind the current for programs like Perl or MySQL.  If you want to run something unusual like Common Lisp or Smalltalk, you will probably need your own machine, and this is the cheapest way to do that.
