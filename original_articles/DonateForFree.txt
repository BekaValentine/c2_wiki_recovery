Give to charity by simply clicking on a link!  This is not a hoax!

This is for a major UK childrens (NSPCC) charity and is backed by big name sponsors such as Microsoft (who actually do the paying).

Basically it is EU residents only, and you may click once per day.  Each time these criteria are met the sponsor donates cash.  Put a link in your favorites or desktop, and visit each day.

Anyway, rather than clicking every day, you could put
something like this in a cron job:
   lynx -source http://www.nspcc.org.uk/donate-4-free/donate-mainhome.asp > /dev/null
