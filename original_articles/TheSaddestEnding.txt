Quite a few qualities of sadness on your list, as well. Some tear-jerkers, some O Henry-esque surprises.

When I saw AiTheMovie on this list, my first thought was that it should be on a page called TheBaddestEnding, with ''bad'' meaning ''not good'', and ''baddest'' chosen because it rhymed with ''saddest''. But now that page has been transmogrified into one where ''bad'' means ''good'', so I think AiTheMovie is an example of TheWorstEnding a movie can have.

I thought that AI is probably the best current example of why films should ''not'' be shown to ''''''Focus Groups'''''' before the final editing phase. It seemes pretty clear (to me at least) that the intended ending was about 10 minutes before the actual ending (I'm trying to avoid spoiliers here, but if you have seen the film I'm sure you know which point I mean here). -- IanPhillips
