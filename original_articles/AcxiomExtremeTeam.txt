Our Acxiom team (http://www.acxiom.com) has been implementing ExtremeProgramming techniques for the past two and a half years. The team has built a large and complex campaign management application for our client's data warehouses. We developed the application using Forte (http://www.forte.com), a distributed Object Oriented development tool. 

We feel our team has put together a very successful process for developing software. At the start of the project, we did not use ExtremeProgramming. From the time we implemented this methodology, we have made great strides in improving the productivity and development of our team members as well as the quality of the application. I wrote an article about our team's experiences developing the application using ExtremeProgramming.

Hi Jim, glad to hear you're having good success. How about posting which of the XP practices your team does and does not follow?

Thanks and continued success! -- RonJeffries
