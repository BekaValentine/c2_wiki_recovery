Dave Beer is a kiwi (New Zealander) living in England/Britain/United Kingdom. (Still not sure which.)

I've totally fallen in love with this Wiki idea. But I am not having any luck introducing it to my workplace. (I like the idea of everyone being able to edit content... it's not as if there isn't a good enough AuditTrail either!)

I'll keep persevering though.

'''Update''' - Well, after a little effort, I managed to get a nice Wiki installed at work. (I work for a large food/beverage company who all almost exclusively Pro-MicroSoft.) Linux wasn't an option (against corporate policy), so I opted for FlexWiki. So far only my team (Web Application Development) and the Security Team use it in anger. ''(Instead of "anger", did you mean "earnest"?)'' ''(No, I meant "anger". It's a nice turn of phrase which means 'to use for real' -- DaveBeer'') But it beats the pants off our CMS tool when it comes to pure simplicity (you can imagine which vendor we purchased our CMS from).
