The WikicWeb is a CeeLanguage version of WikiWikiWeb.  I recoded the entire program in C because that is the language I am most familiar with.  The WikicWeb was designed for the Patterns Home Page at http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/ (BrokenLink 20070524) to create a place where people can tell stories about patterns (The official name is currently the Pattern Stories Web).

I love the idea of having a public Web site where everyone can get involved in editing.  However, the first time I was introduced to the WikiWikiWeb here, there were a few features that seemed confusing or restricting.  It was my goal to eliminate as many restrictions as possible.  This may create a problem since some people will want to be a little too creative and make their pages look a lot different from a normal page.  I assume people can exercise self control in this regard.

Some of the key differences are:
	*HTML tags may appear anywhere ;)
	*Line wrapping never hurts, such as in lists and tags
	*New link tag so you can have complete freedom in the name of the page.  No more HardToReadThis stuff.
	*Lists are intelligent....
	*External links are encapsulated around a name
	*Tabs are automatically converted to 5 spaces.  No longer have to explain what "ConvertSpacesToTabs" means, which may be confusing to newcomers.
	*The backup file will contain an infinite number of backups.

Eric graduated, and nobody was maintaining it, so we moved the content to WikiWorks under as http://wiki.cs.uiuc.edu/patternStories (BrokenLink 20070524). I'm not even sure where the source is. -- RalphJohnson

I really would like to know where to find WikicWeb. Can you tell us more? Or at least give a link?
