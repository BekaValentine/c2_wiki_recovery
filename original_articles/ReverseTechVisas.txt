Countries that flood the US with tech visa workers should allow reciprical visas to their country. It may especially be useful for college graduates who cannot find tech jobs in the US due to lack of experience and who don't yet have family ties. There may be more opportunities overseas for them because the lower wages makes them more cost-competative.

''Many of them probably do; consult your local embassy or consulate for more information.  Working overseas may be a pleasant experience for some people.''

''Somehow, I don't see TopMind moving to Bangalore anytime soon. :)''

''Is that because they figured out your RealName, and are blacklisting you due to your anti-OO heresies? :)  I seem to recall you fretting about such a circumstance in the past...''
