The NorthCarolinaTriangleArea is the conglomeration of the cities of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill in the piedmont of North Carolina. It is home to three large state colleges: NC State, UNC, and Duke. Each has a computer science department, each of which is of course involved in some sort of research.

WardCunningham suggested I keep tabs on this local research in order to further my own education. Here's what I've found so far. --  NathanielTalbott

Don't let NC State's small list fool you; there's a lot of research going on there.  When all of the DenialOfService attacks were going on a few years back, an NC State professor made national headlines because he'd developed a system to detect DoS attacks.  Also, earlier this year (2001), two State professors unveiled an AI system that could automatically write children's stories.  The national media, including Newsweek, picked up on it because it was pointed out that the same system could be used to replace journalists.  I also know that a lot of work on computer aided education has gone on there.  Often, NC State will try to involve researches from multiple disciplines.  For example, one project brought in researchers from the computer science department, the education department, and the School of Design. -- EddieDeyo
