A new game for WikiGnome''''''s. To play, find a well-known wiki page and prepend http://web.archive.org/web/*/ to the URL. Then, try and refactor the page until it resembles the oldest version on record in terms of clarity and simplicity. If there's information that can't be moved out, try and approximate the style of the early WikiWikiWeb.
