When you click on "Cached Snapshot of Page", you are offered a snapshot of the page the last time Google crawled the site. It is another of the ways of recovery of pages which have been deleted or vandalized. It is only one of the ways to RecoverPages.

At the top of the Cached page:

This is G o o g l e's cache of http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors
G o o g l e's cache is the snapshot that we took of the page as we crawled the web.
The page may have changed since that time. Click here for the current page without highlighting.
This cached page may reference images which are no longer available. Click here for the cached text only.
To link to or bookmark this page, use the following url: 

http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=navclient-menuext&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=cache:http%3A%2F%2Fc2.com%2Fcgi%2Fwiki%3FWelcomeVisitors

As noted in GoogleCache, you can get the same result by using '''cache:url''' in the normal Google search box, where "url" is any site of interest.
