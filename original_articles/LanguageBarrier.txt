Wiki has a LanguageBarrier, in that even though EnglishPlease is the chosen language, there are still many misinterpretations of meanings and understandings, as the English used in the USA is AmericanEnglish, that can differ in more ways then one might at first think.  Often meanings do not directly interpret, and some languages (including AmericanEnglish) do not have words to describe certain things and/or meanings.  This causes more problems on this Wiki then perhaps many realize.
