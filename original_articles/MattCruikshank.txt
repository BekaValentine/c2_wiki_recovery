I'm a Software Engineer at Vital Images, Inc. in Minnetonka, Minnesota with a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Michigan State University.  I've been programming since 1981, when I was 8 - my first program was in BASIC on a TRS-80, and it printed prime numbers.
