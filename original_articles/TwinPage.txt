This is a practical, self-describing example of a TwinPage.

If page A is a twin to page B, then it should go without saying that B is a twin to A.
Some wikis support a TechnologySolution of "Twinning" wiki pages. Most of them don't, so it's up to the users to create TwinPages.

Unfortunately, not all wikis allow information hiding like the convention in usemod-type wikis, e.g., http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TwinPage on MeatBall.
Fortunately, WardsWiki at least allows information hiding by iconising the link. (or does it?)

Please add user-defined links to other wikis, containing the same name TwinPage to realize at least a
WabiSabi form of "twinning" wiki pages ;-).
 
Thank you. -- FridemarPache

''An equivalent concept on WardsWiki is the SisterSite. However, this is set up by the server admin, and applies to all pages with the same names between the two sites.''

Actually it is a misnomer. Metaphorically spoken: SisterSites cannot have TwinPages (aka twins) in common; at best they could be related by TwinWikis. As suggestion for a more stringent name for the involved wikis, the term TwinWiki is used. A Website can have many wikis, some wikis with and some wikis without being a TwinWiki to some internal or external site. With this suggested name, we could discriminate user defined TwinWikis from provider defined TwinWikis -- FridemarPache

'''Notice:'''
TwinPage is a misnomer like SisterSite.
In the newer formulation a TwinPage is a "Namesake PartnerPage". ''This is a horrible name, that is better expressed with
the pseudo-icon "<=>".

Or in tradition with Mathematical terminology, we could replace the name TwinPage by StrongPartnerPage.

Instead of struggling for better and better terms, we propose to use language independent pseudo-icons "<->", "<=>".
As soon as the wiki communities use these nearly self-explaining pseudo-icons, there is no need for further efforts to find adequate names (in different languages).
The more pages there are, the more you get the feeling for the usefulness of this simple device (''I hope'').
