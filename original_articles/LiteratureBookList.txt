''While there are some good books here, I don't think anyone is going to come to this list to find something to read.  Better to recommend something in context, than merely list a bunch of books.  As this page is therefore pretty useless, I propose it is a DeletionCandidate.  If not, PleaseMoveThisToTheAdjunct.''
