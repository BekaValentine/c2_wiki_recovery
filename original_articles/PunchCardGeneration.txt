The PunchCardGeneration are people who remember submitting a program on a deck of punched cards. I did that when I went to work in 1969. I still have a small number of blank cards in my desk drawer and show them to the current generation of students, who don't know what they are. They have not seen a SlideRule either. -- JohnFletcher
