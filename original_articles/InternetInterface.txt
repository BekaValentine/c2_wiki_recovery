''Any choices for an Internet language?'' [A what?]

The WWW is a horrible bastardization that set UI technology back 30 years, so no (see ThinClientHasFailed).  But if I had to pick a favorite, it'd be Python.  I usually end up using PHP though, just because that's what every server supports.

''Perhaps but at the end of the day maybe the equation chosen was the best choice:''

* HTML 
* Hyperlinks
* Being able to access any page from a keyword 
* All the information needed on a page. 

Oh, I think the Internet interface was a great choice ''for its original purpose''.  But you don't need a specialized "Internet language" (other than HTML) to disseminate documents and link them together.  Unfortunately, every useful technology eventually outgrows its niche, and so now the net is being used as a generic user interface to all sorts of products: e-commerce, searchable databases, Intranets, fileshares, fanfiction sites, Wikis, etc.

As a generic UI, it sucks.  It takes us back to the days of old modal form-fill-in terminals.  Contrary to the original "web" intent, most uses today are highly linearized, forcing a certain sequence of tasks on the user.  Even then, they're ridiculously hard to program for, because HTTP is a stateless protocol.

There's no support for direct manipulation in the Web, and adding it over HTTP would be a huge burden.  User feedback is slow at best, and non-existent at worst: you can only adapt to user input with a server roundtrip, barring JavaScript and its associated compatibility pitfalls.  There's not even a decent set of UI widgets!  You're limited to HTML forms unless you go the JavaScript route with all its attendant difficulties.  -- JonathanTang
