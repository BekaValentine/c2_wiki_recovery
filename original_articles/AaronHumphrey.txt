Programmer for Kakari Systems Ltd. in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

The current project is written in Visual Basic 6, and in a very non-object-oriented fashion; I am just now starting to get into that.  Our next version is to be in Java. I've been reading the RefactoringBook and it's inspired me to try to use those techniques in VisualBasic, which is why I wandered into the wiki.

I also read a lot of books, mostly SpeculativeFiction, and listen to a lot of music, and have two children and hence not a lot of spare time.

I have a frequently-updated blog called The Den of Ubiquity at http://azpiazu.blogspot.com/, and a like-named home page at http://www.telusplanet.net/public/alfvaen/ which is much less frequently updated.

I am an INTP.
