1752-07-07 marked the birthday of Joseph-Marie Jacquard, in Lyon, France. It is the late 18th century that can be marked as a significant beginning point in the HistoryOfComputing, for it was then that Jacquard developed a practical automatic loom which wove patterns utilizing a linked sequence of PunchedCards. It was from this beginning that Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith developed their own use of cards. Jacquard looms are still found in use today throughout the world. Jacquard died 1834-08-07, in Ouillins, France.
