We talked about TriangleXpFestOne - held June 2 - about Test Driven Development, about testing GUIs, about mis-uses of terms like "refactoring" by groups without any unit tests, about organizations that blame XP for failures when they aren't even doing XP.

We also discussed moving the meeting to another more central location --AlexChapman

I think that since a lot of people in this area work in RTP, or live in Cary, or both, the ideal location would be somewhere in between. Jeff mentioned the possibility of hosting it where he works, in the vicinity of the Factory Outlet shops off of Airport Blvd -- I think that would be about as close to ideal as we're gonna get. --AlanHensel
