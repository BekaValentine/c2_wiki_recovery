This book simply begs for implementation, and not only for buildings. It describes an alternative for master plans; in this case, for the University of Oregon. 

The six principles that Alexander describes offer an alternative for master plans in software development. 

The principles:
	*PrincipleOfOrganicOrder
	*PrincipleOfParticipation
	*PiecemealGrowth
	*PrincipleOfPatterns
	*PrincipleOfDiagnosis
	*PrincipleOfCoordination

A must read! -- MartineDevos

Unfortunately, it isn't really the case study of the ideas from TheTimelessWayOfBuilding that I expected, but instead more of a guide for how to implement some of them. It is however a really good complement to TWOB, since it gives some practical context. I just wish someone would make a follow-up about how the experiment turned out. -- AndersBengtsson

The book is a classic mission statement from the beginning of a social experiment. Some articles on the current state of the experiment, written in 1991 & 1994, can be reached from here:
