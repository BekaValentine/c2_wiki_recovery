I somehow expected, that this page would exist and explain, for example, what happend to this wiki between about 2004/04/21 9:00 and 2004/04/22 3:30 (MEZ)?

''There is WikiWikiSystemNotice, but basically the wiki simply "is", and we tolerate the very occasional downtime. Why should someone who is offering this service for free take valuable time to explain things like that? What would you do with the information?''

I think it was probably a badly way of asking "Why is RecentChanges for yesterday apparently missing so many entries?"

''Maybe someone edited it by hand.''
