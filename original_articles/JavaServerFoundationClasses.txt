JSFC (http://jsfc.sourceforge.net/) is a set of foundation classes for Java used for server side programming of Web forms. JSFC borrows ideas and idioms from familiar GUI toolkits so you can focus on WebApplicationDesign instead of writing form processing routines.

JSFC provides an API that allows developers to assemble HTML form-based applications similar to how they would a traditional GUI client. The JSFC API also provides an event model that abstracts form control processing.

JSFC is a work in progress in its early stages. Current status, code releases, news, CVS sources, and other information is available from the SourceForge Project Info Page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsfc/). Anyone is welcome to lend a hand, send a patch, etc.. You're also welcome to wait for the project to attain critical mass. You can follow our progress by subscribing to jsfc-announce (http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/jsfc-announce/) or monitoring the JSFC module.
