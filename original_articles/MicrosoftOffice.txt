MicrosoftWay does not prevail all the time. Sep05 there were reports that US Mass state plan to phase out MicrosoftOffice in favor of OasisOrganization endorsed alternative. See http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/09/01/HNusmsoffice_1.html

''Because most of Massachusetts' government agencies are using these suites that support proprietary document formats, the "magnitude of the new migration effort to this new open standard is considerable," according to the commonwealth. It expects its agencies to develop phased migration plans with a target implementation date of Jan. 1, 2007.''
 (Did this happen? it is now January 2008)

Microsoft and OASIS:
* Microsoft Office does not natively support OpenDocument. Microsoft has created the Open XML translator project to allow the conversion of documents between Office Open XML and OpenDocument. As a result of this project Microsoft finances the ODF add-in for Word project on SourceForge. This project is an effort by several of Microsoft's partners to create a plugin for MicrosoftOffice that will be freely available under a BSD license. The project has released version 1.0 for MicrosoftWord of this software in early 2007 and plans versions later in 2007 for MicrosoftExcel and Microsoft PowerPoint. Sun Microsystems has also created a OpenDocument plugin for MicrosoftOffice 2000, XP, and 2003 that supports Word, Excel, and Powerpoint documents.
