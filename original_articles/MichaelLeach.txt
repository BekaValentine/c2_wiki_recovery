Hello! I live in Portland, Oregon USA and have had an increasing interest in XP and Agile since 1999. I worked with WardCunningham to form a software company dedicated to open source portal infrastructure and agile web development.

My company, CubicCompass Software, develops and manages CRM oriented portal solutions built on the MicrosoftDotNet platform.

JimShore was employee #1 at CubicCompass where he developed NunitAsp and helped establish many development and testing principles.

I'm a member of the PortlandXpUsersGroup where I try to present about once a year (see PortlandXpUsersGroupNotes). This is a fantastic group that shares in a wide range of experiences and backgrounds. Please contact me (see below) if you're interested in sponsoring XPDX events.

Every other year, or so, I like to take some time off to compose and produce Electronic Jazz music. I spend a lot of time in the Summer exploring the many Oregon Forests, Rivers, and Pacific Coast Trails.

Michael, thanks for the marvelous quote by Simonyi on SoftwareIsArt!
Magical!  --AlainPicard

''I agree. Software really is a science, art, craft, and trade all in one. Simonyi's quote does a great job of capturing this. This perspective alone justifies its own SoftwareIsScienceArtCraftAndTrade page. -Mike''
