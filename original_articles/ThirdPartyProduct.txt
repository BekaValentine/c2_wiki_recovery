ThirdPartyProduct - A purchasable solution developed and sold by another person or organization. Usually a competitor to InHouse developed solutions.

Some people love them, believing that a ThirdPartyProduct will relieve them of the burden of an internal support organization, whilst others hate them, believing that ThirdPartyProduct''''''s will remove competitive advantage that can be gained from using a bespoke solution.

But consider whether an organization should develop a Payroll system or just purchase one of the many that are available; or whether we should develop word processors or spreadsheet packages when there are some obvious candidates available to purchase.
