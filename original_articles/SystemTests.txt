Synonym for AcceptanceTest''''''s.

I disagree with that definition. System tests comprise (but are not limited to)

	* performance tests
	* robustness tests
	* security tests
	* failover tests
	* ...

Feel free to disagree with me, but if one should use the somewhat fuzzy term SystemTests at
all, it means something quite different from AcceptanceTest''''''s. -- JonasLindstrom
