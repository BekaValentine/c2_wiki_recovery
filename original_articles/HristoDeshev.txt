Born and living in Bulgaria.

	* I am JustaProgrammer.  
	* Relatively new to the IT industry - I started working as a programmer in 2000.  Graduated from university in December 2002. 
	* Somewhat biased towards ExtremeProgramming and Agile methodologies in general.

I started getting into ExtremeProgramming just before I graduated.  I've been doing some of code'n'fix before that.  Tried to delve into the SystemArchitect mindset and did not like it at all.  I started looking at ExtremeProgramming as a way to make the software development a more disciplined, predictable, and enjoyable experience.  My initial focus was on TestDrivenDevelopment, Refactoring and defect rate improvements.  I think my view on the software development process has changed significantly thanks to the XpMailingList

I am a part of the effort of creating a Bulgarian ExtremeProgramming user group.  The group has a mailing list set up at yahoo groups - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xp-bulgaria/.
