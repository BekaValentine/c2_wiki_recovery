Over the years of using Wiki, my philosophy has oh so slowly changed from
	1. trying to figure out the right way to do things, to
	2. collecting what works

"Wiki pages should be short", sounds, to me, like a search for rightness and correctness.  "Make wiki pages short" or "short wiki pages" sounds, to me, like a useful technique that can be used (or not) when it makes sense.
