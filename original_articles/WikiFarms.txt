To help Wiki grow, the primary goal of this page should be to help people find good places to host their new wiki idea. Please insert detailed good/bad experiences with the servers, but not into this page, but instead follow the link to the Wiki-page of the individual farm and insert there!

There are already Wikis of many shapes, sizes, colors, and topics. If you are looking to start a wiki, snoop around on the PublicWikiForums (a list of existing wikis), since a suitable wiki may already exist.  Compare wikis at http://www.wikimatrix.org

'''Seeking WikiForums'''

I'm looking for a Wiki using C# that has SSL security to add to a help system I'm developing. This is for a business (a small business but we are willing to pay fair market for the wiki). Please advise about enterprise wikis with admin features, security, easy backups, clear instructions. Thanks!!

Hint: over a thousand (?) wiki are listed at WikiIndex ( http://WikiIndex.com/ ).

(Note: I just added wiki I remembered off the top of my head. There's probably other, better wiki in each of these categories. I hope my pointers to a "nearby" wiki, in connection with the WikiNode system, will get you to the wiki you want. -- DavidCary)
