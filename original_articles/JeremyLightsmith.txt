Currently I'm on sabbatical in South America.  Struggling with Spanish, slow bandwidth, and salsa.  It's not a bad life...

Back in the real world, I work for ThoughtWorks as an agile coach.

I'm interested in how people learn.  Using testing to hold together all the parties involved in development (customers, analysts, developers, testers, pms).  I'm playing with FIT (http://fit.c2.com).

Big on opensource, I am a committer on :
	* nfit (http://sf.net/projects/nfit/) - SteveFreeman and I founded this as a branch of Ward's code and a playpen, it's got some cool features like excel support
	* marathon (http://marathonman.sf.net/) - CharlesLowell and I founded this - these days I'm doing too much .net stuff to be of much use to these guys :)
	* marathon.net (http://sf.net/projects/marathonnet/)
	* selfesteem (http://selfesteem.sf.net/)
	* cruise control.net (http://sf.net/projects/ccnet/)
	* transparent (http://sf.net/projects/transparent/) - I started this, but don't do to much these days
