I found myself wishing that I had a PDA (aka HandHeld) for the first time today just so I could jot down some notes (it's probably telling that I didn't wish for a pen and paper). I started thinking about the process of taking notes on a PDA, and thought it would be great to have a PersonalWiki available on a PDA. Perhaps it would also be useful to replicate the Wiki to my desktop machine or among PDAs.

* I am running EmacsWikiMode on my Pocket PC and I am very satisfied with it as WikiAsPim. You can find more info here: http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/Emacs_and_EmacsWikiMode_on_PDAs

* This may work if you are willing to plug the parts together (if so, write about it here please): If you can run a CGI-capable http server and Python.org or Perl, then try one of the small Python or Perl wikis. I am using thttpd and Diamond Wiki http://www.kimbly.com/cgi-bin/diamond on my Zaurus with acceptable performance, though I have few pages as yet... (Python for PocketPC: http://python.org/download/download_windows.html, 

* You should have a look a look at the WikiLikeThing page, because maybe one of these suits your needs and some will probably be lean enough to run an a PDA.

* And there are JavaVMs which may run one of the Java Wikis for you. A JavaVM for many platform:

There is a "toy" described somewhere that is integrated with notepad. I'd be interested in collaborating on a real program with synchronization, if several people were seriously interested in making a commercial product. -- JohnStoshMuczynski

''That's all well and good if you've got a PalmOs machine. (I used to have one, but found I couldn't get used to not having a keyboard.) Does anyone know of such a thing for Psion/EPOC/Symbian? My Series 5mx can run Java apps, so if there's a non-servlet-based Wiki for Java, that might do the trick.'' -- MikeSmith

Perhaps one of the Java Wikis will run on the SharpZaurus PDA? - BillZimmerly

I'm working on a pocket pc wiki sitting on top of PocketASP (http://www.modezero.net/pocketasp/overview.htm)from ModeZero. It's a bit of a back burner project so I do bits and pieces when I can. Has a Pocket Access Db for page content and uses ASP for delivery of content and editing of pages.

''a PalmOs machine ... I couldn't get used to not having a keyboard.''

Me either. That's why I got an AlphaSmartDana (PalmOS, nice keyboard, http://alphasmart.com/ ). Real Soon Now I intend to see if these PalmOS software "work well" with it. (Sure, they'll *run* the same as on any other PDA - tapping with the stylus - but will they also let me use the keyboard, as recommended by PointerAndKeyboard ?). -- DavidCary

I have been finding NoteStudio to be a user-friendly Windows PC/Palm personal Wiki.

'''WikiOnPda QuickQuestions''' -- posted before Sep04

'''Q''' Anyone got a ''usable'' WikiOnPda and with these conditions
* have more than 500 pages of information 
* can use Ward's text formatting rules?
* have working link to internet (reasonable browser) from within the Wiki?
* And affordable too?

I am waiting for the above factors to converge before I buy a PDA.

''It may be that these operations won't commute. Why not buy a PDA and write the software you want? Then sell it and recoup your investment.''
