I'm linking this Wiki from my website front page. I've lost more hours wandering the pages of this Wiki than I'd dare admit to my wife. I think I learned even more from it. I'm a software consultant from Szeged, Hungary. In open source communities, you can find me mostly working on the FreeMarker and the RhinoInterpreter.

''Welcome. I just about ''lived'' at this Wiki for a couple months, browsing, reading, studying. It's the fault of this Wiki that I've gotten interested in FunctionalProgramming, RubyLanguage, parsing, PhilDick novels, and I don't know what else! -- ElizabethWiethoff''
