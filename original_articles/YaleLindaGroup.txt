The Linda Group, part of the Programming Languages and Software Systems group in the Department of Computer Science, explores a variety of research topics in parallel and distributed computing, adaptive computation, parallel programming languages, groupware and information systems. Much of this work centers around the Linda programming language or ideas that have been spawned from work on the Linda system.
