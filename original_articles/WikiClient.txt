Has anyone ever thought of writing a web browser based WikiClient? I have in mind a stand alone program that connects to wiki and presents itself as a wiki interface. A simple html renderer would probably be needed, but that's readily available on all platforms in some sort of component form.

What features could make this a worthwhile project. A WikiSpider for enhanced search? A better spell-checker certainly. "WysiWyg" editing certainly.

''I do not agree, although wiki markup is fairly simple many people avoid wiki use due to the syntax. I think a true wysiwyg editor would accelerate wiki use by less technical people.''
