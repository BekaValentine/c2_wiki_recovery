Howdy,

I've been interested in patterns for a while now as you can read on my page in the PortlandPatternRepository, Steve Peterson Bio (http://c2.com/ppr/about/author/steve.html).  My main interests these days is to make sure that the patterns I write are useful to someone 
and that a dialogue exists between the patterns community and the object analysis and design folks.  The former is an easier task as I actively promote the use of the StarSchema pattern language at Sequent Computer Systems (http://www.sequent.com).  The latter goal is something I aspire to when engaged in conversations with folks from either group.
