GrossExaggeration is a communication that is blown out of proportion. It is different from a viewpoint that is misleading due to contextual matters (need a better term for this instance).

It is a viewpoint that is valid to some extent, but carried to an extreme that degrades its validity (or usefulness, see TautologicalDefinitionFallacy).

A complains about B as temperamental, whereas in real life B is usually a jovial person, except in the instance observed by A where A initiated an unwarranted verbal attack. This is a case of GrossExaggeration, as well as misrepresentation because A deliberately provoked B into the responses observed.
