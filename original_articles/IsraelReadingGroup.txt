The Israeli PRG is a joint academy-industry forum for the study of software patterns and their applications. We try to promote joint learning by dividing the effort of studying the wealth of advanced material published about patterns. Each member chooses a topic and presents it to the group in one of the meetings. These presentations are usually accompanied by discussions that advance further learning. 

We meet about once every other week. Each meeting takes about 2 hours and consists of two sessions. Further discussion is continued in the group's mailing list, or in private.

Can I subscribe to the mailing list?

Is this group still active?
www.kinetica.com is nowhere to be found...
