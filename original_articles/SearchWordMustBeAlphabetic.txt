The FullSearch capability doesn't include tokens like 'xp2001' which can make it hard to search for certain interesting topics.

FullSearch also excludes high-ASCII and other UniCode characters.  So searching for Jørgen is right out.

(This is typically handled by converting letter forms to their closest AsciiCode equivalent when indexing (Jørgen -> Jorgen), and doing the same with the search term when searching.)
