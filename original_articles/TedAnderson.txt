I am Ted Anderson, my home page[1] is the best place to find biographical information.  I found WikiWikiWeb while looking for information on Gamma's "Design Patterns" and it came up again in connection with QuickTopic.
My principle interest these days is developing a global DistributedFileSystem, however, I find hardly anytime to actually work on it.
