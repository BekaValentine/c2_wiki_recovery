AppFuse is an open-source Java EE web application framework. It allows developers to get started quickly and easily using Java open-source technologies like Spring framework, Hibernate and Struts. It was originally created by Matt Raible. He originally developed it to eliminate the "ramp up" time he found when building new web applications for customers.
