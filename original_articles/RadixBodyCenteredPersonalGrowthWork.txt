Radix - Body Centered Personal Growth Work (http://www.radix.org) is a method of PersonalDevelopment that focusses on releasing emotional blocks held in the body in order to experience life more fully and to live more purposefully.  It was originally developed in the late 60s and 70s by CharlesKelly and based on the work of WilhelmReich.  It is similar to, but differnt than, BioEnergetics.

The work mainly consists of sessions either in an individual or group setting aimed at identifying and releasing emotional blocks.  These blocks inevitably end up stored in the body and limit our ability to act naturally and be fully in the moment.  --BillKennedy
