The NewTek Video Toaster was the KillerApp of the AmigaComputer.  Take that, mid-80's Macintosh, with your DesktopPublishing!

Contemporary computers, including the iMac, now support digital video editing.  I wonder, though, if iMovie 2 can do chromakey.

''No, i don't think iMovie2 can do chromakey. But FinalCutPro can. -NateKlauer''

Not in realtime it can't. The dedicated Toaster hardware made that possible. Software only can't do that.

Do you think there's a market for actual VideoToaster'''''s   p.s. is there a wiki/site/suggested pages for NewInventions and gadetry (such as toasters that really do play video as you cook:) ? -- sw
