Perhaps not, biodegradable however...

'''Biodegradable cell phone covers''' (10/12/2004)

Here's a blooming good idea. Toss that old handphone cover onto a compost pile (or potted soil for HDB sky dwellers), and weeks later this morphs into a sunflower, thanks to a seed embedded in the cover. The idea, still under germination in the labs of the University of Warwick, biodegradable plastics maker PVAXX Research & Development and Motorola, seeks to ease the burden of recycling on our much-abused planet which faces some 650 million phones being sold this year alone. Why stop at flowers? We could soon be growing our own edible vegetables and bulbs all from discarded cell phone casings. 

nice idea, but OffTopic DeleteThisPageSomeTime

I have no idea why, but this page made me think of NivensManholeCoverQuestion.

''Why stop at cellphones? Tablets, laptops.. a biodegradable car could contain a whole garden''

Edible tablets seem reasonable. Biodegradable plastic is a reality. It can be used to put over crops and decays so that it does not pollute the soil. Now what about punched cards...  -- JohnFletcher
