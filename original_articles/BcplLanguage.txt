BCPL is a simple typeless language that was designed in 1966 by MartinRichards and implemented for the first time at MIT in the Spring of 1967.

It was the implementation language for the Tripos portion of the Amiga operating system, so many Amiga developers ended up being familiar with at least some aspects of BCPL.

Current (2004) implementation available at MartinRichards' site http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/mr/BCPL.html

"BCPL was the systems programming LanguageOfChoice at Cambridge, because it generated code better than the IBM Fortran compilers while not requiring the agony of Assembler." (In case anyone was wondering what the point was back then.)
