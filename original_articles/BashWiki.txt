This project is discontinued.
If you want the sourcecode, mail me: bashwiki@jandankert.de
Attention: The source has some security problems (that's one of the reasons the project has been stopped). You have been warned. :)

There is another project which goes by the same name:
http://dokucode.de/index.php/BashWiki

It is based on Haserl, a project which allows one to use bash-scripts in a cgi-context.
