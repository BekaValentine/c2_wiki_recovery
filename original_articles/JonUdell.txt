Jon develops http://www.byte.com/, and writes about it.  His May (1996!) article (http://www.byte.com/art/9605/sec9/art1.htm) describes adding conferencing to the site.

Jon may write about being a "knuckle scraping Neanderthal," but today programs in Perl, a language with no data types, but sweet on data structures. (BenSmith)

Two years later: BYTE bit the bullet. Jon's on his own, writing a book on Internet groupware. Now reachable at mailto:udell@monad.net. The former BYTE newsgroups have moved as well. They were reachable from  http://udell.roninhouse.com/talk/newsgroups.html but are now served up by news.devx.com. (You may be asked to log in once -- try a blank password.)
------------------
October 1999: Now Jon's newsgroups are back at BYTE.com. And his new book, PracticalInternetGroupware (http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pracintgr/), has just been published by O'Reilly and Associates.

Jon has an RSS channel where you can catch up with his weekly column and other doings; see http://udell.roninhouse.com/.

''[Also at WikiWikiKudos.]'' Jon wrote a column for BYTE on May 1, 2000 (http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2000-04-26.html) titled "Newsgroups And The Wiki Way Why Heads, Decks, And Leads Matter." In it, he calls this wiki "one of most remarkable -- and long-lived -- online collaborations in existence, radical in that every document is editable, always, by every user." 

Thanks, Jon! Francesca

More years later: In 2002 I find myself at the intersection of Wiki and weblogs; see http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/04/04.html#a171. What a fascinating mix of online communities, styles of information architecture, and modes of communication. 

I love the fact that this page has been alive for seven or more years, gradually accreting small bits of my history. -- JonUdell

I finally got to meet Ward in person, at a gathering convened by ClayShirky. A couple of months later, I interviewed Ward for a column I wrote in InfoWorld (http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/02/13.html). It was a real treat.  -- JonUdell
