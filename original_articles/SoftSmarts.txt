Maker of early Smalltalk for the IBM PC. Founded by SteveBurbeck and AbdulNabi. Keynoter AlanKay criticized this advertisement for the SoftSmarts product at the first oopsla, much to the dismay of the folks who had worked so hard to make Kay's baby available to the pc world. Kay's criticism: the "subject" is people, not objects or any other technology.

The program running on the screen in this advertisement is Plumbin', a class exercise devised by WardCunningham for an advanced Smalltalk class taught at Tektronix in the early eighties.
