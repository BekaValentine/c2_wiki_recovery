What about a free escrow service for the transaction of intangible goods. Is it feasible? Is there some OpenSource software to be build upon?

Programmer-oriented stuff may be better expanded here on WardsWiki, community oriented discussion or even real pilot transactions in the form of OpenBusiness or ExtremeOpenBusiness
might be better located at the MeatballWiki or what do you think?
