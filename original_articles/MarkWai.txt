I am a OO consultant working at FSA (http://www.frontiersa.com).  My main specialty is teaching and mentoring Smalltalk to new Smalltalkers.  At the same time, I always also ended up with doing a lot of architecture, design, modelling and implementation for my client.

Besides working as a consultant for my living, I have a keen interest on 'practical' research projects.  Currently, I am working on an object oriented pharmacokinetics project with a graduate student at University of Toronto.  The other research project that I am working on is the Language Mapper which is used to allow non-alphabet language (e.g. Chinese) to be used in Smalltalk programming.
