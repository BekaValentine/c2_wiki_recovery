Perhaps. Were I a magic user, I would hack that rather than computers. And I'm sure wizards have a better method than wiki for collaborative thinking. Of course, Wiki is only for Muggles. Wizard families tend to be so out of touch with technology that they get surprised by anything more complicated than a safety match. Whilst some mudbloods may be able to use Wiki, most wizard families wouldn't be able to figure it out.

I couldn't help but notice in the movie of The Goblet of Fire, how long it took them to track down the solution to the breathing under water problem.  I mean, it seems like aquatics would be a pretty common UseCase for magic - and yet it took days of research to find even one of the three solutions seen in the swimming challenge.

Imho, Hogwarts library must be really, really poorly organized.  Potter really needs a wiki.

''It's probably more the case that the story involved very inexperienced practitioners.  I've been a professional programmer for ~15 years. There are lots of programming situations in which I see an obvious answer, code it, and move on. I know that those answers never would have occurred to me when I was Harry's age, and I'd have thrashed about for days before implementing something that sort-of solved the problem, but had all kinds of hidden issues. I've read some of the code I wrote at 16... -- TimLesher''

Out of touch, surprised, not able to figure it out - If they become QuickChangesJunkie''''''s, they will eventually catch on! Most people on this wiki however resort to clear thinking and reason, not magic, sorcery, and wizardry, other places are better suited to mugglery. ''Aren't you saying that wiki is an essentially muggle place?'' No, I'm saying that wizardry jargon is better suited to another site. I do not, nor do I intend to mess with wizardry definitions or anti-definitions.

''You'll have to face the fact that a very large portion of geekdom love Harry Potter. In a strictly platonic sense, ahem. And therefore the terminology of hogwarts is bound to infect geekdom. This is not evidence of people being superstitious - in general, people who "truly" believe in magic dislike Harry Potter.''

If you're wondering what a "muggle" is, see: http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict2&Database=jargon&Query=muggle
'''In other words, a muggle is someone who does not belong.''' To find a muggle, one must first be familiar with what they are not, a baited hook for dumb fish.

Is it another way of saying "geek"?

Nope, the opposite, muggle is a way of saying ordinary, boring, not a wizard.

Louis Armstrong used the word ''Muggles'' for cannabis. As a JazzMusic fan, I had to smile when I read HarryPotter.

''Have you never read one of the many fan-fiction parodies, entitled "Happy Pothead and the Sorcerer's Stoned?''

Perhaps worryingly, my first reaction to this page was ''Of course it is (only for muggles) - there are no such things as non-muggles.'' [All going according to the ministry's plans...]

On the JargonFile file, Wiki is a NonMuggle space. If you don't Wiki, then you are a muggle.

''(Pregnant pause whilst we wait for some naysayer to label this page O''''''ffTopic - hurry! Label it W''''''ikiOnWiki first instead!)'' Ah, CategoryHumor.

Well, the thing about wizards is that magic frys out electronic equipment, so I doubt if a wizard could wiki if he wanted to.

''No way, what is a program but an encantation, a written spell to cause something to happen. It's not called TheWizardBook for nothing.  That makes non programmers muggles.''

Sadly Wiki is not yet SufficientlyAdvancedTechnology.

Im saddened by the distinct lack of SufficientlyAdvancedTechnology in our society, I know enough physics and chemistry to look at things and think 'that's not magic because ...'. I don't claim to be brilliant at either but there are too many easy logical explanations for things. Of course, because of this I long for nothing more than the magic to be real, although it makes me sad: as I am 18 I am obviously not magical. I envy all those under the entry age to Hogwarts as they can hold on to the dream. *sigh*

Ah-ha, there's your problem.  Anything is magic to someone who doesn't understand it.  So if it's magical, you just don't know much about what goes on under the hood.  The sad implication of this is that there will ''never'' be magic for the engineers and geeks; they're the ones making the magic happen.
