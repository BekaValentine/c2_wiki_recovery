Creator of IconixProcess. One of the most vocal opponents of ExtremeProgramming, probably because his career depends on Iconix, which competes with XP because it's in the same lightweight vein. One of the AuthorsDontCode crowd, possibly? (That's just speculation, PleaseComment.)

Co-author of ExtremeProgrammingRefactored with MattStephens. Also wrote UseCaseDrivenObjectModelingWithUML with KendallScott.
