As an XpCoach I used to work at ThoughtWorks and ObjectMentor, and spent a spell at ExoftWare. I'm the third independent signatory to the AgileManifesto,
As JustaProgrammer I worked at PanasonicOwl (CeePlusPlus, JavaLanguage), and FiveRuns and EdgeCase (RubyLanguage)

I worked for myself for a while, but these days I work for LivingSocial. 

I spent some time in the RubyLanguage and  JavaLanguage + IntellijIdea, but I've programmed in BasicLanguage, FortranLanguage, CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus.  I'm currently working in ObjectiveCee / CocoaFramework.

I organise the ScottishRubyConference and NsScotlandConference every year.

I have 1 wife, 2 kids and 5 Macs, 7 iPhones, 6 iPads and 1 iPadMini.
