The StolenConceptFallacy consists of using a concept while denying its hierarchical roots. For example, making an argument that relies on the concept of "motion" while denying that there are such things as physical objects. This is fallacious, because the whole concept of "motion" is predicated upon the existence of physical objects that move.

ConceptsOutOfContext is an instance of this; the ''context'' where a concept is applicable is one of its hierarchical roots. You cannot define the concept until you have a grasp of the context in which it applies.
