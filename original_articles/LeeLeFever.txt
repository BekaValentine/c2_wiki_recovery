Good Wiki people,
My passion is online communication and I see wiki as something that could fit into our collaborative future.  So, I'm doing my best to get it figured out.

I believe that we're just starting to see the possibilities in using the Internet to collaborate and communicate.  My personal interest is helping companies use nascent communication tools to address organizational communication problems. 

I have a blog site called Communication Culture and it focuses on observing, experimenting with and discussing online communication, plus just about anything that catches my eye. Here is the link to my site: http://www.leelefever.com.

I'm posting an entry today about my experience here.  If you want to see what I wrote, click here: http://www.leelefever.com/archives/000081.html#000081
