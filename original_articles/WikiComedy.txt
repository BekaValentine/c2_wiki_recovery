A man was walking in the woods when he stumbled upon a chest of gold coins.  He thought "this chest must belong to someone of great wealth" and decided to wait nearby in case the owner of the chest returned so he could rob him of the wealth.  ( the joke been that the man could just take the coins and thus avoid the need for a length wait and the subsequent criminal act ).   Taken from Molvania travel guide
