Hi! I'm MikeElliott. (Recursive reference?)

I live in the UK and I'm currently studying for an M.Sc. in Professional Computing. The subject of my dissertation is "The Two Way Web" - so I'm particularly interested in WikiWikiWeb and what it can (and cannot?) do.

This page was originally created on 21/09/2001.

Well, a lot of water has passed under the bridge, but I passed my Masters in July 2003. My final dissertation was entitled "The Two Way Web - From Dream to Reality" and was about adding images to Wiki pages.
