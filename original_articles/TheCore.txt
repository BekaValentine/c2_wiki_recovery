Set of patterns in SoftwareForYourHead book (Core Protocols for Creating and Maintaining Shared Vision)
by JimMcCarthy, MicheleMcCarthy.

"A collection of ResultsOriented ideas and practices that will reliably yield high performance teamwork for any team committed to achieving it. The name of this collection is TheCore. TheCore is like an OperatingSystem. Instead of running on processors in machines, TheCore runs in the minds of people on teams. It is software you run in your head. Those who choose to run TheCore will continue to do so only because they find that it favorably affects their results."

Can someone familiar with this book complete this bullet list of TheCore practices, possibly citing existing Wiki pages that might relate? (This might still best belong under the book's page.)

	* '''Pass / Unpass Protocol''' -- You can pass on any activity except voting.  In particular, you can check in without sharing your feelings.
	* '''Check-In Protocol.''' -- Almost, but not quite, entirely unlike the XP StandUpMeeting and the daily ScrumMeetings.  One shares current emotional state, and commits to participate in the team, but does not share status -- done, todo, blockers.
	* '''Check-Out Protocol.''' -- If you are not FreshAndReady, take a break.
	* '''Ask For Help Protocol.''' -- A clear and unambiguous way to ask for assistance. (They are free to say no without repercussions.)
	* '''Protocol Check Protocol.''' -- Used when you think someone is violating the protocols.
	* '''Intention Check Protocol.''' -- Used to question behavior that does not seem like it could produce a positive outcome.
	* '''Decider Protocol.''' -- Unanimous decision taking.  [includes "Resolution"]
	* '''Perfection Game Protocol.''' -- Invite others to improve your ideas, or offer suggestions on improving your performance of some specific task.
	* '''Personal Alignment Protocol.''' -- A way to state what you most want (to improve about yourself), and to engage others in helping you do so.
	* '''Investigate Protocol.''' -- A non-confrontational way to find out more about another person or their ideas.

It seems that the Check-In Protocol's model of emotions always being a combination of MAD, SAD, GLAD and AFRAID is similar to / based on / has similar roots with Robert Plutchik's two axis "Rage - Terror / Ecstasy - Grief" "Wheel of Emotions"
