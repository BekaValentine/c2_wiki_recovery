Kent Sandvik (INFP programmer, believe it or not) is currently working for EXcite@Home doing software design and implementation of broadband portals. He recently installed UseModWiki for keeping track of the design patterns for the next version of the broadband portals. He did ExtremeProgramming by mistake at earlier project assignments, didn't know the term but used the techniques as they make sense.
