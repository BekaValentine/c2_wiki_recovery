In early Smalltalk implementations, an ObjectTableEntry provided a reference to an object. For an allocated object, the ObjectTableEntry provided the memory address and size of the object to the virtual machine. For a "free entry" (unallocated object), the ObjectTableEntry pointed to the next free entry -- allowing the virtual machine to more easily manage storage.
