Originally a traditional methodology kind of guy, I've become a convert to the cause of ExtremeProgramming. My current role is XP advocate at Khatovar Technology (http://www.khatovartech.com), providing XP services in the Asia Pacific region.

Steve was responsible for the introduction of XP to the Credit Technology area of GoldmanSachs and coached the team for over a year.

Prior to that Steve worked extensively in Smalltalk and developing financial software (and often both at the same time).

He and his wife Amanda live in Melbourne, Australia.
