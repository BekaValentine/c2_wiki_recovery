From http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/NuBus.html:

	 :	NuBus is the expansion bus for versions of the Macintosh computers starting with the Macintosh II and ending with the Performa. Current Macs use the PCI bus.

Certain TI machines (like the S1500 and Explorer series) used NuBus.  A NuBus was also used in the Next cubes.
