It can be said of theHyperLink, "I link therefore I am".

Or I don't link, therefore I am not -- OnlineOrInvisible.
''As far as to those seeing via linking HyperTags are concerned.''

The ubiquitous hyperlink has become a means of identification of things real and imagined. It might even be said that in a browser, if a hyperlink returns a 200, the artifact to which it points to '''is'''.

With the most probable emergence of HyperTags almost everywhere and at an almost explosive rate, printed and signed media will never again be the same. Advertising and branding identification will carry the small footprint of HyperTags embeddedwithin, or transmitted from the location of the visible artwork. Perhaps a new form of subliminal messages in a form somewhat like cookies will become part of available linking and tracking mechanisms, and will make the media presenting or making links available also a recorder of the users who scanned the HyperTags, either by Id or simply by count. This would be a measure of the link effectiveness.

Scenario for the future:

Imagine driving along a highway of the future which has signs with HyperTags as well as or instead of the visible Media messages. The car has a DisappearingComputer installed in it which is H''''''yperTagAware. It has built within it GPS information downloaded from the successor to the WWW which includes geolocated advertisements (a sort of colored-pages) In addition to these somewhat dated, or possibly outdated information bits the auto has been scanning optically and receiving digitally information which is current for conveniently R''''''eachableArtifacts (reachable via the next or next few exits) for food, lodging, shopping or entertainment purposes. Since your DisappearingComputer has been accessorized to understand your speech, you can merely utter: I'm hungry, or I'm tired, or I need some fuel. It will, if enabled, present you with visual and audible suggestions, not limited to location alone, but also price and availability information as well.

P''''''rediction20080910: this scenario will be commonplace in as few as five years: 2013 or perhaps as early as 2010.

2011: Realized via the H''''''yperPhone (A cellular phone, equipped so as to provide G''''''eoLocale, with Camera):
* Take a picture of an Artifact at your location, and then receive information about it.
* Take a picture of an Artifact's BarCode, and receive information on where you can buy it near you and competitive pricing.

''"H''''''yperPhone"???  I presume you mean what everyone else on the planet calls a S''''''martPhone, yes?''

Yes, only not so limited in time and function, meaning having current, state-of-the-art functionality and connectivity. thus emcompassing utilitarian communication and use thereof. If I said "SmartPhone", and you did a search via Google, you would find many devices not even approaching what I describe, thus ''HyperPhone''. -- DonaldNoyes.20110706

A major problem with these scenarios is the provider of "information" (read, electronic sales brochure) about the artifact under scrutiny. It isn't like your car is going to interrogate Wkikipedia and check for multiple secondary sources on the info, is it?
