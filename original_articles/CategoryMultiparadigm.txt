CategoryMultiparadigm is for pages discussing multiparadigm programming and programming languages. There is a good summary of the links between object and functional paradigms on ObjectFunctional.

There are a number of pages which break the word up e.g. MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage but I am going to keep to one word for the definition of the category. 

What inspired me to create this category was finding the paper OoppExploringTheMultiparadigmShift. --JohnFletcher
