Describe DirkMeeussen here.
Hi, I 'am a SW developer working for a company in Belgium. I 'am responsible
for the coordination of a team of about 10 Java developers.
We are looking for tools to improve communication in the team.
Maybe Wiki Web is a solution. At this very moment I cannot yet evaluate it.
So I keep browsing around to try to understands its capabilities.
Greetings.
