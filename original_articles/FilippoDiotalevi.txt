Filippo Diotalevi

I work as J2ee consultant at Ibm Italy in Milan. My main interest areas are Patterns, AspectOrientedProgramming and AgileProcesses.

I'm coauthor of the Ibm Redbook "Direct Connections for Intra- and Inter-enterprise"; I occasionally write technical articles (mostly in Italian) for websites and magazines, and give speeches at conferences.

I collect my geek thoughts at http://www.jroller.com/page/fdiotalevi.

Two years ago, I founded the Java User Group Milano (http://www.jugmilano.it).
