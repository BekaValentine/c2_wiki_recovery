The LlamaPattern is pattern with an ambigous meaning created to show why patterns with a single name are dangerous. If the LlamaPattern ever becomes formalized, then all single-name patterns become useless because at best any word can become a pattern, at worst we will have widely varying definitions for any single word based pattern.

This is a meta-pattern - not a MetaPattern (which is an already defined pattern). That such a discernment is necessary reinforces that SingleNamePatternsCreateConflicts, and why multiple words should be used in the name of a pattern.
