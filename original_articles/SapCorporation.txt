'''ServiceOrientedArchitecture according to SAP'''

Its next generation architecture is called "Enterprise Services Architecture", constructed on top of NetWeaver. Challenges for a successful execution include:
* ability to modularize their ERP offerings
* ability to get a successful and diverse partnering program
* ability to provide infrastructure tools (e.g. in development, data management, etc)

'''SapCorporation QuickQuestions'''

'''Q''' What is the name given by SapCorporation for its ServiceOrientedArchitecture based product that will replace the legacy SAP R3? Is it My''''''Sap or Net''''''Weaver? And where is a good weblink to get an overview and commentary made by Industry observers?

'''A''' Supposedly, "SAP NetWeaver is the technical foundation of mySAP Business Suite solutions, SAP xApps composite applications, partner solutions, and customer custom-built applications. It also enables Enterprise Services Architecture, SAP's blueprint for service-oriented business solutions."

'''SAP R3 and beyond'''

SAP NetWeaver is actually the technology behind the mySAP ERP offering. SAP R3 itself was driven by "SAP Basis". There was an intermediate offering called "SAP R3 Enterprise" which has a Web application server engine at its heart that replaced the "SAP Basis". See a SAP Q & A at http://www.sapinsideronline.com/searchspi/search.htm?page=article&key=37900&query_text=mySAP+ERP for a clarification with diagrams (circa 2004).
