Lipson-Shiu personality types (see LipsonShiu) for various WikiZens, who are brave enough to admit it. (Along with a few other famous folks.)

* ILIG (Archangel)
** IanOsgood ''(difficult, isn't it? I had to look at the source quite a while to find a matching combination -- .gz)''

* ILIE (Grand Vizier)
** PeterMerel (finds torture ineffective)

* ILUG (Mensch)
** RonJandrasi ''(not surprising, as he's been called a mediator here!)''
** JonathanTang
** GunnarZarncke
*** must be one of strangest tests I have ever taken; sorry, I had to look at the page source, the scoring is - well - unusual by its asymmetry
**** ''And yet it's surprisingly accurate. Clearly "symmetry" is over-rated in this regard.''

* ILUE (Gremlin)

* ICIG (Entrepeneur)
** AalbertTorsius ''I would've guessed ICUG, given the explanations. Did it again later, and scored ICIE -- atleast I'm ICI.''

* ICIE (Torturer)
** DaveVoorhis ''Your safe word will be "Ouch!"''
** AndyPierce ''his grad students would agree''

* ICUG (Inventor)
** ClaesWallin
** NeilWalker
** ScottJohnson
** TomStambaugh
** DougMerritt

* ICUE (Mad Scientist/Hacker)
** EricHodges
** ElizabethWiethoff (but ICUG when I have nothing to feel adversarial about)
** IvanStojic (Trying the test a few days later pegged me as an ICIE)

* SLIG (Figurehead)
** GeorgeBush (though some might think he's a SLIE... he does what '''he''' thinks is the right thing, even if it's suggested to him by the large platoon of ILIEs he keeps company with)
** Strangely, this is the class closest to the Paladin in DungeonsAndDragons.  I guess George isn't experienced enough to have gotten Detect Evil.
** ''I don't get why you see this as similar to the Paladin. But BTW, '''I've''' got DetectEvil, but of course that doesn't qualify me to be a Paladin.''
** A Paladin would be more of a SLUG. See the description.

* SLIE (Pointy head)

* SLUG (Board Monitor)

* SLUE (Traffic Warden)

* SCIG (Celebrity)

* SCIE (Natural Disaster)

* SCUG (Apologiser)
** SeanCharles. I'm sorry, I tried. I tried hard to please, to not, please, to be honest and not cheat myself. And this is the thanks I get for it. Sorry. Maybe I couldn't help it, SC are my initials?
** StevenNewton Oops.
*** I think you meant "Oops -- sorry." :-)
* SCUE (Jinx)
