There is some controversy about the concept of a "tiger mom" or "tiger parent" in which one or both parents forces their children to practice and excel in school and musical instruments. The practice is mostly found in Asian cultures, but some suggest has aspects in Jewish culture also.

The evidence seems to be mixed: while it produces some of the most ambitious people there are, many seem to come out of it mentally scarred, and the suicide rate among Asian children is relatively high. I knew a lady that was in tears over similar pressure from her parents to marry a rich man even though she was in love with an upper-middle-class man. The technique is gambling with lives. -t
