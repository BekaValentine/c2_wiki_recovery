Stingray software has a good white paper on the relationship between MVC and Document/View (at least the MFC version). The original link disappeared after Stingray was purchased by RogueWave. The closest approximation that I could find is http://www.roguewave.com/products/whitepapers/mvcwp_wl.cfm. (Use caution, it has locked up my browser every time so far.)
