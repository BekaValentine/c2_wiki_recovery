''Books and those who read them'' ThinkingOutLoud.20110315 http://LibraryThing.com

What would we do without the old-fashioned printed books? The kinds that are stored on bookshelves and placed in libraries.

It is a GoodThing that Libraries exist since an individual has neither the space or the discretionary cash to buy every book which are on the reading list. 

While surfing today I discovered and OneNote''''''d some information about libraries all over the world. One library thing I took note of in this search was called that, LibraryThing.

It is a UserNamePassword with FreeAndCostPrivilege site. It has the following SelectionsViaTabs:
* Home | Profile | Your books | Add books | Talk | Groups | Local | More | Zeitgeist 

It is what I call a UserFriendlyMegaSite. It has many users from all over the world. It will be useful for all book, library, and collaborative tasks an individual or a team might want to utilize with regard to libraries and books.
