A NearLink in the context of WardsWiki means a WikiPage that is easily accessible by a person with a specific context. ''[Note: your grammar is unclear here, obscuring the meaning of this sentence. Please RefactorMe]'' See also TheFirstFiveClicks and SixDegreesOfSeparationTheory. 

For example, a lot of new users do not know the benefits of adding a C''''''ategoryHomePage to their WikiHomePage. And they would probably get curious about the addition of that category by a WikiGnome. So in that sense C''''''ategoryHomePage is a NearClick  for a WikiReader making their first contributions.

Note: NearClick is not NearLink, the latter being a term coined at MeatBall to refer to links to different sites.


''Thanks Earle for correction. I do not have a good rephrase of the first sentence. I think I meant something like the intention of the page is relevant to "a role" - a person with a N''''''ewUser hat. Too complicated for me now and I am very hungry and tired today.''  BTW I hope ProceedWithFear is more readable now, takes a while to improve my pages, but I do not forget them -- dl DeleteWhenRead
