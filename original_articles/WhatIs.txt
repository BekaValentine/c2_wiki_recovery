A method for creating WikiNames for pages that define terms. Typically, you would prefix the term you are defining with WhatIs as in WhatIsAnAgent. You can also use the methods described in WikiCategories as an alternative to using this WhatIs. These methods allow you to organize content without requiring the page to use a naming convention.

Also, a user-supported search-engine: http://whatis.com

They don't know:
* Wiki
* WikiWiki
* WikiWeb
* WikiEngine
* WikiForum
* SmartWiki
* WikiClones
* Ward Cunningham

Instead of suggesting them the above listed items piecewise, you might want to extend the list and send them a link to this page.

I'll move this stuff to MeatballWiki and leave a pointer here. -- FridemarPache
