Hiya

Im Miles Thompson.

A person. A java programmer. A life.

For now I cant be bothered writing much,
but feel free to http://switch.to/miles
and check out my home page...

Wow this entry has been here for a while. Nice.

My new site is at : http://www.utunga.com

;-)

Uhm. I went over to the dark side - I now code almost exclusively in MS C#. But I love it so sue me.
