A 20 something year old kid who enjoys Extreme Programming, Java, and toying around with his BASIC to Java Bytecode compiler.

Since recently, I've been employed at Siemens. Right now I'm working with Enterprise Application Integration software TIBCO (http://www.tibco.com/).

It's the same company that recently got some interesting press for suing the hell out of Apple: turns out that Apple was using TIBCO's registered trademark Rendezvous to name their zero-configuration networking. Apple since changed their technology's name to Bonjour.

In the meanwhile I've turned 26 and left my position at Siemens. I'm currently working in a small company specializing in consulting, design and development support with IBM's Rational tools. I get to write code, think about how to write code and most fun of all, I get to teach young programmers. I love working with people!
