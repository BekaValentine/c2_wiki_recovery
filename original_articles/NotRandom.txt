Why would you go out of your way to state that something is NotRandom?
----
Something may look entirely random, be random to all measurements, and yet be strictly determinate and therefore repeatable. The difference can be important. Testing is easier with repeatable input, but the system may require random data when running for real.
When a sequence appears random to some set of measurements, it is called pseudo-random.
The digits in the ValueOfPi appear random to many statistical tests, but are strictly determined.

Why do you ask?
