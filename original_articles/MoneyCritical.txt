Something that only costs money if it fails (rather than actually killing people) is MoneyCritical.  Most software is MoneyCritical.  MoneyCritical physical objects include battery-operated devices, inert objects, etc.  But even a bicycle is LifeCritical: bad brakes can ruin your whole day.

Something that is MoneyCritical is often subject to much lower defect rate standards than something that is LifeCritical.  Thus it can be made cheaper, or time and money can be spent making the MoneyCritical thing more functional.
