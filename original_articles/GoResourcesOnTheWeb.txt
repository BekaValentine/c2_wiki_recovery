* Internet Go Server: http://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/
* KGS: http://www.gokgs.com/
* Legend Go Server: http://www.lgs.hinet.net/eng/

Also there is a freeware go program, a 9x9 version of the ManyFacesOfGo available at
http://www.smart-games.com/igowin.html (but remember http://senseis.xmp.net/?IgowinIsBadForYourGame)

The OpenSource GnuGo is now on par with the commercial programs, and it has been ported to many platforms.  Downloads available from http://www.gnu.org/software/gnugo/gnugo.html. That page also has a number of Go related links.

For those people interested in an editor/viewer for go games (which can also let the user play against GnuGo), there is a decent freeware at
http://www.ruijiang.com/multigo/
