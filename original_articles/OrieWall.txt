Hi I'm an Architect turned Developer (through the CADD door).
I spent my formative years (late 1970's) working with Pattern 
Languages in Architecture so it was a natural for me when 
I discovered its was being applied to systems development
to say I'm excited is an understatement! My fellow
developers are very tired of hearing about Eli Whitney, Alexander
and other reusers of merit! I would very much like hearing from
you!
