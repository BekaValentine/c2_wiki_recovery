I'm a software developer in the Seattle area.  About me: computer games, patterns, science fiction ( especially HardSF ), C++, Lua, wintel, DataHand.

I think that Wiki is brilliant, a new paradigm.  My first visit was at least a year ago, and at the time I didn't "get it".  I was looking for software patterns and found things like BodyFollowsEyes which confused me.  This time, I'm actually contributing.  Subversive!

ReflectiveArticulation was my first attempt at writing.  Hopefully I didn't make too much of a hash out of it.  :-)
