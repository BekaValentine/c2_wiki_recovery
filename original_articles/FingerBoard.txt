''The FingerBoard combines the functions of a standard keyboard, mouse, and multi-hand and multi-finger gesture in a single device that's not much bigger than a regular keyboard.''

The familiar operations of typing, pointing, and clicking are combined seamlessly with multi-finger gesture in the same overlapping area of the FingerBoard's surface. With the FingerBoard you never have to reach for the mouse - it's always under your fingertips. Switching between typing, mouse, and gesture is effortless and does not require you to move your hands or to input any special commands.

The FingerBoard was also designed to reduce the strain and injury associated with CarpalTunnelSyndrome (aka repetitive strain injury or RSI). But the FingerBoard provides a lot more than safer computing. In addition to its ergonomic attributes, the FingerBoard gives you unprecedented control of graphical objects while providing you with the same functionality of the keyboard and mouse. The FingerBoard allows you to sit back in your chair and have complete control of your computer.

Has anybody noticed how much it looks like the keyboard in TronMovie (part of the badguys desk)?

''It also looks a lot like the current round of StarTrek (TNG, DS9, Voyager) control panels.''

I, for one, would not like to type on a keyboard that doesn't give tactile feedback. -- MichaelSchuerig

I feel the same way. But they also have a version that is integrated into a normal keyboard. The ability to control with gestures from your hands/fingers seem really powerful.

''If they just made a version that fitted on the KinesisKeyboard (there should be plenty of space in the middle), it would be perfect.''
