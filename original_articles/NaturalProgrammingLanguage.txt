This article presents findings on natural (i.e. intuitive in the UserCentric way) programming languages.

It advocates features for programming languages, that are justified by these findings.
Areas include:
* SyntacticSugar, that causes fewer errors (it more intuitive/''natural'').
* Better integrated debugging-support, esp. for hypotheses about bug-causes.
