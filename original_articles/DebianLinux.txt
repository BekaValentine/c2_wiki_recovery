The more correct name for DebianLinux is actually DebianGnuLinux. Debian simply finds the request the FreeSoftwareFoundation makes (http://www.gnu.org/gnu/why-gnu-linux.html) fair, so they use the name Debian GNU/Linux very consistently.

See GnuLinux for further informations on Linux vs. GNU/Linux.
