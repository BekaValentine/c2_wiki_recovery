Hi, I'm Ole

I'm working with agile projects in Denmark. My employer is Capgemini - where I'm a managing consultant in the department for "Project- and Test Managers".
I spend most of my time on projects, but I also like to talk and write about Agile. My website www.olejepsen.dk is mostly in danish, but there are a few articles and subjecs in english...

Regards, Ole
