This page gives clues as to how I have chosen to keep track of and use RecentChanges by using a local .pdf file containing the links.

Details are being preserved, with the first of my trials being done for the following periods:
* 20141201-20141217
*** c2.rc.bc1412cm.pdf
* 20141218-20141224
*** c2.rc.bc1412re.pdf
* These allow me to reference meaningful changes without going into the present Bot-War-Zone
* At first I considered posting these to an alternative web-site, but decided rather to preserve the changes in .pdf files, using WikiBatics, to avoid conflicts.
* To see why I did not use a posting method, see:
