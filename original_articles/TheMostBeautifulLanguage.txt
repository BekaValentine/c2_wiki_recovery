... is HaskellLanguage. Much prettier than RubyLanguage.

Also a gagillion times faster - potentially FasterThanCee on modern architectures. And soon, with NDP on the GPU, so much FasterThanCee that C will never, ever catch up ... ''This all sounds like a bit of SufficientlySmartCompiler jabber. Did any of this pan out? --ArlenCuss''  Show me a Haskell chess program as strong as Stockfish, or even Fruit, and then I'll consider such a ridiculous claim. --IanOsgood

And a lot safer. Haskell typing is static and strong even though it is pretter than RubyLanguage. For example you can't write a QuickCheck in Ruby no matter how many layers of Rails you cobble on top ...

xmonad is an X window manager written in Haskell. It is very much slower than dwm, the window manager upon which it is based, written in C.

The most beautiful language would be one that uses supermodels as syntax.

{APL had a special keyboard just for it; SM++ should also, braille-like. Or is it SMDD?}
