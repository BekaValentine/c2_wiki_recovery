Having read the referenced articles, I agree with the comments that another name needs to be chosen, one that will give the '''ScapeGoat''' some pride in the title.  A MontyPython-esque attempt is '''NoneShallPass''', along the lines of the Horatius suggestion, but with more humor to the sometimes arbitrary nature of the demands.  I like the metaphor of holding back the chaos so that others can progress, so I'd suggest other names from the history of war - like the stand at Thermopylae. --PeteHardie

A good classical name would be '''Protesilaus''', one of the warriors at Troy.  It was fated the first off the ships would be the first to die, but he led the charge anyways.

What about '''SentinelHero'''

What about '''GateKeeper'''
