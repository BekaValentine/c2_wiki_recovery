A single software gets updated and breaks other related programs, third-party programs, and internal programs that properly use its exposed interface/contracts. 

Some IncompatibleSuiteUpgrade issues are:

	* Changing the documented interfaces to the upgraded software piece ''(ie: instead of func(x,y) it is now func(x,z,y).)''
	* Exposing undocumented interfaces.  ''Such interfaces '''will be''' misunderstood''.
	* Changing the pre-conditions or post-conditions of the contract in such a way as to invalidate some or all of the original contract.

I welcome anyone who wants to make a formal Pattern or AntiPattern/DarkPattern out of this to do so. -- WyattMatthews
