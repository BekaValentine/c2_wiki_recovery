TekWar originally was a ScienceFiction book written by WilliamShatner. It also became a made-for-TV movie and a short-lived TV series. WilliamShatner executive produced the movie and series and also directed some of the TV series episodes. 

''Shatner's name is on the cover, but wasn't it ghosted by RonGoulart?''

One of the memorable things from the TV dramatization was that the programmers used vivid hand and arm gestures to activate certain computer functions.
