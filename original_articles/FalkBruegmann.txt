I'm working as a software architect at PAY.ON AG in Munich, Germany. We provide turn-key solutions to payment service providers.
I've got a bachelor in business administration (BWL) and one in applied computer science (WI); at the moment I'm getting an MBA.
I'm an ENTJ according to MBTI, and a high-C/high-I according to DISC.
 
The C2-Wiki used to be a favourite time sink of mine for several years, and it has probably shaped my thinking and attitudes about software development more than any other source. Some pages that I started: CodeNormalization, IdealJavaEditor, MetaPattern, TheFifthVariable, ThingsOnWikisMind, PatternsInChess, LanguageTrends and WikiLanguageStatistic.
