The phenomenon that occurs after your boss (usually) has read AReallyGoodArticle and wants to try out what it suggests on you.  Normal sources of these magazines include airlines and dentists - probably the only time your boss actually sits still for 5 minutes, let alone thinks.  Any similarity between this behaviour and that of a 5-year-old is PurelyCoincidental.
