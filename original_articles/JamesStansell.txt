I have been programming computers since 1979.  For many years I worked for WilTelCommunications, based in TulsaOklahoma.  My recent large projects have primarily used the JavaLanguage.  For the last year I have been contracting for AllianceDataSystems, primary using PerlLanguage and StructuredQueryLanguage.

I am currently seeking a new opportunity.  There is some limited information about me at http://sourceforge.net/users/jamesstansell/.  I am especially interested in projects that combine ExtremeProgramming and OpenSource.  If you know of a project like that then please contact me.

For a JDBC driver for MS Access (MDB) files, http://sf.net/projects/mdbtools may meet your needs.  Check it out of CVS, or contact me if you like.  There is still room for much improvement, so your contributions are welcome and invited.
