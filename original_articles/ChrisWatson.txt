I enjoy spending my time reading SciFi books and browsing the internet.

I work as the Systems Adminstrator of an EnterpriseResourcePlanningSoftware system called CS/3 created by TetraSystems but recently taken over by SageEnterpriseSystems.

The CS/3 software runs on a HewlettPackard HP9000 / 821 running HpUX 10.20.

We use the software to run our sales and distribution business.

I have the amazing ability to persistently capitialize the same word over and over again. I call this phenomenon StickyShift.
