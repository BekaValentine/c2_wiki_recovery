A new toy from GoogleSearch:

http://www.google.com/codesearch

Search public SourceCode. Or not so public - try searching for "confidential".

* No guarantees that the code works
* No tests
* Not necessarily easy to understand
* No documentation
* Might not do what it says

Wow!  It's the perfect tool to support the GoogleAndPasteProgramming model!

Interesting idea/challenge.

I'd like to see a collection of proven (in the sense of FormalMethods) routines with tests, documentation, and with signatures from people I recognise as appropriate reviewers.  Then if I want a QuickSort or HeapSort, I know where to get it, and that it will work as advertised.

Is this really so hard?
