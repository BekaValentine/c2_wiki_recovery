The VultureSearchEngine is that search engine that takes over any website URL that was released--for example, http://www.aleph-lang.org/ has been taken by the VultureSearchEngine.

There is more than one SearchEngine that constitutes the VultureSearchEngine.

If you search things in Ask.com, often you will find that the Ask.com algorithm picks up things that probably used to relate to whatever it is that you were searching for, but were instead claimed by the VultureSearchEngine.  Ugh!

Related to ZombieUrl''''''s, and is one of the causes.
