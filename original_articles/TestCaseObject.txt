Several patterns where a test case is a class or object,
or a method of another class or object
(which is typically bound to create a freestanding object).

The test jig may be inherited by the test case object,
or bound to a test case method.

As opposed to a VoidFuncTest.

----

PRO: objects are good, allow flexibility

CON: imposes requirements on the environment that may be hard to meet for a simple library package being included in other prorams with different test frameworks.
