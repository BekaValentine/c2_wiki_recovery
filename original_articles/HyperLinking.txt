I first became interested in the power and versatility of hyperlinking back in the time of the BBSs. I had a machine which booted in MsDos and ran during the days when Windows 3.1 was the latest and greatest Windows. I bought some programs from NeilLarson, which included some utilities and a hypertext editor(Transtext). Later, I purchased a product called Houdini. At that time my machine, finances and vision were very limited, but I managed to find uses for these products in my work in industrial control systems to use for projects in the petrochemical and paper industries. This was before the Internet was widely accepted and most interactions between computer enthusiasts were via telephone modems. 

The company and its premier product is called Maxthink (latest version-August 30, 2004 - is Ver 1.64). A free 4.2 MB download is available allowing new users to self-install a Windows Version for a 30-day full-feature trial. Where: http://www.maxthink.biz/download.htm.

I believe the MsDos version of its hypertext editors and utilities and other associated programs are still available for those still capable of executing MsDos programs.

''The hyperlinking used Dos 6.22 as I recall. It was utilized using the keyboard, no mouse interface was utilized, the program used the back and forward arrows as well to move through the hierarchies.'' -- DonaldNoyes
