'' PowerTier for Enterprise JavaBeans Enterprise Server solution is the industry's first production-level EJB application server''

Generally available since August 1998, PowerTier is a comprehensive implementation of the Enterprise JavaBeans? 1.0 specification that dramatically reduces development time with container-managed persistent objects, optimizes performance with shared transactional caching, and improves application management with graphical tools and APIs. 

PowerTier for EJB Enterprise Server is a combination of leading-edge technologies that simplify the development, deployment, and management of distributed applications.

Unfortunately PowerTier interprets the EJB spec somewhat idiosyncratically. For instance, entity bean attributes are represented by public accessor methods rather simply through fields.

Also, PowerTier more or less mandates using fine-grained entity beans.
