I'm a part-time Java programmer, since I also work in Perl, Korn-shell, and occasionally ASP and VbScript on my church's website - http://valleywebs.org

I'm a really big fan of JavaUnit.

Currently I am trying to setup a framework making possible TestFirstDesign for this ASP website, and am thinking maybe XmlTestSuite might be the way to go.  It certainly looks impressive, although I've never done much with xml before.
