Dark and nefarious forces plot against that champion of truth, and agent
of The Light: GeekNight!

Yes, there is a 50% tube outage. No, we will not be cancelling. Why?
Adversity is what rallies us about our grand and noble cause (which is, we know not what)

In other news, apparently we have a special guest. It is rumoured that StevePurcell, author of PythonUnit will be here tonight. 

So, sign up as usual below:

Agenda:

	*MarathonMan -- I'm going to put this here, until someone comes up with something better to work on.
	*CruiseControlNet -- trying to get 1.0 out the door.  any help is appreciated. 
	*AspNetUnit -- discuss Jim's foray into unit testing for Asp.Net

Attendance: (name/pizza)

	*CharlesLowell -- pizza=true
	*OwenRogers -- pizza[veggie]++;
	*JimArnold -- pizza = (topping == Toppings.Meat);

Last week, I showed up, buzzed the buzzer, rang the office phone, knocked on the door - place looked dead.  Did GeekNight happen last week, and if so, was it in the usual place? Can someone send me a mobile number to ring tonight when I'm downstairs?  Cheers -- JimArnold

Jim, 
Yes, geek night happened. But is was only two people. Sorry about that. If you need to get into the door, call me on my mobile. the number is 07766320712 (and that goes for everybody)

Anyone who is stuck outside the office should try calling the office number... it's 020 7090 7415.  Keep ringing until someone answers.

Oh my god!  Replace 
	 :	pizza = (topping == Toppings.Meat) ? true : false;
with 
	 :	pizza = (topping == Toppings.Meat);
will you? :-)

''Yes, what '''was''' I thinking?  Where was my pair!!?''
