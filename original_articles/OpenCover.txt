A code coverage tool for .NET 2 and above, support for 32 and 64 processes with both branch and sequence points. OpenCover was created when the author decided to start afresh after a period of time maintaining another OpenSource code coverage tool for .NET see http://scubamunki.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/opencover-first-beta-release.html and decided that it would be simpler to start again.
