I am evaluating TogetherControlCenter and find very interesting functions and uses. Can someone give feedback about using it in a real project?

Features

TogetherSoft Control Center isn't just a UML modeling tool.  It is a full development platform that supports the software development process from requirements through testing.  It supports bi-directional updates between UML models and project source, so changes that you make to a model simultaneously update the corresponding project source (and vice-versa).  It can retro-engineer an existing project from its source which is very handy when you're trying to understand an undocumented application (which, of course, never happens).

Control Center is built in Java, so it runs under any Java-enabled platform.  The main distributions are: Windows, Solaris, Linux and generic Unix.  It requires a hefty machine.  I'm currently using a 2.4GHz Pentium 4 machine with 512MB ram and that works well.  The license is (very approximately) ~$1000/seat.

TCC has a full-featured editor that is somewhat reminiscent of IntelliJ's IDEA.  Matter of fact, the rumor-mill says that IDEA was developed by a group of programmers that spun off from Together.
