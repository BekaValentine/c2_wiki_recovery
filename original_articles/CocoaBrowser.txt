CocoaBrowser, by HoshiTakanori and MaxHorn, is an application for browsing through HeaderDoc-generated documentation for MacOsx's CocoaFramework.  An eminently useful app for the budding OS X developer.  Doesn't get InMyWay.  It's definitely OnMySide, as well.

Note to users of Xcode 1.5, Xcode 2.0 and greater:  You will want to use CocoaBrowser SN, updated by Satoshi Numata, available here: http://numata.aquasky.jp/programming/cocoabrowser/index_en.shtml
