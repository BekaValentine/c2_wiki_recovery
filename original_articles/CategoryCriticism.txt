A Category of pages which deal with the purpose and value of criticism.

'''critic''': One who forms and expresses judgments of the merits, faults, value, or truth of a matter. One who evaluates and appreciates literary or artistic works: a film critic; a dance critic.

Criticism is difficult to accept on valued and long held positions and is often viewed as an attack. When on the other hand it is viewed a framework which can aid in improving and enhancing an art or improving the functionality or precision of a set of actions or correcting a falsity in what one has held to be correct, it can be the first step in the formulation of the proper approach to the subject of criticism. It is both an agent of change and an agent of strength.
