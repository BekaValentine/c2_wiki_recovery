Born in 1958, Olof Forshell has been developing systems since 1982, systems where performance has been a functional (as opposed to non-functional) requirement.

His first programming was on the HP-25C calculator
His first computer programs were written in Basic, Fortran and Assembler on the DEC PDP-8/E


He has worked on embedded systems, train station information systems, communication systems, statistical routines, production systems etc.

He has developed in assembler for 27 years, C for 19, PL/M for 18, Clipper for 11.


Among his favorites over the years have been:

Applications where MS C, MS MASM, intel PL/M and intel ASM have been linked together into a functioning programs
A 16-bit PL/M x86 protected mode (Windows 3.1) program which allocated and efficiently used 32 bit memory
Creating computation functionality in C and linking them to a Clipper application
Various apps which peek into .obj and .map files and compile lists of various types of references


Olof lives just outside of Stockholm, Sweden.
