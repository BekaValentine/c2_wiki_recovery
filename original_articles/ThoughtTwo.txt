ThoughtTwo (Or more acurately Thought2) is a little perl script I wrote back in the tail end of 1999. It's basic function is to provide a dumping ground for thoughts I had. It had some search features and the ability to list alphabetically or chronologically (usefull for journalling thought). It can also have links to other thoughts and web pages embedded in the text.

It is a fairly simple bit of Perl I wrote, mainly to learn about Perl :-)

I'm currently updating my website and am re-writing thought2 in the process. It will still be vaguely wiki-like but probably more like Everything than a pure wiki. I'm also going to make it use a database for storing stuff instead of a flat file as I feel like brushing off my Perl skills.
