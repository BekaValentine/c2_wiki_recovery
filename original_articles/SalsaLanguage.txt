SALSA: Simple Actor Language System and Applications is a prototype programming language, dialect of the JavaLanguage, to develop concurrent active object (actor) systems for distributed environments, like the WorldWideComputer (WWC). 
A preprocessor moves SALSA source code into Java source code. SALSA-generated code uses an actor library and run-time support developed specially for execution of SALSA programs on top of the WWC.
