CategoryBook: ''The High-Flex Society: Shaping America's Economic Future'' by PatChoate and JuyneLinger, ISBN:0394536398.

Published back in the mid 1980's, argued the now common belief that American workers will need change to adjust to the global economy. This means learning a variety of skills, continuous learning, the death of lifetime employment, willingness to change jobs and even industries. The book was ahead of its time. Unfortunately, it's now out of print.
