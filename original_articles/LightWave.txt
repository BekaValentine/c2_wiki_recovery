Hmm, what is it they say about first loves? My first real experience with 3D graphics was LightWave on a Toaster4000. Since then, I've used numerous other programs, but LightWave still holds a special spot with me. Now, if only I could scrape up enough money to buy a copy.

What is LightWave and what is a Toaster4000?
