User Interface Integration is one of the three techniques used to perform EnterpriseApplicationIntegration. In UserInterfaceIntegration the SystemIntegrator writes programs that manipulate the UserInterface to extract and present data to the end user. UserInterfaceIntegration can also be used to build Web interfaces to gather data. -- DanMcCreary

Is the "extracting"-part the same as "ScreenScraping"? -- FalkBruegmann

No, the way I see it is that the User Interface will pull information from separate databases and present them to the User as a single page / form. To the users, they appear to be integrated but in reality the data comes from multiple sources. -- SimonMedley
