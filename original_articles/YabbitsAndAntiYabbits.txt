ThreadMode is great, but any kind of dialog can easily get off the path of healthy discourse and onto the path of YabbitsAndAntiYabbits:

	 :	''Up is up, and down is down, there's no arguing with that.''

	 :	''Yabbit, there's always sideways, and we have to consider that.''

	 :	''Yabbit, what '''I'm''' saying is that in turns of verticality, there is up and there is also down.''

	 :	''Yabbit, you're wrong in saying that, because of the whole left-to-rightness issue and how it intercedes.''

...and so on, ad infinitum...

If you find yourself saying 'Yeah, but...' too often in a dialog, whether you use those simple words or not, give it a re-think.  On the other hand, if someone's yabbiting ''you'', it's a good time to OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard.
