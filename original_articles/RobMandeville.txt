I'm a software developer/release engineer in New England, USA.  I've been
programming professionally for 20 years, and have picked up a number of languages and technologies.  I've meandered towards release engineering in the past decade, and am currently a dev/ops and release engineer at Deka Research (http://www.dekaresearch.com; the guys who invented the Segway, among other things).  I've had a lot of experience in large-scale Agile software development (recently acting as release engineer for an 80+ developer team at a credit card processor).
