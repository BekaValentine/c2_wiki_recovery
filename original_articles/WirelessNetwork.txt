There are several types of WirelessNetworking. 

This is a very interesting technology, and it appears that with the InterNet going the way it is, it may go to the corporate interest rather than the PublicGood. BlueTooth and some of the new 'standards' being set are designed to be a cap on your broadband access rather than be the new provider of access.  WirelessNetworking has potential when you look at it for use in CommunityNetworks
