Visibility of class members is almost the same as in C++, with a couple of important exceptions:

''Default (no visibility specified)''
	* Not visible outside the class, '''except for classes in the same package'''
	* Not visible from subclasses
''Private''
	* Not visible outside the class
	* Not visible from subclasses
''Protected''
	* Not visible outside the class, '''except for classes in the same package'''
	* Visible from subclasses
''Public''
	* Visible outside the class
	* Visible from subclasses

Here is a test program to demonstrate visibility:

 /* T''''''estVisibility.java */
 class Classname {
   int defaultVar;
   public int publicVar;
   protected int protectedVar;
   private int privateVar;
 }

 public class T''''''estVisibility {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     Classname foo = new Classname();
     foo.defaultVar++;    // Visible within the package
     foo.publicVar++;     // Evidently public visibility
     foo.protectedVar++;  // Visible within the package!!!
     foo.privateVar++;    // Compiler error: privateVar has private access 
   }
 }
