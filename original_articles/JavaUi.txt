An enhancement to the CppUnit test framework that allows the tests that it produces to be run using the JUnit (JavaUnit) GUI interface. This makes the CppUnit framework a bit more platform independent and makes it easy for programmers that are using both C++ and Java to develop test suites that test all of their code.

JavaUi is a part of the CppBridge package which is an enhancement of the JavaUnit framework that allows it to run tests written for CppUnit to be run as if they were written in Java by turning them into shared libraries that are loaded via JNI.
