Among the primary functions of Wiki is communication amongst members. However, when Wiki is polluted as it is these days (January 2005) the communication is all but non-existent, due to noise pollution. QuickChanges are almost unusable, one doesn't know who's who from what proxy IP address and what are their motives.

Those are the reasons why I thought of creating a WikiChannel as a strictly backup solution for communicating amongst trusted members of WikiCommunity, when WikiNoisePollution is just too much to have an effective conversation on WardsWiki.

For lack of better technical ideas, I applied TheSimplestThing that came into my mind, and I created an yahoo mailing list where I am a moderator, reserving only the right to give access to group membership to email addresses from people that I can verify their identity (in order to prevent noise pollution). However, I kept the browsing of email archives as public (anybody can do it) in order to keep things in the open and avoid even the appearance of wrong doing (it's not an occult parallel channel for co-conspirators).

So all members of Wiki community here are invited to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wikichannel/. ThankYou -- CostinCozianu

Other people also want to set in place a contingency plan in case C2 goes offline for a couple of weeks. (Something to feed our WikiAddict''''''ion :-).
