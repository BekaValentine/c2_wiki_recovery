StevenFeuerstein is the living god of Oracle PL/SQL programming.
----
'living god': ''that's a bit much, isn't it? He's just this guy, you know... (apologies to Douglas Adams)''

A bio and list of his books is here at the O'Reilly Books site:
http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/344?x-t=book.view

Most significantly, he is the author or co-author of several advances in PL/SQL programming including the Unit Testing Framework for PL/SQL (PlSqlUnit), a definitive approach to PL/SQL exception handling (an extremely challenging area of that language for most beginners), and one of the first and arguably the language's best commercial code library, PL/Vision.
