I wonder if Christians really are a minority of the people who post to wiki? They certainly aren't a minority in the U.S. (where I suspect most wiki posters live) or the U.K., at least according to census:

* U.S.: Protestant 56%, Roman Catholic 28%, Jewish 2%, other 4%, sane 10% (1989)
** http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/us.html

* U.K.: Anglican and Roman Catholic 67%, Muslim 2.5%, Presbyterian 1.3%, Methodist 1.3%, Sikh 0.8%, Hindu 0.8%, Jewish 0.6%
** http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/factbook/print/uk.html

* More up-to-date statistics for Great Britain (excl. Northern Ireland) from the 2001 census:
* Christian 71.8%, Muslim 2.8%, Hindu 1.0%, Sikh 0.6%, Jewish 0.5%, Buddhist 0.3%, Spiritualist 0.06%, Pagan 0.05%, Jain 0.03%, Wicca 0.01%, Rastafarian 0.009%, Bah��0.009%, Zoroastrian 0.007%, no religion (incl. facetious answers such as JediKnight) 15.1%, question not answered 7.8%.
** http://www.statistics.gov.uk/focuson/religion/

Please explain why JediKnight is a facetious answer and Roman Catholic is not? Because we're a minority? That doesn't seem very fair. Or is it cos Jedi was invented more recently than Christian? ''Cos Jedi? May I ask what the cosine of "Jedi" is?''

I guess one has to differentiate between 'social' religion and 'believed' religion. You might answer differently 
* on an official questionaire (which may be relevant for taxes e.g.) 
* between your close friends and relatives
* in your heart/diary
* in church

''Who's the leader of the club that's made for you and me ... '' 
All those Americans old enough to recognize this refrain should get their own minority listing! ''I thought the OldFart''''''s already had a section.''

''Emm Eye Cee, Kay Ee Why... I am 24.''

[The leader of the club that's made for you and me... It rings a bell. What song would that be?] Think "Annette Funicello"
----
''I'm open to a new category name, but not some "Mickey Mouse" classification (see above) that was after my time anyway. Think of some name that involves relays, vacuum tubes, punched cards, star wheels, or paper tape (but not that newfangled type with the optical sensors)! 
----
''The Babbageers?''

''My First Computer was a Difference Engine?''

And if Old Farts are NOT in the minority, why is it that no one else has signed on?

Many possibilities but FacingTheInevitable must rate high on the list.
----
Should there be a separate page for those GroupsOnWiki that have representatives here but perhaps do not wish to be exposed? eg, terrorists, crackers, deviants, criminals or - horror - politicians.

''Anyone who adds their name to a list on this page may find a brief moment of comfort and solidarity with other minority groups. Before the ''real'' persecution starts...It's about to start, all in good fun of course.''

(I presume it's considered bad form to add ''someone else's'' name to any of the categories here?)

Apparently not. Didn't stop someone adding mine.

Quandary! Multiple inheritance problem. Do I post myself under "The Christians," "The Embedded Systems Programmers," "The Avid Cyclists," or "The Old Farts?" Bummer.

Why not add your name to multiple categories? It's a free Wiki, right? (free as in not ruled, not as in not paying for it, but either are true)

Okay, done.

[Scene: Bloom County, ''Binkley'' talking to his ''dad'' (who is still half-asleep in bed).]

''Binkley'': Well, dad, I guess it's safe to say we aren't exactly a couple of short, Hispanic, Hindu, French-speaking physically handicapped Communist gay black women.

''Binkley'': Nope, in every regard, we're hopelessly in the majority. Ethnically, religiously, physically, economically, politically, educationally, sexually and gender-wise... we're in the solid majority.

''Binkley'': For crying out loud, we're not even in the "Moral Majority" minority.

''Binkley'': ''<shouting>'' In fact, we're as majority as you can get! And there's darn few of us left! Do you realize what that makes us?

''Binkley's Dad'': A minority.

''Binkley'': Right. I'm going to bed. Power, brother. ''<raises fist in air>''
----
Paraphrased from LifeOfBrian:
 Binkley: You don't need to follow me! You are all individuals! 
 Crowd (in unison): Yes! We're all individuals!
 solitaryVoice: I'm not.

''Ironically, this was also used by Brian (the dog on Family Guy) in the witness protection/redneck episode.''

Remember that you are a unique individual, just like everyone else. (http://www.despair.com)
