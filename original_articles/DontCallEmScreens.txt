Today, a lot of software is designed to run on computing devices with window systems.

Some of it uses phrases like ''the next screen'' and ''the login screen'' to refer to things that are not screens, such as dialogue boxes or web pages.  

''So, what's wrong with that? "Screen" is a fairly well-understood term for a chunk of UI that has to be interacted with before you can go anywhere else. While it sounds a little odd to PC-centric types, it's not hard to understand. --MichaelGates''
