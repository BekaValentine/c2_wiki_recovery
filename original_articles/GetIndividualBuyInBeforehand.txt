When you need unanimous agreement from each member of a group, get each individual to buy in beforehand. Do several rounds of meetings with each member alone, building up to a situation where they each individually become convinced that only an idiot would say no. When the time for the group meeting and vote arrives, the whole issue is settled.

Almost any other approach risks getting at least one "no" on the judgement day.
