	* the KB should be comfortably '''fit in each hand'''
	{like DataHand}
	* '''cordless'''
	* '''small and light''' {as possible}
	* with an integrated '''3D-space-movement controlled mouse'''
	{without leaving the keys,{like the Twiddler, see homepage: [2] }}
	{but {unlike the Twiddler} for each hand}
	* no need for costly '''armchair integration'''
	{what is a good idea until now}
	* both hands and '''arms should have maximal freedom'''
	{like using a castanet} 
	{see: [1] for a picture of this musical instrument:-}
