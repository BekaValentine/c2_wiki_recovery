Legislation and rulings/decisions at the various federal and state/provincial levels:

** "Lyons v. Multari"  Reluctance of courts to enforce non-compete clauses where a non-solicit clause would suffice.
** "Kohler Canada Co. v. Porter"  Non-competition agreement not enforceable if signed after the start of employment and no additional consideration given (e.g., salary raise, promotion, etc).  Continued employment does not qualify as such.
