Steven (aka ferretman) is a (the?) demigod of Artificial Intelligence in Games.

He lives at http://www.gameai.com.

I met him on news:comp.ai.games when I was still in high school. This eventually let to the great fortune of collaborating with him and others on a book on Game AI for WroxPublishing. While it was never published, it was an extremely rewarding experience.

Steven has taught me a lot more than he may know.
