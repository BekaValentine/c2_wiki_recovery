One of the better GUI development IDEs (similar to VisualBasic, PowerBuilder, etc.).
The latest version is called Team Developer. Gupta also has a light to medium weight database product called SQLBase.

''What makes it one of the better ones?''

Google groups on SqlWindows and VisualBasic, and let me know if the VisualBasic info is out of date.
Basically in SqlWindows it is much easier/possible to create base classes for forms and screen
widgets and inherit from them, so it is much less work to create similar behaving forms/widgets/etc.
VisualBasic is better for small applications, and much cheaper, but SqlWindows comes with more
features out of the box.
