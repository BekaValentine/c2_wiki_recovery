RichBugReports, amongst other things, make it easier for people to track down and fix the bug: this _is_ the point, after all.

They incorporate:

	* Sufficient version-control information
	* Full stack trace
	* Relevant environment information
	* Identification of process, thread, class, method
	* Arbitrary information the developer thinks is useful
	* ''what else?''

Plenty of other platforms could do worse than recreate Un*x CoreFiles.

I can't believe how many people throw exceptions without even an explanatory
string. Do they really believe a class name explains something?

On C3, when we get an exception in production, we beep production support. Their text-enabled beepers get the walkback stack as part of the message. This often lets them prepare for the inevitable phone call, determine whether they need to come in, and so on. We also beep less violent events, such as key milestones completing in the production process. --RonJeffries
