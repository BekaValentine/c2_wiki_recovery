WikiPageBackup

If there is no version history, why not try
'''freezing WikiPage''''''s on the Website of the caring WikiAuthor''' ?
* Advantages of a WikiPageBackupOnTheWeb:
** Content is searchable via Websearch engines
** Webarchives like 
*** http://www.alexa.com 
** are taking backups, that can be retrieved, even if the Website of the WikiAuthor has diminished into thin air
* I just found HistoryPages
