This is the introductory paper by R. Milner on pi-calculus:

The page has also a link to the companion paper which goes deeper into theory.

I was hoping to find a nice, easy intro to this here, but alas not. All I've got so far is this:

http://www-ics.ee.ic.ac.uk/~frank/surp98/report/gdj1/pi-calculus.html

and a pdf of a paper on the Polyadic Pi calculus, but it looks a bit heavy going...

''I highly recommend RobinMilner's book, "Communicating and Mobile Systems: the Pi-Calculus", ISBN 0521658691.''

Thanks - it's certainly well written, though the maths is pretty hard. ''I just came across this page again while searching for a link for the book as the joint-scariest on my bookshelf, alongside DougLea's "Concurrent Programming in Java"''

-----
Comparable to the LambdaCalculus but where that is based on Functions, PiCalculus is based on Processes and arose from modelling Mobile systems. Many strange connectives, example: 
   
  /\/-> (like a crooked arrow) 
----
It can be used to specify languages similar to how LambdaCalculus is used in DenotationalSemantics - example with PrologLanguage:

----
A DenotationalSemantics of PiCalculus itself is given in http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.23.1179. 

A programming language based on it is PictLanguage.
