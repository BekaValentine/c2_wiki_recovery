Writer. Most famous for the novella ''BreakfastAtTiffanys'' (ISBN 0679745653), though my favorite work of his is ''InColdBlood'' (ISBN 0679745580); the prototypical TrueCrime novel, and more importantly, the first major piece of journalism with a novelistic narrative. Capote spent six years in and around Garden City, KS interviewing townspeople, detectives, and the perpetrators themselves researching for this book, which covers the Clutter case, a shockingly brutal and motiveless multiple homocide in a sleepy town in rural Holcomb Kansas. ''Definitely. I had no idea who TC was (still don't), but InColdBlood made my blood run cold at the end when the actual killer turned out to be the one most similar to my roommate. -- PhlIp''
