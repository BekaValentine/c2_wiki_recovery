InterTwingle is similar to the XanaduProject because they're both based on the philosophy that links between things are sometimes as important as, if not more important than, the things themselves. With Xanadu, the things were documents, whereas with the original InterTwingle idea, the things are people and email messages.

Etymological speculation: "intertwingle" seems like an intertwingling of "intermingle" and "intertwine".

Why not ExtremeIntertwingling ?

The original article by JamieZawinski http://www.mozilla.org/blue-sky/misc/199805/intertwingle.html and a specification document for an attempt to implement the idea http://cs.eou.edu/~pandora/spec1.html (''BrokenLink - 2004/01/28''; text is at http://web.archive.org/web/20010826193307/http://cs.eou.edu/~pandora/spec1.html, but images on that page are missing).

There might also be a mapping between this idea and GraphTheory since representing intertwingled information would require some kind of unweighted undirected graph. I wonder what kind of data structures would be needed to represent this? -- AdewaleOshineye

Ted Nelson coined the term "intertwingle" as a kind of synonym for "intermingle" but on steroids, and was fond of the phrase "everything is deeply intertwingled" e.g. in his influential double book "Computer Lib"/"Dream Machines".
