Is this a synonym with ObjectRelationalMapping? See NetworkDatabase. 

Is Network really inherently inferior in all cases? Take a look at, the example queries in ConceptualQueries, they seem to navigate a network of relationships, and they do not care about the implementation details (RelationalModel primary keys and foreign keys) they only care about the relationship.

Are ConceptualQueries a return to the NetworkModel? or is the NetworkModel a higher level view of relational? (In a network model (or with an ObjectRelationalMapper) you do not care about how a relationship is configured (you can write queries without worrying about the number of foreing key fields that need to match, you just ask for the "Employee that lives in a City", if the City has a primary key composed of 5 fields, you dont care, you only care about the conceptual "lives in" relationship) If the ObjectRelationalMapper (NetworkModelMapper? ConceptualModelMapper?) is well desinged you do not even care about the multiplicity relationship (you dont have to alter your query if you are asked to allow the Employees to live in many cities)
