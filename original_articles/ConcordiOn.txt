Concordion is an open source Java testing tool similar to FitForDevelopingSoftware. 

The biggest difference is the way the documents are linked to the code. Concordion uses explicit method calls hidden in attributes in the HTML source, whereas Fit uses implicit bindings based on table layouts.

The upshot is that Concordion's fixture code is much simpler than Fit's and Concordion specifications can be written in plain English paragraphs. It doesn't force you to put everything into tables the way Fit does. This can make for much more readable documents.

However, Concordion requires that the input document is written in HTML (to support the hidden attributes) whereas Fit documents can be written in other table-based formats (e.g. Excel).
