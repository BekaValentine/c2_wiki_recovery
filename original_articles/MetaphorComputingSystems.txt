Wow Metaphor.  That brings back great memories.  I had a Mac SE and an IBM AT (running Metaphor) on my desk at Procter & Gamble in 1991-1993.  The Metaphor hands-down was a faster data analyser.  However the Mac wins for functionality (the need for more than text and calc).

If anyone has pictures of the GUI, I'd love to see them.  Send me a line to argonaut10 at yahoo dot com

Metaphor became IBM's DIS then IDS and now the current version under windows is Meta5.

You can see a pic of the current GUI there www dot meta5 dot com  you can also forward any product questions to info at meta5 dot com

BTW it was called Metaphor Computer Systems not MetaphorComputingSystems

Metaphor founders were Don Massaro and David Liddle, Charles Irby was VP of development.  Metaphor helped IBM develop the user interface for OS2.  Before IBM got into it, Metaphor build their own hardware, desktop system, file servers, database servers & communications servers.
