IntraBroker is one of the WikiLikeThing''''''s and NonPublicWikiEngines. It is a commercial software from MindBroker based on an implementation with
JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition (using ModelViewController, JavaServerPages, JavaDatabaseConnectivity and TagLibs).

Currently it supports:

* separate user groups and PrivateWikiForums
* LinkNameIsPageName
* RecentChanges
* alphabetical index of all page names
* tracking of page usage and page navigation (similar to EveryThing)
* RealTime statistics
* RandomPages
* RichSiteSummary

On the ToDoList is ReverseIndex and PageChangeNotification.

Currently IntraBroker does not support:
* ReverseIndex
* WikiNames (instead it uses FreeLink).
* ContentEditableByAll (instead it supports NonPublicWikiForums)

IntraBroker is intended as a J2EE Module for EnterpriseApplicationIntegration. It requires EnterpriseJavaBeansServers and a RelationalDatabase.

The ProjectCodeName was MindPaths.

It is currently used as a DogFood CorporateWiki inside MindBroker.
