FabriceBellard's TinyCeeCompiler is at  http://tinycc.org/ ( http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/tcc ) - it is a very small and very fast CeeLanguage compiler which can either be used from the command line, or embedded as libtcc in an application so that it can be used to compile CeeLanguage code for delayed or immediate execution. 

A DeeLanguage interface to libtcc is included in the LanguageMachine, where there is a proof-of-concept implementation of a calculator ruleset in which each expression is translated to CeeLanguage code, compiled by libtcc and immediately executed to give a result.

Apparently FabriceBellard wrote a boostrap loader for the LinuxKernel which compiles the kernel from source as part of the loading process as a way of demonstrating that the compiler is pretty fast, and that it can deal with the kind of GnuCee that is used in the LinuxKernel
