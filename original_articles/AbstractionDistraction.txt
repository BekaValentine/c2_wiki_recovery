AbstractionDistraction code smell is when the code contains multiple abstraction levels mixed.

It is usually resolved by extract-method on the lower level code and give it a good name.

Terry Yin came up with a good example of AbstractionDistraction: "Tom married Jill and then he had a cup of tea."
