''A computer retained for operations for reasons other than current technology.'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110919
----
Some people, including myself, like to keep computers they have used far beyond their most useful and efficient lifetimes. They retain OperatingSystems, Programs and Data which have been made a legacy.

These are Computers which are still fully operational and function as they did 5, 10, 20, and even over 30 years ago.

I guess among other names, you might call those who have them Computer Collectors, or Historic Computer Preservationists.

There is a MarginalValue in the present time for keeping such computers in addition to their Historic Interest.
