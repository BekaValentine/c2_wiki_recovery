WebTV was an InternetServiceProvider.  Its clients accessed the internet through television SetTopBox''''''es.  The service was fairly common in the mid-1990s.  Some web pages are still designed to be viewable in WebTV's browser.  The browser was optimized for standard television's display area, so it did worked best for pages less than 550 pixels wide.  Wider images were often shrunk to fit, (perhaps at the provider level to save download bandwidth).
