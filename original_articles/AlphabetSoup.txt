We used to exchange media on tapes, records, and disks.  Now we use CD's, CD-ROM's, and DVD's.  Notice the apostrophes, which are proper for pluralizing alphabet soup, but I fear this helps encourage people to use them in other inappropriate place's.  I suppose we still need the acronyms to distinguish CD's from DVD's, but I wish we'd taken the 80's approach so that we could call DVD's "double-density disks".

Why are the apostrophes ''appropriate''? They seem unnecessary.

''Apostrophes are acceptable for acronyms, according to most authorities I'm aware of.''
