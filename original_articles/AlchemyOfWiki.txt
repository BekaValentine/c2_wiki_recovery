For the wiki to grow and stay healthy, it may be interesting to note that all four elements from Alchemy must be present.

* '''Earth:''' the wiki corpus, put into textual form.
* '''Sun:''' the eyes gazing upon the wiki, giving it attention.
* '''Air''': the invisible server on which wiki rests, available at all points. ''- available from the "ether" (net), you might say?''
* '''Water''': the interactions from WikiCommunity, making it grow.

When all four are present, the wiki can turn into a "TreeOfLife".
