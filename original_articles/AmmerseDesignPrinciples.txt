A set of 7 high level principles for Designing more malleable object oriented systems.
The 7 principles are meant to link to Design Patterns as a solution to each particular problem, but by the identification of the 7 concerns within design and implementing an Agile system. It is a high level approach where SCRUM, SOLID and other heuristics, principles, methods and patterns are combined within these 7 concerns.

The 7 concerns/principles are 
* Agile Design
* Minimal Design
* Maintainable Design
* Environmental Design
* Reachable Design
* Solving Design 
* Extensible Design.
