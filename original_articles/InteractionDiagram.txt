UnifiedModelingLanguage (UML) diagrams that show the interaction of object instances over time.
Two forms for the same data:
	1. SequenceDiagram (Wiki MessageSequenceChart) -- emphasizes the flow of time; what messages are sent in what sequence.
	2. CollaborationDiagram -- emphasizes the relationships between objects.  Clusters of arrows show heavy communication between instances.  Shows "spatial" relationships between objects, much like a class diagram.
