Stamp Collectors collect specific examples. When asked to solve a problem, they try to find the closest match. They then use that example as a template for the correct course of action. Contrast ModelMaker.

Stamp Collectors don't want to know why you push in the clutch when changing gears in a stick-shift car.

No, not the guy who likes collecting stamps.

Stamp Collecting is a frame of thought where one is primarily interested in 'simple' answers to questions (i.e., How do you do <foo>?  Step 1: ... Step 2: ..., etc...), and not the underlying reasons, forces, etc.  

When faced with flaws, Stamp Collectors prefer to patch symptoms,
rather than continually refactor designs.

The interest in underlying reasons and forces vs. requiring 'simple' steps seems to be the main difference between Stamp Collectors and PeopleWhoLikePatterns.
