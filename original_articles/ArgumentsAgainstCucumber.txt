'''Summary of Criticisms Against Cucumber'''

In the same vein as ArgumentsAgainstOop, let's raise and hash criticisms against the CucumberFramework. (and, by association, friends like LettuceFramework)

Note that not every critic will agree with all of these, nor will all proponents agree with all the characterizations given here.

* '''English as a programming language'''
* '''Overhead when the whole team isn't involved'''
* '''Given-When-Then form hides dependencies'''

As CucumberFramework (and http://cukes.info/), the stated goals are:

* Lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text.
* The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format.
