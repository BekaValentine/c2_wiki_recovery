Maintains a blog where you can learn more about him: Sample entry for April 16, 2005:
* Karen Schneider, the Freerange Librarian, has an article in the Library Journal on the ethics of librarian blogs that begins promisingly: "Blogging is turning information into a conversation..." And, it continues just as well, explaining the ethics and ethos of blogging in what she calls the "biblioblogosphere." She recommends transparency, linking to sites with which you disagree, being accurate even postponing pressing the Publish button until you're sure, a pretty drastic step for some of us and admitting your mistakes.

Sounds like good advice for WikiZens before pressing the "Save" button.
