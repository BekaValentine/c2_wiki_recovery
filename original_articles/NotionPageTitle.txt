--- '''How I handle this'''
I give the notion a page-name, and insert that name within a page which will link to it:
* cooperativeMinds in CollectiveIntelligence
* Or I insert it on my HomePage in the section containing created-pages, to give the notion a place-of-remembrance while not utilizing its wiki-link-form, CooperativeMinds
** then when I have composed and saved CooperativeMinds page in the wiki, I make the NotionPageTitle a WikiLink
--- '''Try this sometime when you have a notion for a WikiPage and links to it you do not want to forget'''
