''(I'm going to do just that. If anyone cares, they'll format it.)''

-----

Sometimes the situation is so bad that you don't see what's to salvage. You want to be nice and praise the good, but your critical parent just can't find any. 

	'''Bad solution:''':	Walk away and hope the problem will improve. Make yourself unavailable or gruff to the team until something goes right.

	'''Result:''':	You are now in denial, which is comfortable.

	'''Worse solution:''':	You storm in, make a big fuss, leave no room for comment, perhaps fire a ScapeGoat, and storm off.

	'''Worse result:''':	You are now deluded into believing that things may improve.

	'''Better:''':	Tackle one problem at a time. Be specific, calm, and avoid the words "you" and "I". Recognize that dysfunction extends deep into the environment. Watch your people. They may be suffering from UnclearGoals, ConflictingGoals, or other project maladies. A counterproductive appearance often stems from unclear communication. It may also be caused by "DelegateAndForget", or the assignment of tasks rather than problems. Perhaps the most demoralizing phrase is "Do it my way".

''And always ask yourself, "what role did I play in creating the problem in the first place?''
