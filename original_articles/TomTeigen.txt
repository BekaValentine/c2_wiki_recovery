I'm a Systems Analyst for Computer Sciences Corp. in Fort Worth TX.  Somewhat new to OO and patterns, my first exposure to it came from attending a Java seminar where Ward Cunningham gave a talk about new patterns for a new language.  Ward included a class exercise to write patterns that attendees have identified in their work.  I didn't have one that day, but I have since had a chance to think about it and have come up with the YingAndYang pattern.
