If WardsWiki was a business, it would not survive if it failed to produce value. Therefore it makes sense to talk about CtwoBusinessValue.

'''Things to consider'''


''Ask not what the Wiki can do for you, ask what you can do for the Wiki.'' -- MicrosoftSlave

''WhoIsTheCustomer''

* The WikiReader. Actually the question should be who are the customers ? But the most important is arguably this one.

''CustomerRelationshipManagement''

* It is currently lacking now. It would be interesting if WardCunningham would provide some statistics to give us an overview of approximately how many readers are there, how many active contributors, and so on. Other than that we can conduct informal surveys amongst ourselves.
