I have never seen this first hand in the RealWorld (this blog post http://www.ajantonov.com/2010/04/29/the-new-fashion-pair-management/ mentions an article by Michael Feathers, but that article seems to not be available anymore) , but I was wondering:

What if 2 managers, with the same degree of power, were to manage 1 developer team. They help each other understand the decisions they need to make from different angles, and the extra pair of eyes makes it easier to find risks & mitigate them.. and the practice could help keep the management pair focused...

I think that like it is mentioned in BasketballMetaphor, when you manage in a pair, one person could stay focused on the low-level, and the other on the high-level. Each person could be sharing experiences and experiments with each other. Having managed some software projects I think it would be helpful... I have solved a lot of problems by simply talking with other people... would making them full time managers as me be a waste? Or would it actually improve output and make things work better?

Would it be true that 2 managers are more than twice as productive as one for a given task?
