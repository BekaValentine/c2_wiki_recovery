'''Popular''''''Science''' is the term used to talk about science bundled for presentation to the public. There are many of these given in the UK, see http://www.simonsingh.com or http://www.mathsinspiration.com for examples. The speakers (including myself) are often subversives - their objective is to instill in an unsuspecting audience an appreciation of the methods and processes in science, but it's disguised under a veneer of street theater style entertainment.
