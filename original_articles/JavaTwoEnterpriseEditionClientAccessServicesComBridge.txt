'''UseByDateException. Cannot find CAS on developer.java.sun site (Sep04).''' 
* Maybe JavaNativeInterface (JNI) is the equivalent. Some mention of it in this page as well(JNI ref at http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jni/spec/intro.html).

A bridge produced by J''''''avaSoft that allows COM enabled client software to access Java objects as COM objects through an IDispatch interface. You can download an early access version of the software here: http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/j2eecas/

The API is very simple and will become simpler. There is built-in support for accessing JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition servers and talking to EnterpriseJavaBeans. -- PhilGoodwin

From a quick and informal glance over the ComToJavaBridges out there, I got the impression that Linar's J-Integra (http://www.linar.com/) could also access custom COM interfaces, incredible as it may sound. I might be mistaken, however.

''I used J-Integra to access the MSFT media encoder from a java application. Basically, if you have a typelib or some way to get the interfaces for a COM object then J-Integra can generate the bridge classes. Note that by default it uses DCOM, meaning you could have your Java app running on any platform with a supported JVM and access COM services on a windows machine. The most recent version includes a Java-to-Native DLL which allows direct COM access. It works pretty well. -- StevenNewton''

	* Will there be any plans for J2EE CAS to support custom interfaces? Is this even possible, or should we just give up hoping?

	* What will the pricing/licensing scheme for J2EE CAS be?

	* How does J2EE CAS compare to other ComToJavaBridges like J-Integra, IBM's OLEBridge, the open source JACOB?

	* Is J2EE CAS a reaction to the threat of MicrosoftDotNet? ''no''

----
Is there a more light-weight ''just'' COM/RMI bridge?
----
Are there any SunJava compatible packages for reading/writing to the Window's Registry?

----

The above question could be rephrased as 'Are there any COM objects for reading/writing to the Window's Registry?'?

(Hint: there are. Have a hunt around on http://msdn.microsoft.com.)

Then add J-Integra or PhilGoodwin's stuff and hey presto! Instant registry access.

This of course raises the question: If Ja''''''vaSoft are now producing an easy-to-use bridge to native code, why did Sun raise such a fuss about J/Direct?

-- DanielEarwicker

Sun certainly raised a fuss, but I don't believe they ever complained about J/Direct. A press release describing Sun's suit against Microsoft can be found at http://www.sun.com/announcement/. Note that the press release makes absolutely no mention of J/Direct or Java/COM. Sun most definitely did want Microsoft to support JNI, and in fact Microsoft ultimately had to in response to a court order (see http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-337703.html). On the other hand, they did not have to remove J/Direct and Java/COM.

-- CurtisBartley

Bull. I don't care what the press release says. I know people that were involved in the direct negotiations and Sun would NOT allow COM support in Java which MicroSoft offered to Sun FOR FREE. They also were incensed about J/Direct. They made their bed. Now they live in it. If they had LET MicroSoft participate in the Java process like every other company their WOULD NOT BE A DotNet. Now we will see DotNet crush them and I'll be the first one cheering.

There's a difference between making COM a part of the Java standard and Sun allowing Microsoft to provide COM support in the MS JVM as an extension above and beyond the Java standard. The press release seems to imply that Sun would have allowed the latter even if they outright rejected adopting COM as part of the standard as Sam says. Of course, maybe Sun really was trying to force MS to remove J/Direct and Java/COM from their JVM. All I'm saying is that Sun never said that publicly. So to get back to the original point, Sun's current effort to provide COM support is not an about-face from what they've said publicly, even if it is an about-face from what Sun told Microsoft privately (as it appears to me, anyway).
