Does someone know a distributed collection of Wikis, where the pages of each wiki are replaced by map views (similar to GoogleEarth with panning, zooming etc.), based on OpenSource? -- FridemarPache

To wikify it, we need to allow the texts in the nodes and annotations containing wiki words that link as usually to existing or empty pages. The current edit procedure of the CMAPS appears to me not userfriendly enough (when not enriched
with wiki intelligence :-)
