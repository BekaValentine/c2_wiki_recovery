The PragmaticMethodologist doesn't exist. Pragmatic means a willingness to deal with things as they are, not as they should be. And when did you see that in a methodologist? ''(the last time I saw AlistairCockburn work)''

To be fair, many consultants are such methodologists. They know lots of ways that work but hold their tongues until they understand the client's situation. Then they offer the one or two things that will most improve the situation and stay around long enough to make sure the ideas stick. JerryWeinberg is a good example, contract programmers probably aren't.
