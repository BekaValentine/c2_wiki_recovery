MonkeyWiki is a WikiEngine written in the PythonLanguage by BarnabyScott.

Why does the world need ''another'' WikiEngine? Well, maybe it doesn't, but I couldn't find one that fitted what I wanted to achieve with a website I run (http://www.designermakers.org.uk), so I thought I would write one myself.

'''So here are some of the features that I tried to build in:'''

*Can use templates to give total control of the way the pages look. Unlimited templates for different pages or actions. Template tags capable of including other pages or arbitrary content.
*Can use Rewrite, so that URLs look clean and like a normal website.
*Can cache HTML pages so that normal viewing is speeded up
*Minimal disk usage by sending backups to the wikimaster by email.
*Suitable for, and easy to install on a rented virtual server.
*Small (single file) and simple to maintain/improve.
*Easy to run within a simple wrapper to add such things as access control
*Minimal, intuitive mark-up suited to a non-technical audience (e.g. line-breaks ''are'' honoured). 

'''Acknowledgements:'''
*First and foremost to PikiPiki, a wiki engine by MartinPool. This was a big inspiration, and my Wiki''''''Parser is a very recognisable descendant.
*The good people on the ''tutor'' mailing list at ''python.org'', for their help on various occasions.

(Not to be confused with InfiniteMonkey.)
