"I'm a software engineer at Corning Incorporated, currently a longtime WikiLurker."

No longer accurate.  I'm still a lurker, but not with Corning.  
As a former "victim" of the economy, I'm now a software developer for ConfigureSoft in beautiful Woodland Park, Colorado.  Now that I'm out of job hunting mode, I plan to become more active - in my lurking, for now.
