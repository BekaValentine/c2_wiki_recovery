The '''quantum sea''' is that non-place out in the boundless where all life originated.  It is a place of ''unknowability''.  As the casimir effect has shown, the emptiness of the boundless is not merely ''nothingness'', it is a constantly dynamic medium (or field) which is outside any idea of time or distance.  Of any concept of ''measureablility''.  A field of irrationality, but from which an accidental ''replicator'' (cf. RichardDawkins) emerged to start the process of all life.

One can find evidence for such with the Casimir effect:  the background pressure that had been observed (to preserve Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) between two plates.  One can exploit this to create "Casimir tuners" and the ability to communicate across any distance via QuantumResonance.

Such concept were pivotal in the development of the PangaiaProject.
