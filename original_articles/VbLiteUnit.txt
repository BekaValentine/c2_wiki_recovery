Vb Lite Unit is SteveJorgensen's solution to the state of unit testing software for classic VB/VBA. Unlike some other unit testing systems for VB/VBA, VB Lite Unit...

1. is Open Source. If there's something you need to improve, you can do it.

2. is free of charge. Install anywhere, any time, with no license hassles.

3. does not rely on introspection techniques that only work in the full VB6 IDE.

4. does not require the annoying and error prone maintenance of a list of test procedures in each test case class separate from the tests themselves.

5. is actively maintained (at least as of today, Aug 11, 2004).
