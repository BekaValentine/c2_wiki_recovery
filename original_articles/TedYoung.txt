Ted M. Young (the M is for Montgomery, but don't ask why, even Ted's parents no longer know the reason!) is a Quality Software Guy. For years, he's been trying to inject quality into the development of software, not always with good results, e.g., "Who needs quality? Ship the software now!"

Ted's also a Java Author (who's written lots of training courses and a bunch of newsletters and columns hither and yon), Consultant, Mentor (mentoring is preferable to being a warm body writing code, but ExtremeProgramming is a great way of combining the two), and Trainer (nothing better than standing in front of a crowd and helping them learn - and Ted used to be afraid of public speaking!).

As of April 2001, he is once again independent, living with his wife in the San Francisco Bay area after working for a software company in NYC where the critical mass necessary for ExtremeProgramming never happened - though we did use some of the core techniques.

As of December 2002, I joined eBay and found (along with others) that it's not an appropriate environment for XP or any Agile methodology as product development is, at its core, completely planned up front.

Therefore, as of September 2005, I have joined Google in the hopes that its environment is more conducive to the Agile Way.


Ted loves to listen to music of all kinds and make music (usually Rush) on the guitar and is awaiting the day when he can turn his Marshall amp up past 1 1/2 without bothering anyone. He also is an avid rock-climber, looking forward to the days when the weather and time allow him to move past a 5.9.

''Surely a true music-lover wouldn't want to risk damaging his hearing by use of high volume.''

- Setting the volume to 2 is certainly not a high volume. 1.5 is so low, that you don't get that great "overloaded" sound.

Ted can be contacted at [firstname][lastname]atgmail.com.  You can also find him on the XpMailingList (among others), and now at the BayAreaXpUsersGroup meetings.
