	 :	The very fact that he doesn't distinguish between interaction design and methodology of interaction design is evidence that he doesn't do interaction design.

Isn't it rather the other way around? He has been working with this in the field for years, and has summarized his practical knowledge in his books, without being very strict about drawing lines between theory and practice, which a real methodologist would.

''Actually, AlanCooper doesn't even see himself as a designer. He sees himself as an inventor and CooperInteractionDesign is just one more of his inventions. Cooper's work "in the field" was managing a group of designers, not doing design work.''
