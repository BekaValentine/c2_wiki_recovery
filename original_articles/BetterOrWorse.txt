How does a software developer, or computer scientist, tell if one result is better or worse than another result?  When is such judgement important?

	* WorseIsBetter
	* ComplexIsBetter
	* UseJudgementNotProofs
	* QualityVsPrescriptionRules
	* WorstThingsFirst
	* relativism: GettingBetter
	* to make it even more complicated, some things GetWorseBeforeBetter
