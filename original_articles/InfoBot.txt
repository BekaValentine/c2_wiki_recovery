An InfoBot listens on an InternetRelayChat (IRC) channel and offers information when asked (and sometimes when not asked). An exemplar is "purl", the infobot for the efnet #perl channel. Purl knows how to search the Perl documentation, can perform simple Google searches, and offers up canned responses to frequent questions.
