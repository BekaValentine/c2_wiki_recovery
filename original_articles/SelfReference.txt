SelfReference is a strange thing. 
Some examples:
	* The descriptions of the tables of a RelationalDatabase are themselves stored in a table.
	* The descriptions of classes in languages like SmalltalkLanguage or JavaLanguage are instances of themselves.
	* Software companies are using DogFood.

So SelfReference is something which goes across the boundaries of distinctions. 
(table vs row, class vs instance, developer vs customer).
