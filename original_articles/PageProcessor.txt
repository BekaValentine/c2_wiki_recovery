When using unique methods such as the one spelled out in SpecialLinkingPresentationFormat, provisions are necessary. Using HyperTags in a local processing application (I use NysInfo) and SpecialLinks called ReachablePages, as well as SpecialActiveLinks (which may include processing via JavaScript or other like processing.

Examples of what is meant can be seen in such PageProcessor''''''s as TiddlyWiki, where the page includes things to be displayed, as well as the methods to display them. TiddlyWiki uses JavaScript, but the processing can utilize other methods which include local processes as well as EmbeddedProcesses.

But PageProcessor''''''s can include such things as archiving, compression, distribution via syndication and other methods, and LinksDetectionAndVerification, and others. What I would like to see a PageProcessor do is to integrate, specify and coordinate the information on a page using local, regional, national, and international features in a standardized VisualMarkUpLanguage (VMUL). It would use visual and iconic symbology to construct pages, and would not require a steep learning curve to use. The user would drag and drop into the page at marked places the visual or iconic symbol to create the desired feature. Features could include links, BackLinks, FirstPreviousNextAndLast, Photos and Media embeds, GeoLinks, and other created StandardizedLinkingProcesses represented by, inserted by, and processed by use of the DragAndDroppable VisualSymbolOrIcon.
