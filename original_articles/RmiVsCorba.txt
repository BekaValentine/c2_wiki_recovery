JavaRemoteMethodInvocation and CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture share a great deal in common.  The main difference is that RMI stubs must interface to a Java interface, while CORBA stubs interface to a special interface language called InterfaceDefinitionLanguage.  There's a lot more to it than just this, of course.
