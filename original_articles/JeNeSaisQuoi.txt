French for QualityWithoutaName.

French for "I don't know what." A phrase most of us might usefully employ more often than we in fact do.

An approximate pronunciation for English speakers is "zhun say kwah".

''I'm not sure this is a good translation. It lacks a certain eastern je ne sais quoi which QWAN definitely conveys. I'm deeply grateful however, for being reminded of a phrase I could use as a passable substitute for QWAN in my own language. -- LaurentBossavit''

English equivalent:  "that certain, special something"
