First, let's link the famous HelloWorld, so I have a link to some other page in this wiki.

Now some background information about me. My personal website is at http://www.peruzzo.org/ in Portuguese, http://www.fabricioperuzzo.com/ in english.

I also maintain the Moeda Corrente Informative at http://www.moedacorrente.com.br/ This one is written in Portuguese, my mother language, sorry english speakers.

I am a computer scientist who loves to learn new things. The entire wiki concept, I learned here, way before the Wikipedia became what it is now. 

Go to the FrontPage to know what is a wiki and learn about the first one to be created.
