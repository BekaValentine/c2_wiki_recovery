I'm a computer programmer and have been since I graduated from CarnegieMellonUniversity, where I met a number of really interesting people and learned a lot of interesting stuff which I have since forgotten. I then went into programming in VisualBasic, got LaidOff, learned DotNet, and since then have been stuffing all sorts of computing stuff into my head.

I'm interested in learning more about Patterns and other parts of ObjectOrientedProgramming, which is how I found this. Recently I've been learning more about TestDrivenDevelopment and UnitTests. I think they are quite keen.

My current project is to create a program to allow me to better run conventions. Work continues slowly.
