The 'FreeVote.com' site is now gone.  It is a seroius, real shame.

'FreeVote' isn't working at the moment.  It hasn't been for over a month now. The main pages are up and running.  However, ALL BOOTHS have been deleted.  All booth owners have lost their booth(s) for good.  Even those who had been updating their booths regularly. ALL CATEGORIES have been deleted.  The 'Freevote.com' site will NOT ALLOW ANYONE to create a booth.  Anyone wanting to send the 'FreeVote.com' staff an e-mail at:  http://www.freevote.com/support.bml  will find that it doesn't go through.  The 'Latest News' page of 'FreeVote.com' at :   http://www.freevote.com/news.bml  has not been updated since 07/29/2002.  'FreeVote.com' was an excellent site, back in the day.  Now it's just a waste of space.  It should either be fixed up, sold on 'E-Bay' or shut down.
