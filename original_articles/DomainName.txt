DomainName in a strict sense is that part of an internet domain, which comes right left after the dot left to the TopLevelDomain up to the next dot, if any.

* In a given URL http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DomainName the TLD is 'com' and the DomainName is c2.com denoting the server called c2 within the domain of .com
* If there would be a www.c2.com than www would be that server that handles HTTP-requests on the c2.com domain
* In a given e-mail address superuser@c2.com, the DomainName of that e-mail adress is c2.com
