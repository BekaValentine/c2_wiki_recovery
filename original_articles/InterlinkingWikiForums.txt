Interlinking contributions in different WikiForum''''s helps to grow and differentiate all involved collaboration places. 

Before a working InterWiki, I think it is a good idea to incorporate WikiForumPrefixes as abbreviations in the WikiEngines, like done in MeatballWiki. (Of course not hardwired, but in a public available configuration file, that can be updated from WikiForumPrefixes).

To link from Meatball to WardsWiki is done like this: 

"Wiki:WikiName". 

Concerning the other direction, what about

"Meatball:WikiName"

instead of having to write the ugly reference:

http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiName

The feature in MeatballWiki is inherited from UseModWiki. Let's ignore the namespace mangling which doesn't flow in good English. e.g. "That's far too complex. You should Wiki:DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork." Read that out loud...

On a related note, some people may be wondering why I keep writing "MeatballWiki" around a link to usemod.com. That's because the URL to MeatballWiki may change in the future and I'd like to be able to find all references to it and change them. This would naturally be easier with one level of indirection (as we all know), but that isn't feasible. Hey, and use MeaningfulName''''''s! ''Meatball'':WikiName, dammit! -- SunirShah

Sunir, in keeping with your wish to have people use Meatball instead of Meat, I suggest you have Meatball's references to Ward's WikiWikiWeb say Wikiwiki instead of just Wiki.  The reason is that he keeps reminding us that this is "wikiwiki", which is a phrase in Hawaiian.  People there don't going around saying "wiki", they go around saying "wiki wiki".  So chopping off the second wiki damages the allusion and also counters Ward's explicit request.  Cheers - AlistairCockburn

As we discussed in an e-mail (~April 2000), Ward has stated otherwise. -- SunirShah
