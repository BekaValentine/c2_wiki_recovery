The act or process of producing a DomainModel.

-- NickRobinson.

If you know what a domain is  . . .


I still cannot come to a conclusion.  Is the method of using Domain Models as data holders making sense.  From my recollection, when I have to come up with a Domain Model, I was taught to gather all the nouns possible and define their attributes.  By coming up with such a domain model, it tends to be pure data holders.  I am a little inexperienced in this area.  Any help in helping me understand is appreciated.
