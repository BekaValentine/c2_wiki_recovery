Milestones are a well known project management technique for judging progress. If you find yourself having to estimate partial task completion (see PercentCompletedMyth), consider using InchPebbles - i.e. fine grained milestones, so that you're always reporting another inch pebble achieved, rather than a task 67.5% complete.
