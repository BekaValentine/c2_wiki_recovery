Rather than addressing the unknown, FearOfTheUnknown is often the result of focusing on the fear.

It is normal to question new practices.

In software development, often a quick experiment would change the fear into a solvable known quantity almost immediately.

Sometimes the fear is rational, sometimes not. FearOfTheUnknown often manifests as paralysis.

Rather than taking a look at what is actually causing the fear, FearOfTheUnknown often results in IfItIsWorkingDontChange (See also IfItAintBrokeDontFixIt).

This is a TriteExpression.
