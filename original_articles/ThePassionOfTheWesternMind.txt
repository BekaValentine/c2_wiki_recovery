''The Passion of the Western Mind''
by Richard Tarnas [ISBN 0345368096]

A great book about the evolution of ideas through
Western civilization from the early Greeks through
the 20th century. An easy read. It flows well
through the centuries with the right amount of
detail for covering such a huge topic for people
with other things to do.
