''(The argument that "It's covered by the search engines listed there." would be a good argument.  Deleting all reference to BookAse from this Wiki would not be considered a good argument; it would be considered unsociable.)''

*Because: We like to list "known to us" businesses here on Wiki, and not just any-old-business.  Friends helping friends, and we do not know your business, so how can we recommend it to another?

''(It's not my company:  I had never heard of BookAse until I noticed them getting kicked from the WhereToBuyBooks page, and wanted to know why.)''

''I don't think we should exclude them just because they're in India.  We do have an international membership and audience.''

''On the other hand, I don't see a good reason to believe that this used book search service is any better than the others listed on WhereToBuyBooks.''

''On the positive side, a search on "bookase sucks" does '''not''' find any results critical of BookAse.''

''I think that their user interface is a bit nicer than the other WhereToBuyBooks search engines.  And they offer a WhereToSellBooks search feature, with suggested prices, which is nice -- but seems to be incomplete (IE: missing big commonly-used vendors).  And they're connected to a WhereToDonateBooks site, BetterWorldBooks.com (http://www.betterworldbooks.com/) -- JeffGrigg''

So, are we here to advertise any online bookstore, or is it all about recommending places that we have done good business with to other WikiUser''''''s?  What about it says that it offers something better for WikiUser''''''s, and who recommended it?  Why do we try so hard to keep out spam?  It looks to me like they came along and added themselves.

''True, but they did add their name in the right place -- which is a heck of a lot better than most spammers.  So it looks like we have '''one''' legitimate wiki user who likes them.  I think I'll try them next time I'm looking for a book, to see how they compare to the other search engines.''

''April 2010:  I used BookAse and the other search engines on WhereToBuyBooks to find a book.  I found BookAse competitive:  It has a better user interface, and no other search service had a better book price.  I bought the book through BookAse.  -- JeffGrigg''
