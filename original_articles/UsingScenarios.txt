Usefulness Of Scenarios

A scenario is not a factual representation, but a visualization of probable happenings, most often projected forward in time, but also is useful as a device projecting backward in time. No pretending of fact should be drawn from the use of a scenario as presenting what will, or what has happened, but rather based on what was known by the speculator both in fact and in inference from fact. It is a vehicle chosen to present likely outcomes, and though not perfect, can be a useful tool in coming to decisions (in the case of forward time scenarios), or in the formulation of theories and speculations. This method of presentation has been successfully used by many theorists and speculators. --DonaldNoyes 

An example of the use of scenarios can be found in presentations used to establish the general theory of evolution.
