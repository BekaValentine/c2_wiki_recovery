''The original aim: Develop schemes to utilize the notion: NotBuiltInOneDay''
----
---'''Process'''
* in creating models for Presentation and Preservation of Artifacts utilizing an archive which is constructed as a series of Portable Linkable Documents (PLDFs) developed from a root notion or  document of a notion, including first the root document, then adding subsequent levels. Contained within links in the local machine or available from it.
** the process can proceed through the next level of some or all of the derived documents, but if done, will greatly increase its size.
* While the project began on WardsWiki originally, it was quickly discovered, after only three days, that it would be better to locate the Portable Document elsewhere, since it grew to include other than WikiWiki root documents. 
** It is utilized in an ArtifactoryProcess, being included within other locally executed programs, mostly one called NysLte.
