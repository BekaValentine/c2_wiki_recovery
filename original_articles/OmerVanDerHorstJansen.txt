Hi! I'm Omer. I tend to have to spell my last name -- "Van der Horst Jansen" -- a lot. I am a native of the Netherlands, but live in beautiful Guilford, Vermont. 

I'm certified at CowboyCoding -- as I work at Holstein Association USA, where we store and process records on dozens of millions of Holstein cows.

As of mid-June 2000, my CowboyCoding days are officially over. I now work for Clickshare Service Corporation (http://www.clickshare.com). At Clickshare we are building a micropayment and user registration infrastructure. Clickshare's Worldwide Headquarters is located in Williamstown, Massachusetts, which is a lovely little college town in the Berkshires.

I can be contacted at omer@clickshare.com
