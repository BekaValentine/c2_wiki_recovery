I'm an employee of Wells Fargo, who attended XpImmersionTwo, interviewed at XpImmersionThree, coached at XpImmersionFour, and hung out on the evenings of XpImmersionFive.  I finally got KentBeck to see the OfficeSpaceMovie at XpImmersionSix (after listening to him recite ThePrincessBride).  I am the editor of junit.org and evangelist of JavaUnit, JakartaAnt, CruiseControl, HttpUnit, ApacheTomcat, and OpenSource in general.

Those NewToWiki DoNt KnowYourAudience like OldTimer''''''s.  Since WikiSuccessCanInhibitNewWriters, maybe we could AssumeStupidityNotMalice, yet remember DontAssumeStupidity?  Would it help if we tried to UseYourCommonSense, but when ItDoesntWork DontUseYourCommonSense ( DontDoThat )?  A WikiMaster can  ReFactor a PissTake into an EmotionalBurp without a SignificantEmotionalEvent.

	 :	If you don't FixYourWiki, you really have no right to piss and moan about WhyWikiWorksNot. If we all do our bit then the messes will be cleaned.
