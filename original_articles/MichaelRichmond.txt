I studied for my PhD at The Institute Formally Known As The Microsoft Research Institute (TIFKATMRI), a research centre previously situated on the campus of Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.

My PhD research is concerned with extending the EnterpriseJavaBeans architecture to support the relocation and rebinding of EJBs also known as migration).

During my graduate work I was supervised by JamesNoble. After which, he is planing a career in commercial research. (It's either that or going  back to working as a fish monger.)
