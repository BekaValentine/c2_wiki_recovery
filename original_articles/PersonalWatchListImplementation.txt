''Here are some ideas for implementing PersonalWatchList - This is an improvement over RecentChanges ''

'''Modified-list as a floating DIV'''

The modified-list could be easily accessible if it is implemented as a floating DIV on the left or right side of the window.  Since it has to be rendered for each page view, it is always relatively up to date.  You can see updates while you browse around.  With RecentChanges, you have to stop and go to a special page.

'''User Cookie'''

For ease of explaining the idea:
* PersonalWatchList refers to user accounts
* They are not actually necessary
* All that is needed is a "user cookie"  

Here is the idea for implementing it:
* When a new user comes to the site without a user cookie, one is automatically generated for them on the first page request
* The browser is given some ludicrously long storage time  
* The cookie just contains a serial number that represents the user's account
** The serial number is private, and the user should not normally see it or give it out to anyone else

When the user wants to share the same "account" between two computers:
* There can be a page somewhere that shows the user his current serial number, and lets him change it
* The user can write down the serial number from one computer and then transfer it to the other computer
* The two computers are now using the same "account"

This Wiki:
* The current user name cookie on this wiki doesn't use a serial number - it uses the user's WikiName
* It should be avoided in the Personal Watch List, since a miscreant could just "log in" using the User's Name and wreak havoc on that user's watch list
