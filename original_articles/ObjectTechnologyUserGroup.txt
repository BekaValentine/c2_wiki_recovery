ObjectTechnologyUserGroup was founded in 1991 by Tom Evans and has met monthly in various venues provided by the University of St. Thomas. ObjectTechnologyUserGroup exists to foster an environment for professional discussion and education in all aspects of object technology. Meetings are held on the third Tuesday of each month and are a mix of general and special interest discussion, panel sessions, and featured presentations. One need not be a member to attend a meeting, but members receive TheObjectTechnologyUsersGroup Connection, a monthly newsletter featuring meeting announcements,
columns, book reviews, and technical articles. 

Feature presentations are often given by vendors of object technologies. We welcome vendor-sponsored presentations that focus on a particular topic or problem of general interest with reference to how the vendor's product addresses that topic or problem. Marketing presentations are fine as long as you can back it up with some real technology.
