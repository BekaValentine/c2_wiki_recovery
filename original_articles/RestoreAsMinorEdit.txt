I noticed that a WikiGnome just restored a wipeout of CodeUnitTestFirst (ThankYou). Should that restoration be classified as a change, or as a minor edit? Arguments for each position:

'''Change'''

	* If the original deletion had shown up on RecentChanges, it's worth noting on RecentChanges that the file has been restored.
	* Marking a page restoration as a change might increase the chance that the WikiGnome who deleted it, will notice.
*Restoring a page is not minor.

'''Minor Edit'''

	* Marking a page restoration as a minor edit might decrease the chance that the vandal, ''if it '''was''' a vandal'' will notice.
	* Restoring a page adds nothing that wasn't there before, so it's not of interest to those tracking the page.

I suggest using RecentEdits for restores that are old deletions (scrolled off RecentChanges or vandalism), but using RecentChanges for restores of well-intentioned deletions that are still on the RecentChanges page.
