What an ethical person should say when they are approached with a suggestion to do something that is impossible, or is illegal, or not wise. This could be a programmer, an accountant, or even a CEO.

But when a person reaches a limit in terms of hours worked, tasks assigned, or in the performance of dubious or unethical matters, one should simply say "MyAnswerIsNo"
