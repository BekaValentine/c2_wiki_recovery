The code word mechanism has kept me from updating this page in years. It works for now so I will post some updates. Interestingly, googling myself still brings this page up highest, despite me also having a site with my name as its domain. I guess it takes C2s age and maturity to compete with the "other" Sven, who worked on imp.

For those who showed interest in the HtagLanguage, I woudl point you in the direction of ColdFusion. I recently had the displeasure on having to work with it, and found that HtagLanguage was not nearly as amateurish as I feared, but actually out-features and outperforms ColdFusion in many respects. I guess I should have perused the system more strongly in those early years. In the meantime I had to actually start rebuilding the original HtagLanguage app ( a local yellow pages directory created in 1999) as I seem to have lost the source code for the compiler and some of the early Htag scripts that were compiled. It seems to be one of those things one does not really expect to happen.

My email address is still relevant (killroy@gmail.com) and I hope in the future I will again be able to access this page.

OK, Implemented the Perl5 reExp for HtagLanguage. This brings HtagWiki up to date on the formatting, with several possible formattingRules. Please visit also my interpretation of the PhotoWiki http://photowiki.ywp.d2g.com

I've rewritten and decomposed the HtagWiki as far as is possible with the current HtagLanguage syntax. I found many deficits I've not encountered while using it as a simple dynamic website language. The lack of complex data types and local variables makes functional decomposition awkward and recursion ''extremely'' messy. Maybe now that I have regular expressions, rewriting the parser for more concise syntax would be much easier.

I hope soon the code will be more or less in a release state so I can start filling the HtagWiki pages at last.

I'll put in stuff here later if I feel it's of interest.

I've been developing a language I call HTAG (out of laziness) and basically I just make it do anything I want it to do.

For something written in HTAG, visit http://FoodForfun.com, and to see the project that included the very first versions of HTAG, visit http://GoldenPagesMalta.com. HTAG has recently found heavier applications, producing several megs of formatted code for 10s of 1000s of hits per day, including complex DB lookups and wiki-like formatting and autolinking of documents on http://Pharma-Help.com.

HtagWiki is currently not available. I want to fix it, I really do, but better don't hold your breath.

If anybody here is interested in compiler/interpreter writing and all that that entails, I'd love to meet some LikeMind''''''s.

Hi Sven. I posted the original version of [RethinkingCompilerDesign]. I see a convergence between interpreter and compiler technology. Also more sophisticated use of MetaData. Want to talk? -- JamesCrook

Wow, I've been gone for a long time. The shape of my work has changed, and I've been creating/administering and hosting my own sites for some time now. Sometimes I don't know if I drown more in code or in bits of networking hardware or servers, but it's exciting and challenging to work an all fronts.

I thought I write an update here as I've come full circle back to the WikiWorld again. some while ago I've FINALLY started using PHP and do not plan to write new software in HtagLanguage any more. I still have much code running in HtagLanguage though, and hope perhaps to write an interpreter in PHP some time. I found it interesting that I could continue writing in PHP without having ever toughed it before and with ZeroLearningCurve or even slowing down. I guess all programming languages are essentially the same (just as I believe all human languages are essentially the same since I started learning Japanese).

My renewed interest stems mainly from my recent work on processing some WikiPedia content (ok, all of it). I don't want to run a wiki, so I couldn't use their MediaWiki software. I started building a WikiEngine for their syntax from scratch and found quite a few complications compared to c2.com, such as the namespaces, categories, templates and recursive parsing. It's been really interesting and I would love to talk to anybody who has also worked with WikiPedia syntax outside of the WikiMedia software. Interestingly, they claim that you would need serious hardware to run the full database, but I've found that with some optimizations I can run the 2.2GB dataset just fine on my existing server. I'm going to open the flood gates on the load soon though, and then we'll see (I've preemptively ordered some hardware upgrades). -- SvenNeumann

Q: ''What language is used for the development of the HtagLanguage?''

A: HTAG is written primarily in Delphi, but is quite independent as it does not use the VCL and is relying on low level features only. One of my goals is to write a portable port in C of the HTAG Engine. Recently, I've added more language features, and more and more I am porting most parts of Htag into Htag. In fact I've started building other, simpler interpreters in HtagLanguage too. -- SvenNeumann

About your question with regular expressions for hyperlinks getting messed up: what I do is to take the text of the page, and split it into sections demarcated by the external links, then process each section, and merge them all back together. This way, the hyperlinks are unaffected by any text formatting rules.

Re wanting a regex that sees only wiki words not preceded by non-space characters: using python's re module, I do:
 (r'(?P<c>-|\b)(?P<a>([A-Z][a-z]+){2,})((?P<b>\[.*?\])|\b)')
where wiki words can additionally be escaped by prepending a hyphen and displayed by plain text if appended with text within square brackets. -- AndyPierce

A similar way to preserve hyperlinks in URLs is detailed on TextFormattingRegularExpressions. I've removed the A''''''nswerMe tag from the question there.
