Printx.Org Wiki is a modified PhpWiki with many enhancements and a nice new skin. We have localized and tuned all interfaces, put some security enhancements and full Java XML support as backend. It runs on Unix and Windows. A running release can be reached at http://www.codebock.com (BrokenLink)or http://www.printx.org

Download for PHP4/MySQL: http://www.codebock.de/content.zip (BrokenLink 2008-06-14)

We are now porting the whole work to java/xml... it'll be worth the wait...

Site seems to have moved. I get an error trying to download Printx.Org Wiki. www.printx.org seems to be the homepage of a shareware calender application.
