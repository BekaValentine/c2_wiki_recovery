A collection of 63 outdoor games. All games all described in a standard format.
Title, Summary (providing a vivid picture of what the games require the participants to do), Objectives, Materials, Timing, Procedure, Commentary and Variations.
Most games take between 15 minutes and an hour.
Objectives include things like creative problem solving, goal setting, customer service, cooperation versus competition.
For a lot of the games a scenario or fantasy is given that creates a fantasy environment for the game, and sets a dramatic context.

The book has good trainer guidelines, including hints for briefing and de briefing.
Some games can be done inside. The names are inviting.
I played some of them, tried some in workshops - they are fun.
