lit's GeekNight... pizza at 7, film at 11
Due to popular demand, particulary because people want to drink on thursday's we're going to try having it on Wednesday from now on. If this doesn't work,
we'll switch it back.

Agenda:
	*MarathonMan website == boring == no one ever wants to help me with it

Attendees (and pizza preference, and whether bringing laptop/notebook):
	*CharlesLowell will have my tosh 6100
