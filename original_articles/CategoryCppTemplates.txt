There seems to be enough discussion on this to warrant CategoryCppTemplates within CategoryCpp.

category: a division in a scheme of classification - Templates are clearly a division in a scheme of classification.

Must a category be so broad as to be practically useless? It seems that if there are at least a half dozen or so pages categorized under one category name, that sufficient reason for the category exists. It seems to me a category of from 6 to 20 pages is more useful than one which has several dozen to hundreds of categorized inclusions.
