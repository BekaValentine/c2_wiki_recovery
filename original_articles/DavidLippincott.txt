My professional career started in industrial control systems in waste fueled heat sources for industrial processes.  That is, we burned wood chips, tea leaves, corn cobs, sugar cane (for example) to provide the heat to dry the raw materials.

I founded Industrial Computer Source in 1985 as a catalog marketing company selling industrial computers into the light industrial control market, data acquisition, mobile computing, etc.  We were wildly successful and established many of the ground rules for industrial computers.

I have subsequently founded Chassis Plans at http://www.chassis-plans.com as a manufacturer of rackmount industrial computers, rack mount keyboard LCD display monitor drawers, single board computers and active / passive backplanes.

David, welcome to Wiki. I think one of the reasons you've encountered resistance to your contributions is that they tend not to add much, if anything, to pages. Wiki is a place to share your special wisdom. If you're interested in RuggedizedComputer''''''s, for example, try sharing what you've learned about creating them. What hidden pitfalls are there to avoid? What about shielding? What forces must they stand up to? What problems were the most difficult to solve in creating a rugged computer?

Information of this kind is usually welcomed. Offsite links to commercial sites generally don't last long.

David:  I think your newer contribution (RuggedizedComputer) is fine and within the spirit of WardsWiki.  Congratulations on finding the tone quickly; some folks have been around much longer and are still grasping for it. --TimLesher
