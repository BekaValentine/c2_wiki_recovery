Still a relative newcomer, especially to wikiwiki.

''Physical Location:''NYC

''Languages:'' C++, C, Java, Perl, Pascal

I'm increasingly using Patterns and Refactoring, so this wiki is a great place to learn some more.

Been having some real success with refactoring, java, junit/cactus. Really a change after a succession of BigDesignUpFront shops. Since I'm working alone, I can't call it XP, but it works!
