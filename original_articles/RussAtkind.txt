I am a software developer at Droplet, Inc. (http://www.droplets.com) in New York City.

My software interests include software as an engineering discipline, honing in on best practices and how to apply them, finding ways to constantly be learning, and patterns.  (Do you think this Wiki is the right place for me?  I sure hope so.)
