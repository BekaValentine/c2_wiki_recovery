Apologies for the messy stuff in this page. I am trying to find out what it is. Hopefully someone will describe this animal better with more useful details. It appears to be a heavyweight contender as a development platform though.

NetWeaver is a development platform from SapCorporation (the top EnterpriseResourcePlanning firm) that debuted in 2003 (see http://web.archive.org/web/20030119120846/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/030116/sfth044a_1.html). Although primarily a JavaPlatform product (via WebSphere) , it claim interoperability with MicrosoftDotNet.

SapCorporation is said to have close relationships with MicrosoftCorporation, SAP NetWeaver appeared in DotNet roadshows, and the company was considered as a merger partner by the Redmond giant.

Gunnar, it is not intended as spam, I am learning about significant application development platforms, and I would think after IBM and MS, this could be the next biggest, and I think it would be bigger than Sun's product offering. --dl
