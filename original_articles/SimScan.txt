This is a tool for detection of duplicate or similar fragments in JavaLanguage source code. It works on the parsed source tree and disregards differences like renamed variables or different code formatting or comments. It will also find non-exact matches where a portion of code is copy-pasted and then the code itself is modified, which is the most frequent manifestation of DuplicatedCode CodeSmell. Available stand alone and as a plug-in for IntellijIdea, BorlandJbuilder and EclipseIde.
