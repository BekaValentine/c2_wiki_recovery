Is a non-recursive acronym, for "Rencontres sur la Collaboration, la Créativité et l'Autogestion" (Meetings on Collaboration, Creativity and Self Management.) 

Past Recent Changes Camps (Portland, OR in 2006 and 2007, Montreal 2007), have set a tone for these meetings which are to be organised following an OpenSpaceTechnology ( a collaborative building of the agenda). Wikis are the key topic of the meetings, with concessions given to the wireless community and to people who, in general, are interested by collaboration, creativity and self management. In an Open Space format, every body can organise.
