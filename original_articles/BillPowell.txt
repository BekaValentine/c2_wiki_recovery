I discovered this OriginalWiki last year, I think (2007), and I'm writing about it now on my own site. I came over to find a good introductory page, and realized I could set up my own little HomePage.

This site is so different from anything else I've seen.

I hate trying to describe myself (in general, and especially in brief), so here is my personal site, if that's all right: http://billpowellisalive.com. I hope that doesn't count as spam. ;)

I should simply talk about something else. GilbertKeithChesterton, for instance.
