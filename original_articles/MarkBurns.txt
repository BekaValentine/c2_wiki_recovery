I am Interested in forms of High Tech design that apply to low tech solutions HighTechLowTech

One example is Wind-up/Solar powered radios that are being deployed in Africa
(see http://www.freeplayfoundation.org/lifelinewhat.php Lifeline radio for an example )

I am also interested in applications of products like Amorphous Silicon Solar panels
(see http://www.uni-solar.com/Our_Technology_a_Si.html) that can be used as roofing material
and generate power on to the grid reducing fuel consumption

-----
Bio-Diesel Made from waste oil rather than from virgin oil or from oil crops grown on land paid to be fallow 

----
Flue gas reduction using algae to scrub rather than electrostatic and carbon filtering

----
Ways to recycle things like computers by distributing them to schools or community centers
 as well as to people who could otherwise not afford to buy one reducing the "digital divide" 
(see http://freegeek.org or http://www.pluggedin.org)
