* Next, I will set up my internal server on another FreeBsd box-(done).
* Then I will need to rewire the house with CAT-5.
* Then switch from modem to isdn.
* Then I will set up the family systems (Linux Laptop, Win98, Mac).
* Finally (when that is done), I will be able to play with my pet project - an 8 node BeowulfCluster on a PileOfPcs (POPC). I am not sure what I will do with it yet, but CodeCracking and SetiAtHome both interest me. SetiAtHome isn't a very good fit though.
