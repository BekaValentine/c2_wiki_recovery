Manila is similar but more structured than WikiWiki as implemented here
by Ward Cunningham.  Manila has a number of bells and whistles that facilitate site management. Manila works with the UserlandFrontier server also by Dave Winer.

Visitors to a Manila supported site may read and reply, that is append a message to a page. Visitors must register their email address and obtain a password.  Only "editors" with editor access may do more than append replies to an existing page.

Pages are maintained in the order of creation like a Web message base for a discussion group. Page creation is handled like posting a message in a Web-based discussion group. HTML is implemented, but there are no simplified codes like '' for italic and ''' for bold nor any simplified conventions for lists.

You are invited to drop by and use the editor access functions of a site
maintained with Manila at: http://inetgroup.editthispage.com

In the spirit of the WikiWiki community, ''where the inmates run the asylum,'' you may use the "editor" account and password which is available via an email responder at: http://www.responders.net/form.asp?member=manila

'''Well worth exploring''' By: CliffordAdams

Manila is an interesting solution for more "controlled" groupware than Wiki.  Manila doesn't encourage linking nearly as much as Wiki, as shortcuts are automatically created only for stories (which only contributing editors can create).  Non-editors who wish to link to anything but a story apparently have to create a raw HTML link.

The situation in most Wikis is that all visitors have nearly complete control over content, but changing the presentation usually requires changing the script.  In Manila, there is a multi-level system of people not logged in (view only), ordinary users (append-only), contributing editors (who can post new stories), and managing editors (who control access, can delete stories or even users, and can modify site presentation and parameters).

The foregoing was posted on December 5, 1999 at http://inetgroup.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9 and a copy
sent to JohnDeBruyn who is the "managing editor" for the inetgroup Manila
site.

Manila has some rather high barriers to editing compared to the simplicity and openness of Wiki.  Manila has many interesting features, but also some very annoying problems.  (The "click here and there might be replies" interface for discussion threads is... there aren't polite words.)  Some of the "managing editor" features (like email notification) need to be guarded carefully to avoid real-world problems.  Manila is a reasonably open solution for those who cannot or will not accept a completely open WikiNature. -- CliffordAdams

One of the problems with Manila and many other message based systems is that
replies are buried rather than appended to the page.  A few years ago the reply or respond function in the context of the development of WikiWikiClone''''''s was discussed by JohnDeBruyn and JimCoplien in AppendOnly.  JohnDeBruyn (December 11, 1999)

Manila, especially Dave Winer's marketing and promotional ideas would be worth
a quick look by those interested in taking WikiWiki and WikiWikiClone''''''s, into
prime time.  A bit more detail is over at: http://c2.com/w2/wiki/WikiForumMarketingAndPromotionForGroupWare (BrokenLink)  JohnDeBruyn (
