The MojoNation project ended. Two projects spun off from it:

	* Mnet http://www.sf.net/projects/mnet -- ''Mnet is a universal file space. It is formed by an emergent network of autonomous nodes which self-organize to make the network robust and efficient.''
	* HiveCache http://www.hivecache.com/ -- -- ''Hive''''''Cache is a new and innovative backup and data restore solution.''
