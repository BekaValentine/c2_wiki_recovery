War waged between United Kingdom and Argentina. The disputed Falkland Islands are a British colonial possession with a democratic self-government located near the coast of Argentina. The Argentines have claimed the islands for years, and in 1982 the country's military government forcibly invaded. British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher ordered the islands be liberated from Argentina, and sent a taskforce to drive out the occupiers. 
Though the casualties were fairly high for such a minor conflict, Britain was ultimately victorious, and the islands are once again British and democratic.
