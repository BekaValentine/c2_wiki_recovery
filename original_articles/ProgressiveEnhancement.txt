ProgressiveEnhancement is GracefulDegradation turned inside-out. Consider a WebPage with advanced features (e.g., AjaxWebApplications) that is viewed in an old browser. GracefulDegradation says code it not to blow up horribly but merely operate in a reduced-functionality fashion. The ProgressiveEnhancement alternative is to build the page from scratch as the low-fidelity version, then upgrade the features on the page by replacing them entirely via JavaScript with the enhanced features. In this way, you can provide both versions of the page without having to rely on how new code fails in an old browser.
