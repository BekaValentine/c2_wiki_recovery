Having been a part time reader of the WikiWikiWeb for some time now, I finally feel ready to tackle contributing something.  Of course the most logical point to start is with my own page and a link from RecentVisitors, before moving onto more expressive areas.

I was lucky enough to get to travel the 10,318 miles from ''Cape Town, South Africa'', all the way to Vancouver for OOPSLA '98 (http://www.acm.org/sigplan/oopsla/oopsla98) and got to meet some of the faces behind many of the names on Wiki.  This in turn inspired me to make the effort and become a contributor.
