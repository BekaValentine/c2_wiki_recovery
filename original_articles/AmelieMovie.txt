This movie should particularly appeal to programmers and other terminally clever people.

She's a BigDesignUpFront sort of gal - notice that she seems to put forth a lot of complicated RubeGoldberg plans into action with no contingency plans. But this is one of those movies where serendipity happens a lot.

Perfect date movie.
