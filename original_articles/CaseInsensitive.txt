Hmm, no page by that name yet?

Sounds too trivial, doesn't it?
----
But shouldn't someone here at WikiWiki categorize ProgrammingLanguages by
whether they treat function names, classes and variable names case-sensitive
or CaseInsensitive?! Shouldn't be there be a discussion of the ProsAndCons?

* BasicLanguage - case insensitive as far as I remember
* CeeLanguage - case sensitive, and cause for all following languages being it
* PhpLanguage - mixed: function names are case-insensitive, but variable names are sensitive -  isn't this somehow inconsequent? why did they make it so?
* BooLanguage - similar to Python.  It is case sensitive, but there is a patch for the next version that allows you to have a case-insensitive option.

My first shocking experience with CaseSensitivity was, when a prof from SwitzerLand visited my school, talking two hours about switching from PascalLanguage to the OberonLanguage (Oberon-2 actually) and I only discovered in the very very last example shown, that it all was case-sensitive (...)
