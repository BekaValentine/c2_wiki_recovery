	 :	In many segments of the sector, vendors have a difficult time convincing customers to upgrade to newer versions of their products when installed versions work adequately. While this crisis has yet to reach some segments (for example, security, where one can always count on the bad guys' creativity to create new customer needs), it has reached many — as evidenced by overall modest growth projections of around 8 percent per annum for the enterprise software market overall.
