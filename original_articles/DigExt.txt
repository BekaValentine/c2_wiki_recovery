DigExt is a part of MSIE (MicroSoft Internet Explorer) that appears in the "User Agent" string that is sent to any website that you visit.

The user agent string provides statistical information on the operating ststems and details or visitors to a site.

Not all versions of MSIE add "DigExt" to the user agent string every time a page is requested.
