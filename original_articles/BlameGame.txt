This is a fun activity. Something that must be experienced at least once.  It doesn't sound like a very nice game.

If you've never experienced it before, here's how it goes (one example anyway):

Start by identifying a serious problem. Then blame someone.

Blaming involves:
	* Point a finger directly at someone unrelated to the problem
	* Come up with some unfounded false accusation to apply, clearly implicating the other person
	* State it loudly and unashamedly
	* Watch that person shrivel in terror

The goal is to keep the BlameSession going as long as possible. 

Remember, at no point in time is anyone allowed to offer a serious remedy of the actual problem.

Bonus points for blaming people not involved in the meeting but keeping the BlameSession alive.

The only way to end a BlameGame occurs when it seems inevitable that the BlameSession cannot continue. At this point, election of a ScapeGoat should occur.
