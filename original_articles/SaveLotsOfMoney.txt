To get SimpleDesign adopted, suggest that you'll be saving a bundle by not spending as much on big, expensive, useless "tools", "frameworks", or "solutions".

Applies to all aspects of development, even - and maybe first and foremost - to the development infrastructure. Compare JavaUnit to track the few bugs (only they're just defects) versus some expensive BugTrackingSoftware - even if it's an OpenSource product, it's going to cost a bundle just on people-time - installing, configuring, and getting used to it. PERT tools versus IndexCard''''''s.

No, it's much simpler than that:
'''''"If we use a simpler design, we won't have to write and maintain as much code."'''''
Less code = less money.

''This seems to be a common ''benefit'' of ExtremeProgramming. Perhaps this ProtoPattern should relate to the persuasion tactic, and that 'LessCodeLessMoney' is a different or related ProtoPattern.''

''Is there any evidence that this persuasion tactic works? -- RH''

''I tried the "won't have to write and maintain as much"-approach, but people simply don't believe it's possible to write less. My guess is that the "no expensive tools" approach can work better.''
