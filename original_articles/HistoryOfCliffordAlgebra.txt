There is an interesting web page on the history of CliffordAlgebra at http://members.fortunecity.com/jonhays/clifhistory.htm

There is another interesting paper at http://sinai.mech.fukui-u.ac.jp/ITM2003/GA_LeibnitzDream.pdf under the title Geometric Algebra - Libenitz' Dream.  I think the author is E. Hitzer.   -- JohnFletcher
