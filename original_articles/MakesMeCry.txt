Some things make me cry.

	* Focus on producing ThreeRingBinder''''''s instead of an actual product.

	* Belief that humans can perfectly design a software system given enough time. (failed assumption: humans are perfect)

	* The failure to teach critical thinking skills in lieu of recipes for living.

	* The destruction of forest for crash farming.

	* Demagoguery

	* Sunset over the ocean

	* ?
