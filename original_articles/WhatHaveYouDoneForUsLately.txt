WhatHaveYouDoneForUsLately is a pernicious AntiPattern which contrives to give us the impression that NothingWeCanDoIsEnough -- sorry that just isn't true!  People who act this way should be noted in your PearlHarborFile with their name and the list of accomplishments that you have and the list of accomplishments that they have just for the day when they push this a little too far.  I hate these AntiPattern''''''s, but a prudent person must BePrepared. -- RaySchneider

If this is being done to you, you should... BeProudOfYourRealAccomplishments and TellPeopleWhatYouDid by CelebrateYourAccomplishment.
