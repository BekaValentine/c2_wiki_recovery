The Research Triangle Park is a 7,000-acre research park in the center of North Carolina. It is the largest research park in the United States and is named for the Triangle formed by the three universities: DukeUniversity at Durham, the UniversityOfNorthCarolina at Chapel Hill, and NorthCarolinaStateUniversity in Raleigh.

RedHatTheCompany has long been based there.

DataGeneral's partial relocation from Massachusetts to the Research Triangle contributed to its late-Seventies troubles as recorded in ''TheSoulOfaNewMachine''.
