SmartDevices are those which take note of surrounding environment through sensors to provide actions which its designers have thought to be appropriate, based upon ItDepends or upon What, If, For, When, Where, Who and While situations or states.  It does not yet mean devices which think as humans do, for to do so might place the device in role similar to that of humans, thus allowing as possible, undesirable, uncontrolled, autonomic and perhaps destructive states and actions which could threaten Public Safety. 

SmartDevices we use today usually have switches, buttons and sensors and power supplies which humans manipulate for the purpose of aiding the human in pursuing desired functions.
