Small software company that aimed to bring some of the features of JefRaskin's HumaneInterface to MicrosoftWindows. AzaRaskin, son of JefRaskin, was president (and perhaps still is). By 2007 they had two products, EnsoLauncher and EnsoWords. In 2008 TheMozillaProject hired Aza Raskin and two of Humanized's three other developers, while the fourth left to work on other things. Another Humanized project, Songza (http://www.songza.com) had already been spun off.
