PhpLib is a PhpLanguage Base Library.

Frankly, the main virtue of PhpLib is that it has a lot of stuff. That's also the main downfall. It tries to be everything to all people and therefore doesn't do any one particular thing all that brilliantly. There are other tools to accomplish each of the phplib parts in variously better (or worse) ways, but phplib brings together many functions in one place.

Much of phplib is a simple wrapper around corresponding libc functions, down to the argument order.
