''Problem Frames: Analyzing and Structuring Software Development Problems'' by Michael Jackson. ISBN:020159627X

This book elaborates the idea of a ProblemFrame that MichaelJackson has been working on for the last decade. I've read the book carefully twice, each time teaching a course using it.  I learned a lot the second time through, and now think I understand it.  This is very important work, but it has not yet reached the level where it is useful to most developers.  We need a body of worked-out problems, and we need to be able to tell developers that if their problem involves a certain ProblemFrame then they should look at certain solution techniques.  But I think that this book is a goldmine of ideas for researchers and that twenty years from now it will still be considered an important book. -- RalphJohnson
