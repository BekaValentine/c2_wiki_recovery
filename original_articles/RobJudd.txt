I am currently an Adjunct Faculty member of the University of Denver department
of ComputerScience. I am planning to teach a class on DesignPatterns in 
ObjectOrientedProgramming in the Winter or Spring quarter 2003. As of 
September I am relieving TimKemper of the responsibility for arranging the 
meetings to study the GangOfFour book.

I may be contacted at rjudd@cs.du.edu.
