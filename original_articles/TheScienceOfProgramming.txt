The amazon reviews are quite good.  What do people here think?

An excellent book. I used and after many years eventually threw my copy away ... several years later hunted down another copy, which I'll be careful not to throw away again. --AlistairCockburn

''Could you give some idea of why this is a book you consult continually, rather than being a read-once book? The description on Amazon made it sound more like the latter.''
