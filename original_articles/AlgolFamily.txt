Most modern programming languages - C, C++, VB, Delphi, Java, Python, and even Perl - use syntax and concepts that originated with the AlgolLanguage. So they're called AlgolFamily languages.

Some call them C-like languages since C is so popular.

Characteristics include:

* functions and subroutines
* value and reference-based parameters
* procedural and imperative emphasis
* code blocks (StructuredProgramming) which include these statements at least:
** if/else 
** while
** switch or case

Counter-argument:

As illustrated above the dominant opinion is that most common lanaguages derive their syntax from C, and C derives its syntax from Algol, therefore these languages belong in the so-called AlgolFamily. First, categorizing languages based on semantics rather than syntax is probably a better practice. Second, the Algol68 syntax on its WikiPedia page reminds me more of ML and its descendants, mainly due to the pattern matching (especially in the '73 revision) and lack of braces. Finally, Algol68 seems like a better language than most the ones listed above too despite its age, so I'd hate to lump it in with them too.

''The term or reference is often used in a general sense such that looking at specific dialects of Algol are missing the bigger picture of the intended meaning of a general "flavor" of language style. Perhaps a similar topic called "Algol Flavor" should be created to clarify, but so far they are too close to deserve a split at this point, in my opinion. A note pointing out the difference, such as this, is good-enough.''

''Note that Algol 68 is a later revision of Algol 60, not without controversy. Algol 68 alone shouldn't be seen as the model for the vast Algol family, which trace their roots back to Algol 60.''
