[ComponentDesignPatterns | ComponentDesignPatternsAcknowledgements]

All three submissions were accepted for workshops at PlopConference 1999.  Thanks to all shepherd/PC and additional feedback that helped us complete conference-ready proceedings.  Here are the patterns being workshopped:

'''Component Distribution Patterns''' (Shepherd: RobertHirschfeld)
	* ReplicatedObject*
	* DistributedFacade (was FacadesAsDistributedComponents)
	* ObjectFactory*
	* DistributedCommand*

'''Component Interaction Patterns''' (Shepherd: JoshuaKerievsky)
	* AbstractInteractions
	* ComponentBus
	* ThirdPartyBinding
	* ComponentGlue
	* ConsumerProducer*

'''Layering Frameworks in CBD''' (Shepherd: BradAppleton)
	* LayeredComponentFramework (was LayeredFrameworks)

''* Some of the patterns are new and not yet part of the ComponentDesignPatterns collection.''
