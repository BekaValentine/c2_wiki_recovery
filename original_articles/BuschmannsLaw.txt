'''Do not write up your own idea as a pattern.'''

''We seek to write patterns that objectively capture expert knowledge that's broadly applicable.  It's hard to be objective about your own idea, and it's easy to be overly enthusiastic if you have a stake in the idea. Write up patterns you've used, applied, that you've seen applied elsewhere, and that you think are wonderful.''
