An age in which there is light (metaphorically speaking, of course). Perhaps the author of the piece that linked you here was referring to something like a second enlightenment. Personally, I believe it happened around 1998 - 2001 and now we're going back down hill for another series of bloody wars before human intellect rules the unwashed masses once again. -- Dan

The problem with an AgeOfLight is that no-one realizes it until after it has ended, suggesting that it is simply an illusion created by the passage of time. What we had before always seems better than what we have now.

This isn't true. People during the Rennaissance certainly understood their period to be an age of rebirth, to a greater extent than it actually was. And I believe the same could be said for the Enlightment, where people certainly believed things were better than they had ever been before. Just to take modern Western examples.

''Could you say that an AgeOfLight is juxtapose to an age of dark, such as TheDarkAge''''s ? -- SusannahWilliams

Well, the age before it has to be dark''er''.  But there's no sharp break between the later Middle Ages, which were not especially dark, and the rennaissance.  Likewise, the time before the Enlightenment wasn't exactly backwards.  So I wouldn't really say so.  

I believe an AgeOfLight (or any other age for that matter) to be a virtual term for possibly one of the following (but not limited to) seemingly positive events compared to experiences from the past in the eyes of a statistically determined majority of beings during a certain period of time:
* Relatively thriving economic welfare.
* A relatively high boost in technology.
* A relatively positive state of mind.
* Any other relatively major and seemingly positive influence for a statistically determined majority of beings.

Also known as a GoldenAge.

Enlightenment is a constant progression...an evolution if you will.  That said, we are ALWAYS in an AgeOfLight.  While future generations may not hold fast to the same values of generations past, without question, they are evolving and growing. The problem occurs when one attempts to define enlightenment.  The mere act of defining limits and 'pigeon holes' progression, leaving the masses to feel that the past was 'better' than the present and continually looking forward to 'light' when they arn fact, basking in the 'light' at this very moment.
