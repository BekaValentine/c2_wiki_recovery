
A corporate culture, found in many fast-track corporations (as well as in the UnitedStates military) where those seeking career advancement are expected to steadily ClimbTheCorporateLadder, and being passed over for an expected promotion effectively ends all opportunities for further advancment (and eventually may result in one being cashiered out, as the fast-trackers below view one's current position as an promotion opportunity).  If one doesn't seek advancement in such an organization; one can maintain a steady career in a low-level position, but any position of significant stature is highly competitive and subject to rather cutthroat competition.

Many view this as an AntiPattern.
