http://amasci.com/amateur/traffic/trafexp.html provides a method whereby you, personally, yes you, can reduce and often eliminate traffic. At a minimum you can convert your commute from stop 'n' go stress to a leisurely meander with hardly a tap on the brake.

AntiTraffic has deep implications for LettingThingsSlide too. If you regard the use of the brake as ManagementByCrisis, and if you regard ManagementByCrisis as something to prevent, then you can observe many situations in life in which you are working stop'n'go. By implementing AntiTraffic as a time-management technique you can resolve these situations without effort.
