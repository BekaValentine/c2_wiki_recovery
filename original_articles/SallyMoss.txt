Sally found XP by clicking on a link in the Connextra website, and met KentBeck two days later at a meeting of XtC. She immediately decided that XP was a good thing to argue about, but it took another month before she was convinced it was a good thing to implement.

Sally is not now and never has been a programmer, and therefore prides herself on being the Managerial Devil's Advocate whenever the discussion gets too developer-centric. XP is for everyone!
