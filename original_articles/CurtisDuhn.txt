Here's what I'm working on these days:

	* Collaborative Filtering for Weblogs - It occurred to me the other day that one could discover communitites of related weblogs by analyzing commonalities in the pages they hyperlink to.  Using this information, a weblog aggregator could recommend articles from different weblogs by observing the types of articles a particular user typically reads.  Commonalities between usage information can subsequently be used as feedback to strengthen the collaborative filtering effect.  I'm currently implementing this as the next version of http://www.motherlog.com/

	* Uber - Fantasy programming language/thought exercise based on the premise that the internet has been grossly underutilized in support of software reuse.  This project is rambunctiously unencumbered by the requirement to ever be implemented.

	* Gnome - I did some work on the GDict panel applet.

	* Day job - I am the senior software architect for Pinpoint Networks, Inc. (http://www.pinpoint.com/)
