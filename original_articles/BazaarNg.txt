Bazaar-ng, or bzr, is being developed by MartinPool at CanonicalLtd. The charter is to ''build a distributed version-control system that open-source hackers will love to use''. This means that Martin is looking at "all" other products on the market, trying to find out what features to assimilate and what to ignore. BazaarNg has a slight GnuArch influence, and enables decentralized work.

As of 2005-03-22, Bazaar-ng is self-hosting.
