Pie, a.k.a. Pie Web M{a,e}sher, is a lightweight content management system for Web-sharing documents, files, and arbitrary pieces of information. It features an emphasis on fast content delivery to its recipients rather than sophisticated add-ons, therefore conveying compiled output instead of performing time consuming run-time processing.
