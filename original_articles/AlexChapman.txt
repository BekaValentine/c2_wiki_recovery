I have worked for IBM (UK and USA), Fujitsu-ICL and NCR in various development roles since 1988. Each of the organizations I have been part of have used their own home-grown development process, with varying degrees of rigor and quantity when it came to requirements and design documentation.

I had heard of ExtremeProgramming and read a few articles, but it wasn't until around the time that I attended a talk on PairProgramming by LaurieWilliams in 2001 that I became interested. I read ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange by KentBeck and it clicked. I couldn't understand why I hadn't seen it before.

In September 2001 my team began to adopt some of the ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices, and now have ContinuousIntegration with JakartaAnt/CruiseControl and hundreds of JavaUnit tests. We do occasional PairProgramming and RefactorMercilessly. These practices have had a significant impact on quality and confidence. I would like to adopt more ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices, and am especially interested in the PlanningGame.

At XpUniverseTwoThousandTwo I met BillKrebs and began discussing the idea of '''TriangleXpUsersGroup'''. I also did a little XpFest with DuffOmelia of RoleModelSoftware and through him met JeffCanna who was thinking along the same lines. The first meeting of the TriangleXpUsersGroup (TriangleXpMeetingOne) was held on Monday October 29, 2002.
