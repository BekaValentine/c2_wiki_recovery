JustaProgrammer, husband, dad, not necessarily in that order.

Likes: martial arts (kung fu, years ago, interested in -but not practicing- Judo), basketball, snowboard, camping, cooking (mignon, anyone?), red wine, computer games, playing guitar (currently, blues), and, of course, programming.

Dislikes: stupidity, bad intentions.

Technical notes: Lately I've tending towards SoftwareManagement. I like to develop small, high tech apps over big, commercial ones. I'm proficient using CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, DelphiLanguage, PerlLanguage, JavaLanguage. Not tied to anyone, though.

My primary language is Spanish, and my english is self taught. That explains the ocassional mispelling or grammar fault.

Oh, my homepage is at http://leus.epublish.cl. Sorry, spanish only.

Welcome to the WikiWiki, no apologies are necessary. This wiki has people from all over the world as regular visitors who share a common interest in topics using the computer languages you mention, the fact that national or cultural languages are different does not seem to impede helpful, meaningful sharing. We try not to be stupid, and try to keep our intentions to the positive side, but occasional slippage occurs.
