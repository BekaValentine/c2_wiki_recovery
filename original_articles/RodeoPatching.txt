RodeoPatching is the act of customizing an unfrozen program without sending the patches upstream for some reason, and therefore designing the patches in a way to make them less likely to break on high-flux upstream development. This can become a real art form. The word rodeo comes from the imagination that the bucking code is trying to throw you off, but you somehow manage to keep on it.
