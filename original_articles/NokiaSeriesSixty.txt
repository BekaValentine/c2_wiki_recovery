The Nokia Series-60 platform is a specialized form of SymbianOs, with a user interface suitable for SmartPhone''''''s. The first phone using it, the Nokia 7650 camera-phone, is now on the market (June 2002).

Series-60 phones have a (typically colour) screen resolution of 176x208, and are one-hand-operated (i.e. they have a phone-style keypad and no pen input).

The Java supported for Series-60 is MIDP (MobileInformationDeviceProfile).

Matsushita (i.e. Panasonic), another SymbianOs partner, have announced that they are trialling the Series-60 platform. Siemens have also announced (May 2002) that they will use Series-60 and work with Nokia to develop it further.

[Please note that Symbian is now a dead OS line. Nokia have entered into an agreement with Microsoft, and Windows Phone will eventually replace Symbian completely. Oh, well. Scratch one.]
