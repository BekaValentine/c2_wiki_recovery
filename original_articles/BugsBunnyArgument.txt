Everyone who's seen Bugs and Daffy argue over which hunting season it is in front of a bewildered Elmer know what kind of argument this is.  For the benefit of those who haven't seen the cartoon (probably "Rabbit Fire" or could be "Duck, Rabbit, Duck"), Elmer Fudd (the hunter in the Looney Tunes cartoons) is pointing a shotgun at Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, who commence arguing about which animal is in season.

 Bugs: "Duck Season." (grabs barrel of shotgun, points it at Daffy)
 Daffy: "RABBIT SEASON!" (points shotgun at Bugs)
 "Duck Season." (points shotgun at Daffy)
 "RABBIT SEASON!" (points shotgun at Bugs)

And so forth, until Bugs uses Daffy's passion against him:
 "Duck Season."
 "RABBIT SEASON!"
 "Duck Season."
 "RABBIT SEASON!"  Daffy points shotgun at Bugs.
 "Rabbit Season."  Bugs grabs shotgun, feints like he is going to 
          point it at Daffy, points it back to himself.

 "DUCK SEASON!"   Daffy grabs gun, points it himself
 "Rabbit Season."  Bugs grabs shotgun, points it at himself.
 "DUCK SEASON:  FIIIIIIRE!!!"

 ...

I've noticed many ThreadMode arguments here tend to degenerate into something like this. Sometimes, just like in the cartoon, passionate people forget what they are arguing about and trip up.

However, it usually turns out to be Elmer Season. ''Naw, son, it's baseball season!''

[Only when Elmer is hunting Bugs--Bugs never gets blasted.  Daffy, on the other hand, gets blasted all the time.  And in the world of LooneyTunes; shotgun blasts (and other sources of traumatic injury in the real world, such as explosives and falling off of cliffs) are mere annoyances...]
