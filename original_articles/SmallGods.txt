SmallGods...what can you say?

The SmallGods theory says that small gods are created after a critical mass of believers believes in a concept.  Thus, there is a Small God of Python, a Small God of Ruby, a Medium-Sized God of OOP, and an evil god of Visitor Patterns.  :)

TerryPratchett coined the theory.  DiscWorld has so many SmallGods that there are no athiests, as those who openly declare that there are no gods find themselves on the receiving end of Philosophical Proof by Immolation, AKA the thunderbolt.
