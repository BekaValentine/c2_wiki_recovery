Cayenne is an OpenSource object-relational persistence framework written in Java. It provides tools and libraries to work with relational databases in an object-oriented way. Cayenne consists of class libraries and a GUI tool for ObjectRelationalMapping and deployment.  It  is shipped under ApacheStyleLicense to have as fewer restrictions as possible. Some ideas were inspired by NeXT EnterpriseObjectsFramework.
