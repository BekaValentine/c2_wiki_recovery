'' Here are some things you might try while experimenting with html pages which exist in iframes (As in WikiDisplayedAsPages): '' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.201210140701

I attempted the following using FireFox as my default browser in my particular user configuration (you may find it to work with yours YMMV ( http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ymmv )

When I have selected an iframe to display its original or linked page, and I find the display inadequate in size to display information as easy to read either because it is too small vertically or horizontally
* I use the following procedure to be useful and allowing return to previous state
** Use the final example in WikiDisplayedAsPages in html form (by building and displaying the html page built, or using the trick in TextPad described on that page)
*** example: http://donaldr.noyes.com/WikiTest/G3P_WikiWithMore.htm
** Select the first (RecentChanges - which is very long and contains many links making it suitable for demonstrating how far you may proceed and yet return using back)
*** Right click in the iframe, select "Show Only This frame" Then select the back arrow in the top menu or the back selection in a right click, returning you to the previous
*** Try the same except proceed browsing as much as you want in the full page format, returning to the first display by however many back arrow clicks (easiest), or left click back selections (works but more work) as it takes.

'''selection or grouping of pages'''
* you might use the above procedure (particularly if you are a RecentChangesJunkie) to start and proceed through a browsing session 
** which is targeted on a certain group, classification or Category of pages
** example: Federation of Information:
