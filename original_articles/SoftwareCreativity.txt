Robert L. Glass

SoftwareCreativity; Prentice Hall 1995
[ISBN 0-13-147364-6]

Concerning the question "which is more important in software construction: brilliant process or brilliant people", Glass is definitely on the people's side.
The book is more like a series of short articles (some by other authors) about  discipline and flexibility, formal methods and heuristics, optimizing versus satisficing, quantitative and qualitative reasoning, process and product, intellectual and clerical tasks, theory and practice, fun and tedium, industry and academia...

I loved his reflection on his experience as member of SEI.
Fun reading with some "aha" and lots of "I saw this".
