The javax.jdo.PersistenceManager interface defines most of the JDO developer API. It contains methods for persisting objects, deleting objects, creating queries, looking up objects by ID, transaction control and cache management. PersistenceManager's (PM's) are created from a PersistenceManagerFactory (PMF) just like JDBC connections are created from a JDBC driver.
