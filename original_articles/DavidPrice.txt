I'm a software developer at Nokia Research Center in Helsinki, Finland. I'm currently developing prototype client-server applications using JavaMicroEdition (MobileInformationDeviceProfile) and JavaEnterpriseEdition (especially JavaServlets).

I used to work with ClaudeBouillin & MarcGirod. Claude's Irish band 'Boolabus' (http://www.geocities.com/boolabus/) is great fun!

Some pages I've created:
	* UmlAsciiArt (and siblings)
	* MobileInformationDeviceProfile, ConnectedLimitedDeviceConfiguration, JavaMicroEdition
	* NokiaSeriesSixty

Spammers may have got my e-mail address from this page, so I'm afraid I have to obscure it a little.
Nokia's domain name is 'nokia.com'; my e-mail account there is 'David.A.Price'.
