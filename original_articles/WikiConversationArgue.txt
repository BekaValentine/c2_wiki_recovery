We gotta argue about WikiConversation or we'll never know whether the stuff
on WikiConversationAgree is the stuff about which we agree, or just the stuff
someone articulate has managed to pull on the rest of us.

Do what thou wilt with WikiConversation, but aim to just grow this beast here.
If you reckon something here has consensused out, and folk agree, move it
to WikiConversationAgree: take your own contributions to a thread out of here
when they're what that page says (well, maybe leave the why and the wherefore
that brought us to that agreement).  If you can see that there's a few well-defined camps into which opinion forms, maybe set them out on WikiConversation, see what folk do to it there.  When stuff's entrenched there,
maybe rip some of it out of here just like if it'd been agreed on.

If you see a page with a natural name, and you think it needs some arguing
about, create it's ~Argue page and argue on it.

Make it up as we go along.  Do what we will.  Remember good humour in arguing,
and never forget what GoodStyle tells you.  But argue, anyway - without thesis
and antithesis, there ain't gonna be no synthesis.

Oh, and say who you woz and (at least if it's out of order) when you sed it.

What do '''you''' think ?

I think ~Debate might be a more neutral tag for n-party m-sided Debate where both 
argument and agreeing take place. -EB
