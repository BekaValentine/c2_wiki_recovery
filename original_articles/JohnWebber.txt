I'm head of Software Development for a small German company, DENT-iV GmbH (http://www.claridentis.de), in Gr√ºnwald near Munich. We have a Java EE (Spring, Hibernate etc.) software platform used for dental health care programs. I come from Seattle, but have been living in Germany since 1988. I'm what's called a "Quereinsteiger" in German - literally a crosswise-enterer. I spent nearly 20 years as a professional musician (pianist and conductor), and have been working full-time as a software developer and team leader of software developers since 2000. Topics of XP and Agile interest me greatly.
