A type of WikiBot that tries to prevent a particular page, which the bot author doesn't like, from existing.

Operation is simple. Periodically, if the page is found to exist by the script, the script deletes it. Most such scripts then DoubleDelete it with a second IP, to keep it from being restored via EditCopy. (In addition, in the current Wiki implementation, this removes the page from QuickChanges; WikiGnome''''''s who are QuickChangesJunkie''''''s might not know it is gone).

A few defenses against WikiPageDeletionBot''''''s (that WikiGnome''''''s can employ):

* Keep an offline copy of the page around - WikiHistory will expire after a while, and I wouldn't depend on Google's cache.
* Rename the page (or copy it to a new location with an obvious name). Chances are, the WikiVandal will notice this and modify the script accordingly. The good and bad of this:
** Attempts to delete all copies are more likely to trip the SurgeProtector.
** However, there would be a bit more load on the servers.
