At one point, due to deletion of tons of WikiSpam, my usual IP address was banned by the SurgeProtector for a while; it took an e-mail to Ward to un-ban me. In the interest of FullDisclosure, I deleted a bunch of spam, changed my UserName cookie, and seconded my own deletions... I was banned for several hours. (I was able to verify this by accessing WikiWiki through my home ISP, but only over Lynx.)  This particular spammer, in addition to defacing existing pages, tromped through WantedPages and created lots of new pages with existing links to them (a clever tactic).  As undoing this spam required page deletion, that left me (as well as other WikiGnome''''''s) vulnerable to the SurgeProtector.

Perhaps it would be beneficial to have a whitelist of well-known WikiGnome''''''s who are exempt from the SurgeProtector, so efforts to clean up such spam don't inadvertently get one banned?  I'm not asking to be on such a list myself, but it might be a good idea--especially if more spam attacks of this nature occur.

Like they say, you are honest to a fault, Scott. Next time, use an OpenProxy. -- CostinCozianu

Does the SurgeProtector also protect from too many page creations/edits? It seems like that would slow the spammer down. Also how about a page link similar to EditPage that was a "DeSpam" - it would revert a page by stepping backwards through EditHistory to one that had fewer external hyperlinks (i.e. http:// refs) - Perhaps with a threshold of five-ten? -- LayneThomas
