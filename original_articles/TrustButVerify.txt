MeatBall has already a good reference to further details on the concept of TrustButVerify. My view is we need lots more verification for the same level of trust we grant people we interact with, compared to just a few decades ago.

And on this open wiki, where an excellent analogy of a bar was made, more verification is needed due to the combination of:
* a state of flux (and therefore an unstable set of WikiSocialNorms)
* lots of people operate behind IpUsername masks, even long-term participants and regulars who sometimes do identify themselves
* there have not been effective mechanisms to stamp out trolls, or other people who do not respect NonviolentCommunication.

'''On the subject of UserName'''

While maintaining respect for the RealNamesOnlyOrAnonymous viewpoint (more so as WardCunningham preferred it this way), I hate to say that NeKs made some valid points and we need to MakeRoomForAllViewpoints. I hope those discussing this subject can AgreeToDisagree and both redirect their energies to bigger issues at WardsWiki.

One of the issues with RealName''''''s is that TrustButVerify tests have shown people who consistently use RealName suffer more from WikiNoisePollution.

And the use of RealName diminishes the RightToVanish in this age of the BigBrother. -- Trying-Anon-for-now

'''S''''''hatteredGlass UserStory'''

I have recently seen the movie S''''''hatteredGlass which is a docudrama that told the story of a real life journalist for a reputable magazine who had a short period of fame through getting a series of sensational but fabricated stories published there. Subsequently a GoogleSearch led to this link for people who is interested WhatHappened to this individual, date in URL. ef http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/perspective/bal-pe.journalism05jun05,1,5612367.story?coll=bal-perspective-headlines [dead link 7/11/2005]
* The main character in the film actually wrote a book called TheF''''''abulist and could have even profited from it. See how (some of) the media see things at http://www.cheatingculture.com/stephenglass.htm 

* StephenG''''''lass is not the only reporter who became a celebrity for his creativity, see the story of another at http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/11/DDG4SD61TU1.DTL

''Note I wished the S''''''ocietyWithoutMediaIsBetter page is still around as this story merit some discussion about related topics, for example "changes in Value systems".''
