C/C++ is a mythical programming language that in spite of its nonexistence is nonetheless frequently chosen for software projects.

The term 'C/C++' can be legitimately used to refer to a codebase that includes both CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus source or code that is both valid C and valid C++, or perhaps a toolset that includes both C and C++ compilers.  It's also acceptable for indicating skill required or possessed, as in a job requirement or on a résumé.

The erroneous usage is to suggest that there is a single language known as C/C++.  There is not.

''Not to be confused with ObjectiveCeePlusPlus.  This is ObjectiveCee and CeePlusPlus mixed in the same source files, as supported by the GnuCompilerCollection and Apple specifically.''
