We use WebSphere Studio to build JavaServerPages.  We are told to use only PointAndClickNoJ''''''avascript techniques to develop our web pages.  We are not allowed to HandCodeJavaServerP''''''age it.  This UtopianIdeaOfSeparatingTheT''''''asks forces us to create SpartanInterface''''''s but that's ok, we've gotten used to it.  We try and keep to processing in the Java bean's getters as they're placed on the JavaServerPage.  Also, we sometimes using LazyInitialization, or what I call VirtuallyInitializedAccessors.

Let's be frank, they pay us Java guys plenty of dough, they'd like to be able to go back to their higher ups and say.... Yeah but, we've got a plan. The Java guys come in and build the nuts and bolts of the application, and the rest is maintained by non-programmer types. That way, we're controlling costs.
