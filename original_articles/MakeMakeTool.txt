A MakeMakeTool is a tool which will automate the construction of makefiles. 

Examples:
* GNU automake
* imake
* CMake 
***http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html 
** Generates makefiles for a variety of make implementations and MSVisualStudio workspaces. Good for cross-platform projects to avoid the difficulty of maintaining multiple parallel build systems.
* RakeMake 
** A RubyLanguage tool to generate makefiles. Seems to use a neat OO approach to building the dependency graph.
* All dependency tools like fastdep, makedep, ocamldep, ...

Some say that such tools are AddingEpicycles to work around the inherent intractability of make, and that a better approach is to replace make entirely.
