'''MoreLightThanHeatGuideline aim to improve the overall quality of WardsWiki.'''

OpenAuthor and being subjected to CommunityProcess

''The assumption is that if every and all active participants (people who add/change/delete) aim to have their contributions, when netted, result in a better Wiki in any month, then Wiki itself is moving ahead.''
* it is important to note the '''"net"''' word in the above sentence.  As I think most people would agree to "not being perfect" on the wiki 100% of the time. It is an important fault tolerant mechanism and often overlooked by ICT community. -- DavidLiu

* The above is broken in way too many places, so that it needs to be deleted and restarted again with minimal to no assumptions and preconceived notions. To begin with there's no CommunityProcess and there's never been such a thing as far as I can remember, unless you want to trivialize the idea by defining "comunnity process" := "whatever crap happens on wiki". And then the assumption is just wrong. It's trivial to find examples (even recent ones) where everybody aims for improving wiki, yet the net result is negative. --Costin (last change and merit some thoughts for contents in HeatDeathOfWiki? )

These activities are important to improving the quality of Wiki (at beginning of 2005)
* LetHotPagesCool and stay away from EditWar
* help remove new spam and reverse vandalism -> FixBrokenWindows
* review and improve existing OnTopic material
* MakeRoomForAllViewpoints and aim for a PositiveDialogueCommunity
* provide non-controversial guidance to newcomers. Encourage them to endorse CommunityExpectations
* cheer up WikiZen''''''s discouraged by WikiNoisePollution
* help defuse tensions amongst parties at odds with even other
* review DeletionConventions AGAIN, then
** mark (old + useless + abandoned) OnTopic material for ''later deletion''
** mark (old + useless + abandoned) OffTopic material for ''later deletion''
