'''P''''''ositiveSpin'''

This is how one can turn some statements with can'ts, don'ts and otherwise positioned statements into something about what can be done, what should be done, and what might be done.

Template:
*If one says that it can't ....
**You can say then try ....

Examples:
* It can't be done.
** Why not try to do it first and know for sure?

* You don't like it, you can turn it off.  
** If I like it, I'll keep it on.

* Test it and make it fail. (from TestDrivenDevelopment)
** Make it so that when tested, it succeeds. 

* Secret things are valuable.
** Sharing things will increase their value.

'''N''''''egativeSpin'''

Spin can be such that a rotation or an interjection of doubt and cynicism can kill any optimism or hope. Spin can be applied with intention to harm, destroy, or negate helpful and hopeful things. This type of statement intends to change descriptions such that they are about what can't be done, what  shouldn't be done, what is impossible to do.
