I am now working for InternationalBusinessMachines, working on Virtual device
support for the LinuxKernel on the iSeries (formerly AS/400).

I have some experience with LispLanguage, SchemeLanguage,
and HaskellLanguage (see also FunctionalProgrammingLanguage).

I find the similarities between the SmalltalkLanguage culture and the ForthLanguage
culture highly intriguing.  (RefactorMercilessly, YouArentGonnaNeedIt.)

I'm mostly a WikiLurker and QuickChanges junkie.
