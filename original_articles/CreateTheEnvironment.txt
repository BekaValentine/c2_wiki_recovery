An old saying:
	  :	"Don't create the thing; create the environment."

It's used to sway managers away from MicroManagement. Instead of reviewing every line of code to make sure you get what you want, create a worthwhile and rewarding environment that automatically motivates developers to do what you want.

----

An old approach - make a list of what you mean:

Present here for managers a list of the things that would motivate creativity:

''(The change of description at the head of this page ("creative"-> "do what you want") may have rendered my lists irrelevant. Feel free to move/delete)''

Creative environments often have
	* challenge
	* freedom
	* support for different ideas (and systems for communicating them)
	* trust
	* dynamism
	* playfulness
	* debates
	* conflict
	* support risk taking
	* allow time for investigating ideas
	* scenery
	* music

Barriers to creativity. The inverses would help creativity.

	* Inadequate recruitment/selection
	* Confused organisational structure
	* Inadequate control
	* Poor tools
	* Poor training
	* Low motivation
	* Poor teamwork
	* Inappropriate management philosophy
	* Unclear aims
	* Unfair rewards

Then the manager can CreateTheEnvironment and you can Create the Thing.
