I think "adoption" is the wrong metaphor for what you do when you change culture. When you adopt a child, you get a bunch of hidden history with current and future manifestations. When you give birth to a child, you get to screw them up yourselves, but at least you have a chance of seeing the connection between your parenting and their behavior.

The values are the DNA, the XP12 are the parts of the newborn, and from there you get to grow the kid however you want.

In the spirit of giving birth instead of adopting, I think your adaptation of the newborn so as not to be instantly rejected is masterful. -- KentBeck

Adapt, adopt and improve, motto of the rountable -- JohnCleese
