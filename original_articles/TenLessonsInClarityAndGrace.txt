Written by Joseph M. Williams, who does actually seem to have a sense of humor, albeit a dry one.

"One of the great aspects of Williams' book is his approach to organization. The guidelines he provides, for instance, in writing about what's familiar and then what's new, are highly useful. It's one book I enjoy using as a reference." Jack Ehlers
