''I think criticism is a fundamental part of C2. What is bothersome is rudeness delivered with it. One can politely state their opinion without insulting the other's intelligence, mother, and dog.  It is the delivery, not the existence of criticism that is the problem in my opinion. Some unfortunately believe in CriticizeBluntly.''

* What's funny is that people who believe in CriticizeBluntly are always the ones who claim it's their duty to optimize the precious time of everyone on X means of public discourse, and are always the ones who spend most of their waking day in X means of public discourse. -- TheerasakPhotha
