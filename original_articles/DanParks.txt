''Describe DanParks here.''

OK, I will.

DanParks lists himself as ''Daniel J. Parks'' on his resume. He was a graduate student at Miami University (http://www.muohio.edu) in the Department of Systems Analysis (http://www.eas.muohio.edu). In a former life he studied music (classical string bass performance, orchestral stuff), but went back to school to study computer science. After that he began working as a programmer/analyst for a medium-large auto insurance company, then moved on to a smaller auto insurance company owned by a larger auto/home/life insurance company.

On LordOfTheFlies, DanParks asked a question of what people suffering in the OnCampusComputerLab can do to better their programming environments. It will be interesting to see how that file grows...
