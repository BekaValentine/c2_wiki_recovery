Janet Lazar is an Assyrian multi-media artist. She lives in Hollywood with her long-time "lover", KeithCoogan.

I will step in and clarify Janet's presence on Wiki.  She is not a programmer, but she does like the free-form self-editing expression of Wiki.  If there are better places to do this sort of thing (experiment with self expression) let us know.  Thanks.  KeithCoogan

* There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of different Wikis by now; this is merely the first. I would guess that there are in fact other wikis out there with subject matter more to her interest. I personally don't know one way or the other, though; as usual google is your friend. Why is "lover" in scare-quotes?

Maybe we could use JanetLazar as an example case.  Perhaps suggest some other Wiki's here to help her find some others.

There is a sketch on SNL with "lovers", said in the most lurid and suggestive way one can say it... merely a reference.
