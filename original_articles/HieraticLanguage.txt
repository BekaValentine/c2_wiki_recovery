In LivingInaMonument, I was thinking of UnixShell commands: ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, chmod, that sort of thing. But a HieraticLanguage can be any language that fits this mold. Those languages in which simple concepts cannot be expressed with austerity and readability, those nonorthogonal languages where coordinate concepts cannot be expressed simply, those languages that demand concepts be expressed in one and only one way to be expressed at all; these are the HieraticLanguage''''''s.

One test is: can a child learn it? One of Smalltalk's design goals, I think, was the creation of a ProgrammingLanguage simple enough that children could use it for nontrivial tasks.

ThankYou, Mr. Webster! This is exactly what I mean. A HieraticLanguage
is one that is accessible only to the initiates in the mysteries. I
learned Unix by apprenticing myself to a second-year engineering student
and his friends. I suppose this was my introduction as well to the
then-inchoate idea of PairProgramming.
