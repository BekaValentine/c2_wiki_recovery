A free addon for MozillaFirefox and compatible browsers. Uses Firefox's internal SqLite code to open, browse, query, define and export SQLite databases.

A very useful thing to have in your toolbox if you use SQLite at all. Worth keeping Firefox around even if you use another browser.

There's also a plugin for KomodoEdit
