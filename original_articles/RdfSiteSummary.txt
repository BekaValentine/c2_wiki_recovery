''MergeMe somehow with RichSiteSummary, RssFeeds, ReallySimpleSyndication?''

RDF Site Summary (RSS) is a lightweight multipurpose extensible MetaData description and syndication format. ResourceDescriptionFramework (RDF) conforms to the W3C's RDF Specification and is extensible via XmlNameSpace and/or RDF-based modularization. This was the earliest version of the RssFeeds and understood by most ContentManagementSystem type applications, even though it is judged as "market failure" (see RssFeeds).

To use RSS one gets a specific piece of software, gives it a URL, and then things appear in your reader, pulled from the URL supplied. These things are summaries of stuff on the associated Web site, thus giving you summaries of changes.
