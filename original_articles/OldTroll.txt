    [TTTO "OldTroll" by JRR Tolkien]

    Old troll sat athrone in the old folks' home
    type a keyboard, and all grown.
     Thru many a year
     lived in constant fear
    that the winds of change were blowing
     hoeing, snowing
    for many a year lived in constant fear
    that the winds of change were blowing.

    Up came Beck who warn't no Shrek
    offerin a hand up out of heck
     teams far and wide
     all squirm and cry
    their processes weren't working
     lurking, shirking
    teams far and wide they squirmed and cried
    for they knew nothing was working.

    'My lad', thought Troll, 'go jump in a hole'
    code night and day did take its toll
     'I know you're right
     and I see the light
    I'l be damned if I admit it
     pit it, sit it
    I know you're right and I see the light
    I'l be damned if I admit it'

    'That's fine with me, but you will see,'
    said Beck to the troll, 'go Tee Dee Dee
     no a-naly-sis
     will work on this
    you owe it to You to try it.
     Buy it, fly it
    the first is free; the rest gray-vee
    you owe yourself try it.'

    That Troll said, 'See? me smarter than thee
    you can't sell me no anomaly.
     Ward count of three
     won't Tee Dee Dee
    it's a plot to sell books and get famous
     shameless, brainless,'
    repressing his pride deep down inside,
    said, 'all's a plot to get famous'

    But nothing's worse than the old-age curse
    to be set in ways that are all per-verse.
     To know we're right
     is the biggest fright
    he who rails the most won't admit it
     pit it, bit it
    and Troll's still there, on his derriere
    agrees the most, won't admit it.
