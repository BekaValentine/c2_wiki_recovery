'''CDC Cyber'''

The successor to the CDC (ControlData) 6000 and 7000 architectures designed exclusively for high-performance ''scientific'' processing, and relied on discrete semiconductors. Both were designed by chief engineer SeymourCray.

The CDC Star, the first vector-processor, was relabeled the Cyber 200.

The Cyber 170 line incorporated integrated circuits while remaining instruction-set compatible with the 6600 and 7600.

The Cyber 180 series featured a 64-bit word, virtual memory, a predictably full set of ''scientific'' instructions for its traditional market running FORTRAN (FortranLanguage). Contrary to CDC's history, the 180 series included ''commercial'' instructions used especially in Europe, where CDC mainframes sold well to run COBOL (CobolLanguage). The 180 series top-of-the-line was its model 990: a VectorProcessing MainframeComputer, but despite an automatically vectorizing and optimizing FORTRAN compiler, plus a separate object-code optimizer, its performance was reportedly disappointing.

There was also a Cyber 205, produced in a joint venture with EtaSystems.
