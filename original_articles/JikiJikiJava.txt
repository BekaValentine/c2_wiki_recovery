'''Jiki''' is a project that ran from '98 to '99.

It was a distributed component-based implementation of Wiki built under the auspices of the DistributedCoalition.

The source for the Jiki was used as a foundation for several other Java-based Wikis, including DevWiki.  This means that, in some sense, the Jiki was a success.
