InstantGratification is a Post-modern, western society Generation-X mentality and rank amongst one of the most common LifePatterns.

As such, the thinking applies to all aspects of life, fastfood, instant stardom / success, fitness pill, etc.

From '''''MediumIsTheMessage''''', it evolved to '''''PromotionIsTheProduct''''' thinking. And history demonstrated that it has a proven track record, at least for a while.

The IT boom of the last decades of 20th century fit very well with this societal need. Management and developers alike participated in the perpetual search of the NextBigThing.

Except that most societies have grown a bit weary of the bubble mentality. Case of a PatternTooFar. 

But we cannot afford to stop now for fear of implosion, which may well happen, do to a combination of the effects of PeakOil, the CreditCrisisOfTwoThousandEight, and the consequence that the GreatSuburbanBuildout has at long last ended and will probably never start again.


I think that the majority of sociey hasn't grown weary.  It's just that the weary birds of a feather flock together and don't realise how much of a minority they are.  I realized this might be the case when I saw the top 20 ratings (US)  for TV last week:  American Idol, Reality Show 1, Reality Show 2, Reality Show n.  All things I didn't particularly like, and thought were rabidly liked by a ''small'' fanbase and reviled by ''many''.  As it turns out  ''many'' is not a synonym for ''most people I communicate with''.  But I worry too much, don't I deserve a break today. ;)
