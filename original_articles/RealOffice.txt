A quickly fading reality; the RealOffice. At one time in the corporate world, RealOffice was constructed of four walls and a door. The wall material was immaterial; glass, drywall, wood, anything would do. Most RealOffice would have a black board or white board to visualize ideas to yourself and others. By having the RealOffice; it meant you had arrived and had something to contribute.

The RealOffice allowed one to concentrate, converse on the telephone, and have meetings without disturbing others around your PersonalSpace. Your privacy was available in a RealOffice.

Now with the disappearance of the RealOffice, disturbance and no privacy rule the day. Even Executives are not immune to privacy breaches, their assistants sit in a CubeFarm with the Proletariat and conversations are heard with privacy leaks.
