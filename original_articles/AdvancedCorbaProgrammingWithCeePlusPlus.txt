[ISBN:0-201-37927-9] This book has become the "bible" for developing CORBA applications using CeePlusPlus. It is written by two people who have been closely involved with the CORBA standardization process and with the development of widely-used CORBA implementations (Orbacus and Orbix).

Thankfully, and in contrast to several other CORBA-in-C++ guides, this book concentrates on standards, and the examples do not rely on proprietary features of particular ORB implementations. The only major problem is that the book is a few years old, and therefore does not cover any of the newer features of current CORBA standards.  Even so, as an intro to the basics, there is nothing better.
