A ComComponent that has transaction attributes associated with it. In pre-ComPlus days, this would mean registering the component with MicrosoftTransactionServer and marking it with a transaction attribute other than "Does not support transactions". In ComPlus, since MicrosoftTransactionServer has been integrated, it means marking a ConfiguredComponent with a transaction attribute other than "Does not support transaction".
