'''RapidApplicationDevelopment Method''' - ''http://www.gantthead.com/content/processes/11306.cfm''

* ''The RAD method has a task list and a work breakdown structure that is designed for speed. However the major difference in RAD is a set of management techniques that are optimized for speed. Among the most important are:''
** ''Prototyping - an approach based on creating a demonstrable result as early as possible and refining that result. The refinement is based on feedback from the business, the eventual users of the system. Prototyping requires an open approach to development, it also requires an emphasis on relationship management and change management. There are dangers involved in starting prototype development too early and in starting it too late.'' 
** ''Iteration - is a commitment to incremental development based on refinement. Prototyping and iteration go hand in hand.'' 
** ''Timeboxing - is a management technique that focuses attention on delivery above all else. Under a timebox scope can change but delivery cannot.''

'''Defined in the 1980s''' - ''http://en.kioskea.net/contents/genie-logiciel/methodes-agiles.php3''
* ''The Rapid Application Development Method (or RAD) was defined by James Martin in the early 1980s, and consists of a short development cycle based on 3 phases (Requirements, Design and Construction) with an ideal delivery time of between 90 and 120 days maximum.'' 
* ''Online Knowledge defines Rapid Application Development as “a methodology that enables organizations to develop strategically important systems faster while reducing development costs and maintaining quality. This is achieved by using a series of proven application development techniques, within a well-defined methodology.”''
* ''A loose term for any software life-cycle designed to give faster development and better results and to take maximum advantage of recent advances in development software. RAD is associated with a wide range of approaches to software development: from hacking away in a GUI builder with little in the way of analysis and design to complete methodologies expanding on an information engineering framework. Some of the current RAD techniques are: CASE tools, iterative life-cycles, prototyping, workshops, SWAT teams, timebox development, and Re-use of applications, templates and code.
