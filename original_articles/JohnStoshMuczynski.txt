This is August 22, 2001 8:59pm and you are reading my first "new" page of Wiki. (Thanks, by the way.)  As you might guess, my actual first change to a Wiki page was in the WikiWikiSandbox.

If you've linked here from outside of Wiki, you might be wondering "What is Wiki?"  Please see WikiWikiWeb.
