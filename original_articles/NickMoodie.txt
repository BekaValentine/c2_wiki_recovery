Nick Moodie is a bored music student in Norwich. Not necessarily the most likely character to be SwitchingToDvorak but I had nothing better to do.

Nick: Have you tried using Dvorak Assistant to switch your laptop's keyboard? http://clabs.org/dvorak.htm

To get in touch find my link on http://www.highlystrung.org. Don't ring... I think the mobile number is out of date anyway!
