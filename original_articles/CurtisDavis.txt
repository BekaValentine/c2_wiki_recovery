Describe CurtisDavis here.

Brief intro, since I can always edit it later.

63 years old.

West Point Graduate.

Happily married to Lorie for 38 years.  We met at my first duty station after graduation -- Munich Germany.

One daughter, one grand daughter, another grand daughter in utero.  Andrea, my daughter is a Chiropractor with her own practice in Palmdale, CA.  Her husband, Dominick, is a gifted trail lawyer.  He's also the youngest lawyer in the history of the United States to be admitted to practice law before the United States Supreme Court.

Currently working at The Home Depot in the Millworks department.  Interesting work, but the pay is lousy.  Am interviewing for a technical writing job tomorrow.

We live in Newbury Park, CA, part of the city of Thousand Oaks.  We've been in the same house for 20 years now, and never get tired of our view and our community.

More later.
