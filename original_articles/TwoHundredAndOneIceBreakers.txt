Edie West, ''201 Icebreakers: Group Mixers, Warm-Ups, Energizers, and Playful Activities''. Mc''''''Graw-Hill, 1997 [ISBN 0-07-069600-4]

It is possible to buy the set on cards. This implies the right to copy them as handouts to participants. Much more expensive.

The book contains a very good table to help facilitators locate the right ice-breaker for a particular situation. All games are presented in a matrix and marked as 

* Energizing a long, dry presentation
* Especially for big groups
* For non-icebreaker types
* Getting to know you
* Getting to know you better
* Grouping people
* Mental Aerobics
* Outdoor activities
* Physical energizers
* Self-disclosure
* Pure fun

Do I need to tell I grab this book again, and again?
