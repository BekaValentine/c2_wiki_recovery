ObjectStore is the primary product of ObjectDesignInc.  It's an OODBMS that at least in Java, is fairly intrusive into your system.  It seems to have very good performance, though...

Well, I'm not sure what he means by "intrusive".  In some ways yes, in other ways no.

ObjectStore is also a generic term for an object-oriented data store. It is often used in comparison to a DataStore, a generic term for a data source. A canonical ObjectStore offers input and output streams of Object instances.
