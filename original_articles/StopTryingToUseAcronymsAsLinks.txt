In the spirit of OnceAndOnlyOnce, two pages covering a subject which has wasted space and time have been created to cover what some consider to be UgLy. When a familiar Acronym is used as a Link, due to the nature of what WardsWiki recognizes as links, the result looks somewhat unnatural and fabricated. Those who argue PlainEnglish, would rather that the Acronym be spelled out entirely in a WikiWord that looks more conventional. Others argue that the Acronym is more universally recognized and understood than such a word would be. 

So if you are concerned with L''''''inkBeauty, or do not wish to offend those who are, StopTryingToUseAcronymsAsLinks.

If on the other hand if you do not consider that a problem, be prepared for some WikiGnome to post a message of disapproval on any such page.
