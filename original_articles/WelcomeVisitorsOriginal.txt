Welcome to the WikiWikiWeb, also known as WardsWiki or even just "Wiki". A lot of people have their first wiki experience here. This community has been around for a very long time and consists of a large number of people. We are always accepting of newcomers with valuable contributions. If you haven't used a wiki before, be prepared for a bit of CultureShock. The beauty of wiki is in the democratic freedom, simplicity, and power it offers.

This Wiki's primary focus is PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in SoftwareDevelopment. However, it is much more than just an Informal History Of Programming Ideas. It started there, but the theme has created a culture and DramaticIdentity all its own. All Wiki content is WorkInProgress. Most of all, this is a forum where people share ideas! It changes as people come and go. If you are looking for authoritative information, try WikiPedia. All the information here is subjective.

Please read widely on this Wiki before adding new Wiki pages. This helps to reduce unnecessary clutter.

WikiSquatting (using Wiki as personal Web space), WalledGarden''''''s (a series of self-contained pages within a larger wiki), ChatMode (ThreadMode without cleanup), and WikiSpam (commercial advertising) are frowned upon. Religious debates should be avoided. Purely artistic or whimsical stuff goes to GreenCheese.

If you like the wiki concept and want to use a wiki for your own purposes (such as discussing topics other than those mentioned above), please consider the PublicWikiForums, or look at the RunningYourOwnWikiFaq so you can run your own wiki. There are many WikiWikiClones and WikiEngines available. You can get help on ChoosingaWiki if you are overwhelmed by the big list of options.

This is the earliest known wiki, created in 1995.
