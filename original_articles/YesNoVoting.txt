[VotingPatterns]

When a ballot only gives you the set of {Yes, No} to choose from. This causes problems when you are forced to vote because you may not know which one to choose. Even worse, you may not like either one of the chooses at all.

Consequently, YesNoAbstainVoting was invented.

When you have the option of further discussion, RomanEvaluation is an option.
