I'm beginning to think that repeated visits to Yahoo! Finance during work hours is an AlarmBellBehavior? for programmers (kind of like one an AlarmBellPhrase for employers).

Only if they're pulling up their ''own'' company.

A massive order from Amazon containing books that are completely unrelated to the work your team is doing. Shortly before my last team's technical architect quit he received a large set of XP books from Amazon. As the company had just announced that we were adopting RationalUnifiedProcess I think this qualifies as an AlarmBellBehavior.

''It should also set off alarm bells when people leave books like DeathMarch or WhatColorIsYourParachute lying around the office.'' 

Or better yet, ''Soldier of Fortune.''

Other examples:
	* A programmer refuses to let someone else look at what they're working on ("Not until it's finished.")
	* People stop coming into the office during normal working hours, and/or stop showing up for scheduled meetings.
	* A dramatic increase in the amount of "gallows humor" related to the project.
	* Programmers stop doing daily builds or continuous integration because "we don't have time".
	* Managers give orders and developers don't ask any questions about them.
	* Employers give employees contracts to sign "but they're just a formality".
	* Suspiciously well-dressed programmers.
	* When mobile phones appear on every desk and people start popping outside to make or receive phone calls. Or, you hear "I can't talk right now" whenever someone answers a phone.
	* When so many of your team are out finding hidden corners to make secret phone calls that the only place left to make your own secret phone calls is the office.
	* Visiting JobServe.
