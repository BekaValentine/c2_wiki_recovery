One KennethPorter thought of a way-cool name for these diagrams, on news:comp.object :

''I'm drawing up an architecture on a whiteboard for a new multi-processor project (multiple processor types, multiple bus types) and the picture looks a bit like a bento box, with boxes within boxes, and some wires representing communication busses.''

A Bento Box is a Japanese Cuisine lunch box; a box with multiple compartments, and a different tidbit in each one.

Remember, if it's nigiri, etiquette dictates one flips the tid bit before input.
