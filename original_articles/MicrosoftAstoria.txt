The project name of a REST framework which became ADO.NET Data Services Framework (http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/Default.aspx).

When used to expose "data services" (for what else could it be used? after all is purpose should always be to expose data) the way the URLs to call it are written is surprisingly similar to SQL (http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/OnlineService.aspx).

What is the RealDifference beetween MicrosoftAstoria and exposinga SoapWebMethod that receives an SQL query and returns XML ?
