The Calgary Patterns User Group. 

Since we have not had much participation in physical form, it has been relaunched as an electronic discussion group -  Calgary Patterns User Group Discussion Forum. At some point the forum will be moving to a Java implementation with WikiWiki style formatting.

We're dormant while we wait for a new server. MiroslavNovak
