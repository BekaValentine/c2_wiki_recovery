Intershop, http://www.intershop.com,  is a German-based company that makes two products, Intershop 4 and Intershop Enfinity.  

'''Intershop 4 as per their website:'''

''Intershop 4 offers best-in-class hosting and e-commerce functionality allowing you to sell anywhere. The Intershop 4 product line includes ePages, Hosting and Merchant. Together, they provide a logical upgrade path from an entry-level site to and advanced, customizable hosting solution. Each of these solutions come on standard platforms, allowing for quick-deployment, low operating costs, and significant return-on-investment. ''

Technology:
PERL based application server that runs Sybase Adaptive Server on the backend. Very rules intensive.

'''Intershop Enfinity as per their website:'''

''Intershop Enfinity is a packaged sell-side e-commerce application that sits at the heart of your e-business. It provides a quickly deployable, high-performance, scalable and extensible foundation on which to build electronic relationships with your customers and trading partners. ''

Technology:
Java based application server.  Does not come with a backend database, but they recommend Oracle, which a customer has to purchase on their own.

As a side note (and rant), I have developed applications using Intershop 4 and Intershop Enfinity.  I have also been to their training seminars in San Francisco and have interfaced with their technical consulting group.  The seminars are worthless and taught be those who have not even used the product.  Their technical support is the worst I have EVER come in contact with, and Intershop 4 is the most inflexible application I have yet to develop with.  I have only worked with Intershop Enfinity 1.0, and any version 1.0 product has much to be desired. One of the reasons I left my previous employer was that they were an Intershop partner and I could no longer stand developing with the product.  My sympathy to those who use Intershop...
