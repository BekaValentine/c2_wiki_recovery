An IdeaLanguage is a generalization of a PatternLanguage, in which the tokens don't have to be patterns, but can be other forms of idea (see IdeaForm).

''Are there any languages where the "tokens" aren't also ideas?  Aren't all languages "idea languages"?  Isn't this redundant?  Isn't this redundant?''

Seems like it. It seems to be referring to something on IdeaForm that says "Ideas in the soon-to-be-published GemStone Professional Services IdeaLanguage", but of course there are no references to this on the gemstone site.
