This discussion poses the following questions:

Q: Are OffTopic pages Ok, Is any and every topic to be allowed, included and maintained and preserved that a participant wishes to post?

Q: If OffTopic is a working classification, that is is this wiki has a scope and a targeted range of topics which should characterize its content, how does one indicate this to a persistent and determined individual or group while remaining civil?

Q: If Timely subjects such as political and international issues are brought into this forum, and many people become involved and post remarks, should the thread be preserved, archived, deleted, factored to include a hint of relevance, or be provided an alternate place of residence such as another appropriate wiki or blog? 

Q: If such pages in the view of the community are to be allowed, shouldn't a disclaimer such as CategoryOffTopic be attached to the page?

Q: If it is the practice of the community to allow and by participation sanction such pages, should some sort of flag appear in the RecentChanges? (as perhaps in the place of one of the 5 or 6 periods between the title and Url? similar to the present occupation of one of those points by New, or Deleted, Such convention to be established by the community) 

Q: If this wiki has a changed focus such as mentioned and chooses to add a new focus or emphasis, should a page with some sort of indication of what is on and off topic be included in the introductory pages such as FrontPage or RecentChanges, of should any and all persistent posting be allowed and the tag of OffTopic and any sort of guidelines be abandoned?

Other Questions and hopefully some answers are forthcoming: Including that of the Whats, Whens, Wheres and Hows of this convention.
