	 :	Theory Y, on the other hand [as opposed to Theory X, ed.], assumes that individuals do not inherently dislike work, but see it as natural as play or rest. Furthermore, external control and threat isn't the only way to encourage productivity, and the most significant rewards are the "satisfaction of ego" and "self-actualization needs".

For more discussion on TheoryXx and TheoryYy, you might like to take a read of ''Up The Organization'' by Robert Townsend (out of print but can be found through Barnes and Noble book dealers) which can be viewed as a reference manual for the use of Theory Y in a corporation.  He used it while CEO of Avis Rent-A-Car in the 1960s - with some success, by his account.

	 :	Dip into it someplace. If you don't get at least a hollow laugh and a sharpened need to kick that 200-foot sponge you work for, then throw the book away. It's not for you. There are already too many organizational orthodoxies imposed on people, and I don't want to help the walking dead institute another one.

''There's a revised version: Further Up The Organization. Both a bit dated (e.g. his assumptions about women in the workplace) but well worth reading''
