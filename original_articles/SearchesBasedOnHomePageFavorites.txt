If one assumes most links on home pages are favorites, the following two searches would be interesting.

(we define ''home page'' as a page that contains a Category''''''Home''''''Page link.)

'''100 Favorites'''.  Give each page a count of how many times it is referenced by a ''home page''.  List the top 100 such pages, and their counts.

'''Similar Favorites'''.  Give each page a count of how many times it is referenced by a ''home page'', that also references a given page X.  List the top 10 such pages, and their counts.  You are looking for which pages (home page authors who like page X) like. Perhaps this could also be called "If you like this, then you'll like that."

'''100 least favorites''': same "100 Favorites", but list the bottom 100 such pages. Reminiscent of OrphanWikiPages.


I hesitate to edit this page "last edited December 12, 2002 ... made 14 months ago" -- if it's been left alone so long, surely that's because it has already reached perfection, right ?
