PrivateVersioning is a pattern in the ScmPatternLanguage. A summary is: Use Private Versioning to allow you to experiment with complex changes locally, yet still be able to take advantage of the features of a version control system.

You can always create a private branch, but i agree, it would be better
to have checkins that are queued. I've want this feature in perforce
for a while.

That's very easy with GitVersionControl nowadays:

 ''It's similarly easy to do with MercurialVersionControl or any DVCS.  Git is not the only one.'' -EricHopper

 sudo apt-get install git

On project folder, create a repo:
 git init
 git add .
 git commit -am "Initial commit"

Switch to a branch to work on some feature:
 git checkout -b somefeature
 (work work work)

When you get it working, merge and delete the branch:
 git checkout master
 git merge somefeature
 git branch -d somefeature

If you want to loose changes:
 git reset --hard HEAD

etc etc. I'm starting to use this and I really enjoy the flexibility.  -Hugo
