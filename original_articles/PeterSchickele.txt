Peter Schickele is a composer, conductor, and performer of music.
He has recorded several albums as PdqBach.

He currently has a Saturday morning music explanation program
on National Public Radio. http://www.schickelemix.org/

His music has fun with the stodginess of typical classical music, and the pretentions of contemporary music (after all, when ''he'' uses "prepared" instruments, you're ''supposed'' to laugh.)

He is a very funny man, who writes fun classical music.
