AlanRobertson worked for Bell Laboratories for over 21 years. When I left in 2000, I was a distinguished member of technical staff. I went to work for SuSE - the German Linux distributor. When the IPO market soured, SuSE did a bunch of downsizing in the US, so I went to work for IBM's Linux Technology Center in March 2001. I've been working for the IBM since then.  In 2006 I moved out of the
LTC into other activities in IBM.

My main professional interests at this time are HighAvailabilityLinux and ClusteringAPIs.

Like GreggWonderly, I'm a graduate of OklahomaStateUniversity. I got introduced to the Wiki by JimCoplien.

The new Linux-HA web site uses a wiki for content creation, and WikiTransclusion for creating the
pretty public web site.  You can find it here: http://linux-ha.org/ and http://wiki.linux-ha.org/
