No one has provided any thorough examples that this "law" breaks down after about 10 lines of code. I challenge anyone to write a non-trivial, real-world example following this law. I assert that any such example would show to the world once and for all how foolish and wrong-headed the LoD is.

[What is about 10 lines of code? Maybe you can show an example of a violation you think is ok?]

''You're challenging it, you need to show code.  But I'll say I program real world apps on a daily basis and don't break Demeter unless I'm doing a quick hack!''
