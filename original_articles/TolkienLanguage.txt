JrrTolkien has constructed a number of languages to support the variety of races in LordOfTheRings. The elvish languages are perhaps some of the most beautiful constructed languages in the world (I think).

Here is a reference TolkienLanguages : http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/misc/local/TolkLang/

Isn't there a suggestion that the book(s) actually arose as an excuse to work on the languages? I refer you to his essay '''''A Secret Vice'''''

See also: QuenyaLanguage, SindarinLanguage

''There is also a suggestion that WelshLanguage was a source of inspiration for Elvish.'' Finnish, actually.
