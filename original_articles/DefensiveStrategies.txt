Years ago I heard this remark made by a seasoned government employee. He has a very low rank, but managed to have a spectacular success in realestate plays.
* ''"If you don't do anything, you would not be blamed for mistakes."''


Reference:

	* AnyPortInaStorm
	* BlowingTheWhistle
	* WatchYourSix
	* WeAreAllInItTogether
	* GetItInWriting
	* MarryTheFirstSolution
	* NothingWeCanDoIsEnough
	* PearlHarborFile
	* SixtyMinutesFile
	* BlameStorming

Some of these seem to have appeared quite rapidly from RaySchneider. I wonder what has stimulated his thought processes.
