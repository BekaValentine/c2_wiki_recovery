A SmugLispWeenie.

I've been doing software development since 1981. My main programming languages are LispLanguage (various dialects, including my own dialect (see http://web.onetel.com/~hibou/Emblem.html)) and CeeLanguage.

I have also developed in PythonLanguage, PrologLanguage, PascalLanguage, JavaLanguage, AssemblyLanguage and a few others.

I have mainly worked on SystemProgramming and ResearchAndDevelopment, in these areas: interpreters and compilers, ArtificialIntelligence, SpeechProcessing, telecommunications, document processing and a few other areas.

At present, I'm developing (unpaid) a Lisp dialect and environment (Emblem)on top of which I'm developing FullMetalJacket, a graphical DataflowProgramming language (i.e. a relative of PrographLanguage).   I presented a paper on this at the International Lisp Conference 2003.

My main claim to fame (if you could call it that) is that I developed MORSE, a web-based movie recommendation system. This no longer runs, but a paper on it is available at http://www.labs.bt.com/ideas/papers?doc=71147.
