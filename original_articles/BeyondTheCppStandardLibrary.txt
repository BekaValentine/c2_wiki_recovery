This book gives a brief description of all the BoostLibraries in version 1.32.0 and a more detailed discussion of some of them. Although this is by no means the latest version, it gives a good idea of how to take advantage of these libraries in writing CeePlusPlus code. The bibliography is worth reading for the advice on where to go for help with advanced C++. -- JohnFletcher
