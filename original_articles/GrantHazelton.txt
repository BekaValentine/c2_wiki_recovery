I work for Marconi in Liverpool, England, where we mostly write embedded, real-time C and C++ for line-cards and DSLAMs, which connect POTS and xDSL subscribers to ATM networks.

They call me a Senior Software Engineer.

My interest in XP is prompted by a recent, hair-raising experience with 400K+ lines of inherited, very smelly code; and also by concerns about a new project which has no formal requirements or visible customer, but does have a dead-line.
