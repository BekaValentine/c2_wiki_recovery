ThirdWaveDave aka yet another Dave Thomas

'''Occupation''' Licensed and practicing Architect (buildings) living very close to the center of population in the United States, Northwest Arkansas, the heart of "flyover country" and headquarters of the ubiquitous Walmart.

'''Got Here''' On the suggestion of a member of our online philosophical discussion group. We were investigating ways to do just what wiki purports to do, move quickly and easily from discussion or thread mode into a consensus or document mode. Initial objections when suggested to group were lack of security enables any of the "great unwashed" to wipe out previous work.

'''Pet Peeve''' The co-opting of my profession's name by every other person in the world. As in "Architect of War", "Architect of our Education Policy", "Architect of Reform" and the legions of IT, ChiefArchitect, and software "Architects". But then imitation may just be the sincerest form of flattery.

You think you have problems with the title Architect being usurped. You should try being an Engineer.
Just making contact with this Wiki stuff TWD - Regards Ian at http://www.psybertron.org

''RealNamesPlease?'' 
I'd cut Dave some slack for using a monicker - a) it contains his first name, b) his real name is here, and c) his real name is so thoroughly unremarkable that there could be a NameCollision on his real name.
