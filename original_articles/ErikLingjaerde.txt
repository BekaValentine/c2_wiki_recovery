I have 2 activities which combine in a fine way. HAM-radio is a practical approach to my general interest in technology and electronics. Communicating with other HAMs is of course a pleasant thing. But understanding, modifying, experimenting and making things work is much more rewarding.    Sports climbing gives both body exercise and improved skills in antenna work. Imagine hanging in a rope 50 meters above ground and feeling quite safe while doing practical work.   That's a fine combination!
Have a nice day down there.
