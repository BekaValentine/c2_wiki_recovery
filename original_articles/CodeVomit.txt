The code created on a HeroCulture project by heroic coders.

CodeVomit is code churned out thousands of lines at a time, sometimes using CopyAndPasteProgramming, but usually by just brain dumping onto the keyboard. Code''''''Vomit is created because it is believed that the system still does not work because there is not enough code written, therefore more code must be written as quickly as possible in order to meet the deadlines. If the system still does not work, the process iterates. Code''''''Vomit requires ManDay''''''s to create. The more ManDay''''''s you have, the more code you can write. Therefore, extremely large teams of heroic coders are beneficial to the creation of Code''''''Vomit.

Activities such as thinking about the problem consume ManDay''''''s and interfere with the production of Code''''''Vomit, and are therefore frowned upon on truly heroic projects.

''He he, this is so true, I've seen many projects that work exactly like that, unfortunately.''
