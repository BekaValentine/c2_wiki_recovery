From "The Road to Graceland" :

	 :	A practice of any value will be three things:
	1. A way of developing a relationship with the instrument;
	2. A way of developing a relationship with music;
	3. A way of developing a relationship with ourselves.

Fripp may be the author of the following quote found in the liner notes to King Crimson's album ''Discipline'':

	 :	"Discipline is never an end in itself, only a means to an end."
And:
	 :	"Relaxation is never accidental."

Others from elsewhere:
* Money is not a problem, only a difficulty.
* Any fool can play something difficult.
* If we can ask our body to do nothing for half an hour, perhaps we can ask our body to do something for half an hour.
* Listening is how we eat music. Hearing is how we digest it.
* Efficiency: the right amount of the right quality of energy, in the right place at the right time, doing what is right.
* A function of language is to disclose. An effect is to reveal.
