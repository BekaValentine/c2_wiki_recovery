DoomSayers are those people who explain to you why what you are doing successfully can't possibly work, usually by invoking demons from hell.

Sometimes they are right.  Always they are a good hint that you aren't expressing yourself very well.

BertrandMeyer says that reaction to a new methodology goes through 3 stages:
	1 "It's trivial."
	1 "It cannot work."
	1 "The's how I did it all along anyway."
(The order may vary). I think there's a related pattern involving industry hype followed by cynicism and DoomSaying. -- DaveHarris
