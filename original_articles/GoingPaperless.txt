''Going paperless in your home and work life is certainly an admirable ambition. Paper not only costs money in terms of paper and ink, but it clutters up your life and creates confusion. Plus, it’s easily destroyed by fire and water. Digital documents, on the other hand, can be backed up and stored off-site or on the cloud. And they are easy to search, sort and access from anywhere.''

'''''According to Ari Meisel of http://LessDoing.com''''' ''"Being paperless means you’re not only doing good for the environment but you are enabling yourself to live on your own terms, accessing ‘paper’ from anywhere in the world, automating its handling and outsourcing it to those better suited to deal with it so you can focus on the things you really want."''
