BastilleLinux is not actually a LinuxDistribution -- it is a "hardening system" you apply to the RedHatLinux or MandrakeLinux distributions of GnuLinux, with the goal of improving their security. 

	 :	The BastilleLinux Hardening System attempts to "harden" or "tighten" the GnuLinux OperatingSystem. It currently supports RedHatLinux and MandrakeLinux systems. We attempt to provide the most secure, yet usable, system possible.
