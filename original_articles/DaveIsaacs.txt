I am a software developer at Texas Instruments.

I am an active and founding member of the North Texas Patterns discussion/study group. 
For the latest on our group: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NorthTexasPatternsGroup

My current interests are object-oriented software development (http://www.iconcomp.com), patterns and high-performance teams.
