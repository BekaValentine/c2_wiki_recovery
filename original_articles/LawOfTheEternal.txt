The '''law of the eternal''' states that if there even exists the ''possibility'' of something, then that thing '''exists''', ''de facto'', for in the space of '''infinite possibility''' and '''boundless time''', the probability of any proposition reaches 1.0 in the limit and exists '''at once'''. However, like the vast field of irrational numbers, the probability of finding it may be zero. However, for those things which have value among many or otherwise encodes many shared values, its probability of existence at any moment or otherwise ''finding it'' rises.

''Note bene'': The philosophical question of "Does it exist before it is imagined?" must remain in the realm of the '''unknowable'''.

Two notes when referring to such an enigmatic metaphysical concept:
* The usage of the word "possibility" above is a convenience within the context of '''time''', for in the aforementioned space where all is held *at once*, '''All''' simply '''Is'''; i.e., time is a ''construct''.
* Contradictory propositions held "at once" are simply held orthogonally to each other (not unlike how imaginary numbers are held independently from the real numbers), so there is no real "logical problem".

Perhaps the most significant application of this Law (and result?) is in answer to the question of the existence of God. If it is possible that there could be a perfect formulation of the Universe (akin to a unified TheoryOfEverything), then it should surely have been created, discovered, or ''embodied'' by '''now''' "somewhere".

Compare as a more specific formulation of Plato's Realm of Ideals.
