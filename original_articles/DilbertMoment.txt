The moment you realise that DilBert isn't satire but reportage.
----
A "DilbertMoment" is coined after that luckless inhabitant of cubicle hell, Dilbert.
It describes the feeling you get in a situation (usually associated with a large company or project, and best felt when surrounded by a huge cubicle grid) when a sudden sensation comes over you that makes you feel you must know what it is like to be Dilbert.

For all the foreign object consultants living in Switzerland, from Dilbert Future:

"How Super-Smart-Land Would Be
* They would be neutral in all wars.
** Of course, being surrounded by mountains helps.  Belgium wanted to be neutral in WWII, and we know what happened to them...
* Their clocks would be very, very accurate.
** Until the entire industry gets whacked upside the head by a now-obvious DisruptiveTechnology like quartz crystals...
*** Clarification question: how are quartz crystals DisruptiveTechnology?
* They would have the highest standard of living
* They would have excellent chocolate.
* Their pocketknives would be extraordinary.
** Give me a LeathermanTool any day of the week...
** ''Actually they'd probably use Gerber knives instead of Leatherman tools''

(...) After years of inbreeding, the super-smart people have evolved into skinny, gray creatures with huge eyes. They wear makeup to look like stern Germans when tourists are around.

'''Prediction 19''' In the future we'll all realize that the creatures we thought were from other planets are actually smart people who live in Switzerland."
