SoftwareEngineer, long time WikiLurker, in awe of this amazing web experiment

big fan of MacApp. 

IMHO, this is a much under-rated framework, (getting a bit long in the tooth now).
----
Not a big fan of BigDesignUpFront, big fan of ProperPriorPlanningPreventsPissPoorPerformance

How do you strike the right balance between too much planning and not enough planning ??

Categorization experiment.

Lately its occurred to me that there should be more links here to pages I want to keep an eye on. But how to organize them?
A large volume on my desk is a copy of "TheComputerScienceAndEngineeringHandbook". I've always liked the way it breaks down the subject matter into sections. 

	* 1 - Algorithms and Data Structures 
	* 2 - Architecture 
	* 3 - Artificial Intelligence and Robotics 
	* 4 - Computational Science
	* 5 - Database and Information Retrieval
	* 6 - Graphics 
	* 7 - Human-Computer Interaction
	* 8 - Operating Systems and Networks
	* 9 - Programming Languages
	* 10 - Software Engineering
