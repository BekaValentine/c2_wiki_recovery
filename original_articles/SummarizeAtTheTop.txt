'''Solution:''' When creating a new page here, consider adding a one-line summary at the top. 

'''Pattern Category:''' CategoryWikiEditing

'''Discussion:'''
* I thought this was going to be an AntiPattern where you write a real nice detailed summary of a project or code at the top, then give sparse or nonexistant comments everywhere else. Making it easy to get an overall picture but hard to figure out how the heck the programmer implemented it. Anyway, I find it interesting that there is no 1-line summary at the top of this page...
*''This page is presented using a PatternForm which does not require, nor necessarily benefit from, a summary at the top.''
* It would not be harmed if it did! I have added one. -- DonaldNoyes
