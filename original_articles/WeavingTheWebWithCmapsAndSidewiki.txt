The Web as we know suffers under a chronic disease, the architecture is built on unidirectional links.
If our brain would be built on unidirectional links, I guess we would be unable to even process thought, merely do simple reactions.
However TimBernersLee envisioned a bidirectional architecture.

What about using ConceptMaps in tandem with GoogleSideWiki as a workaround?

Everybody here, who feels to contribute to build a friendly GlobalBrain is invited to start this endeavor on this page :-)

Our brains ''are'' built on unidirectional links.  Brains are constructed from networks of neurons, where an axon terminal of one neuron links to a dendrite of another neuron.  Signal processing travels in one direction from dendrites to axon terminals.
