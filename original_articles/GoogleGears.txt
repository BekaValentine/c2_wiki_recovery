The latest nail in the coffin of ThinClients:

There are several major API components to Gears (from WikiPedia):

* A Database module (powered by SQLite) that can store data locally (See NimbleDatabase).
* A WorkerPool module that provides parallel execution of JavaScript code.
* A LocalServer module that caches and serves application resources (HTML, JavaScript, images, etc)
* A Desktop module that lets web applications interact more naturally with the desktop.
* A Geolocation module that lets web applications detect the geographical location of their users.

Can anyone honestly say, that after eating this 10000 KiloCalories, WebBrowsers as ThinClients still have a future?
