A logic analyzer records digital electrical signals.  
Recording (sampling) is either...

	* ''Synchronous'' with some other signal, typically a clock or strobe
	* ''Asynchronous'' sampling a regular intervals controlled by an internal time base

The most outstanding diagnostic features of a logic analyzer
are ...

	* ''Pre-trigger'' view of signals leading to a TriggerEvent
	* ''Channel Width'' large enough to view many signals, including busses

Logic analyzers are improved when they are made 
LongerWiderFaster, all attributes of their memory.
Equally important are sound MechanicalProbe design 
and SamplingElectronics.  Fancy information processing seems to 
just get in the way.  With complicated controls one is often 
left DebuggingTheDebugger.

A StripChartRecorder may be slow and narrow, but it sure
is long.
