A WikiHive is like a WikiFarm, with the difference that instead of creating a bunch of separated and isolated wiki, a WikiHive seeks to assemble Wiki into a collective, where all interact in unison. The first known WikiHive is the TaoRiver wiki, set up in early 2004, which includes the PlogDev, SymbolProject, WikiFutures, and VisualWiki.
