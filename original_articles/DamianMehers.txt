Technical Areas of expertise: Java, COM/DCOM, C++, CORBA

Started programming in 1981 on the Sinclair ZX81, and because of the limitations of programming a machine with 1K of memory in BASIC was forced into Z80 assembly.

Next got a BBC Model B computer (32K memory, 6502).  Spent a lot of time trying to crack the protection on games in order to get infinite lives.  This is where I really got to grips with programming - I am comfortable dropping into assembly code or other "low level" stuff; later came in great use trying to understand some poorly documented aspects of the DCOM network protocol from network dumps

Went to North Staffs Poly (now Staffordshire University) for a degree on Computing Science with French, and did a year with DEC (RIP) near Geneva as part of the course.

After graduating spent two years with Logica in the Netherlands and learned an enormous amount about how to write good software and a very little Dutch.

Back to DEC for a year, then contracting for a couple of years in Bern, Switzerland, back to DEC as a Systems Integration consultant, taught Java, did all kinds of Middleware consulting.

Quit and founded Linar a year and a half ago.  Spend my time mixed between supporting J-Integra customers, developing new features, and managing Linar.  Travel a lot, balanced pretty much equally between the UK, Ireland and the US.
