A large network visualization program. Originally designed for studying biology models, it is usable for anything GraphViz is.

Unfortunately, it's written with the BoostLibraries for CeePlusPlus, which tends to be a moving target with respect to the version of Boost as well as the compiler version. It dies horribly with multiple errors when attempting to build with recent versions of GnuCpp, even with its recommended version of boost. GraphViz's ability to work out of the box can't be overestimated... unfortunately, it's largely unsuited for the task that LGL would appear to tackle. Know of anything else like LGL that works?

''There's Gephi (http://gephi.org/), but neither it nor anything else I've found adequately handle the 500K-node graph I want to visualise.  I may have to create something that can effectively display BigData and manipulate it in real time.''
