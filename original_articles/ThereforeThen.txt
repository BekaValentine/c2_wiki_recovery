A humble attempt to follow in the footsteps of ThereforeBut, the most elegant pattern form. Observe that patterns are most useful when they form part of a PatternLanguage; further, they are even more useful when they suggest another potential pattern. After all, as patterns don't exist in isolation, their applied solutions similarly are connected as a sequence of steps.

'''Therefore,'''

Succinctly present the resolution, as with ThereforeBut. Consider the pattern as the pattern it is.

'''Then,'''

Recount further actions or patterns that typically would occur after the current pattern in a section marked by a bold "'''Then.'''" In other words, answer, "What's next?" Then connect these as new patterns to build the complete system of patterns.
