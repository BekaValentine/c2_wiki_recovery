Been watching a certain Wiki contributor for the last few weeks. Reminds me of that old movie ForbiddenPlanet. What this person does is post OffTopic and without GoodStyle - generally ThreadMode stuff. Then when various people object he accuses them of all being one person, and imagines that one person is some kind of monster hounding him.

Good example is FlamingPages. If you look at the PageHistory you can see that no fewer than 4 different people had much the same reaction to this guy. Now if you look at his reaction you'll see he thinks there's someone out there with a million different IPs hounding him.

''You do realize, that if you are correct, this page will only feed the problem?''

Yeah, but what else can we do with him? ''Read MrId.''

''For the patient: continual gentle guidance.''

''For those that think it's a lost cause or simply don't want to become involved: WuWei.''
