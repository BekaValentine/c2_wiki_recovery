Velocity is a Java-based template engine FrameWork. It permits anyone to use the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code. 

When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or PHP. 

Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of the web; for example, it can be used to generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more information on XML transformations) from templates. It can be used either as a standalone utility for generating source code and reports, or as an integrated component of other systems. For instance, Velocity provides template services for the Turbine web application framework, together providing a view engine facilitating development of web applications according to a true MVC model.
