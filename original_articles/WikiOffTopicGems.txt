While WiseWordsWrittenOnThisWiki is mostly WikiOnWiki, this is a page on OffTopic pages that are like hidden gems that turn up during house cleaning. They sparkle and catch the corner of your eye, often when you get just too tired through concentrating on serious work too long. And would go away unnoticed for years, if you did not reclaim them when rediscovered.
** Unfortunately sometimes some gems got swept away into the bin with other rubbish as well.

Unclassified but definitely Gem quality

* OdeOnaGrecianUrn - it is in a walled garden, I do not understand it due to my poor English, but it is fascinating. Moreover, it has been here a long time so others must have liked it.
** ''A very long time indeed - since 1819: http://englishhistory.net/keats/poetry/grecian.html''
* PoetryInSandbox

Not quite gemstone but these older pages can release hidden creative energy, useful diversion from programming

* SexEcologyandSpirituality
* LlanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwyllLlantysiliogogogoch
* PoemsParodyAndFilkRoadMap
* BooksThatHaveShapedPeoplesLives
* TimeForaParadigmShift

Good pages in the twilight zone between OnTopic and OffTopic

* WhatLedUpToTheMindWipe
