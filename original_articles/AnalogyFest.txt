AnalogyFest is an event at the AgileDevelopmentConference. It's a place for people to get together and talk about carefully worked through analogies between software development and something else. We don't care much about whether the analogies are ''true'' - we just want them to be useful in sparking ideas that people can try out on their projects. For more, see http://www.visibleworkings.com/analogyfest/.
