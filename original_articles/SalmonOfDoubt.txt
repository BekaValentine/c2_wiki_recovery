ISBN: 1400045088, By DouglasAdams

----
A book synthesized from the recovered works of DouglasAdams.  It came to publication in some measure through the efforts of his long-time friend, Christopher Cerf, who writes the book's foreword.

It contains a number of isolated writings and transcripts, giving considerable insight into the man.

The latter half (third?) of the book is the beginnings of a story he started to write called "Salmon Of Doubt."  It begins with an event experienced largely through the perceptions of a rhinoceros. The story 

is never finished due to the tragic death of Douglas Adams.
