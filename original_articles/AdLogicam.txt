AdLogicam is one of the FallaciousArgument''''''s where it is asserted that because an argument contains a fallacy, the conclusion must be false.

''The rest of this page is no longer talking about AdLogicam ...''

Some teminology. Given a statement P-->Q:

* P is the antecedent
* Q is the consequent
* The inverse is ~P-->~Q
* The converse is Q-->P
* The contrapositive is ~Q-->~P

* P->Q  <=>  ~Q->~P
* P->Q  <=/=>  Q-> P

None of this has anything to do with AdLogicam.
