I found my way in here (wiki) while trying to learn more about ExtremeProgramming. Some of my most successful--and most enjoyable--work has has included parts of ExtremeProgramming.

I live and work in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. I'd like to find others in the Pittsburgh area who are interested or doing Extreme Programming.

I'm currently working for Vivisimo. Vivisimo has embraced many agile methodologies, which is great fun.

I find I have trouble writing about myself in the third person!
