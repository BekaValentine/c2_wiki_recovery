A WindowManager for Linux/Unix with TiledWindows. You configure it by editing an include file and recompiling. The entire project is less than 2000 LOC so this is not an arduous task. It used to display its StandardIn stream in its status line, but more recent versions use the name attribute of the root window for this. This way you can change the display using xprop instead of running a deamon process
