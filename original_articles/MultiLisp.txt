Multilisp is the language that introduced FutureValue''''''s. It supports only SharedStateConcurrency, unlike some other languages with futures/promises (such as EeLanguage and JouleLanguage) that support MessagePassingConcurrency. The paper referenced above argues against MessagePassingConcurrency, but its arguments are weak and do not apply to Joule or E.
