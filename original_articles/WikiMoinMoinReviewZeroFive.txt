'''General Notes'''

''Adding Attributes''

''Please use the same attributes and the same sequence of attributes in each review.  If you add an attribute to one review, please consider adding it at the same location in each review, the WikiEngineReviewTemplate, and the WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated.''

''Reviews of New Releases''

''Please maintain separate reviews for each version of each WikiEngine. The intent is to maintain reviews of old versions of software that might still be in use on a WikiFarm or on a specific WikiSite??. See WikiEngineReviewNewRelease for the recommended approach.''

''Notes''

See WikiEngineReview, WikiEngineReviewNotes, and WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated for notes and discussion about these reviews and Wikis in general.

----
'''General'''

	* ''Date of Review:'' 25 November, 2000

	* ''Software and Version Reviewed:'' MoinMoin Release 0.5 (features in the current development version carry a [0.6] tag)

	* ''Review Summary:''

	* ''Review Quality:'' Basic technical info

	* ''Standard Features Missing:''

----
'''Software'''

	* ''Server OS:'' Any (though you probably will have a hard time on MacOS)

	* ''Language:'' Python

	* ''Database:'' File system (later versions might require a DB engine for more sophisticated features)

	* ''Required Software:'' 
		* Python (1.5.2 or 2.0)
		* CGI-capable web server (known configurations: Apache 1.3.x on Windows and Unix; MS-IIS 4.0)
		* On Windows, you need a diff utility (the cygwin package, available from http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/download.html)

	* ''License:'' GPL

----
'''WikiFarms'''

	* ''Name / cost / limits / URL:'' None known.

----
'''Content'''

	* ''Display original Wiki text?'' Yes (I assume, no detailed check; definition lists using "TAB label TAB: description" are definitely missing though); test page: http://purl.net/wiki/moin/WikiTextFormattingTestPage

	* ''Text editing rules:'' Extended Wiki markup (http://purl.net/wiki/moin/HelpContents); MoinMoin has pluggable parsers, so you can add any markup system.

	* ''Headings?'' Yes (using "= header =" markup, up to 5 levels; support for table of contents).

	* ''Allowable WikiNames:'' Literally any (default is Latin-1 with 0-9 regarded as lowercase letters, the character sets for uppercase and lowercase are configurable; special markup allows any sequence of characters to be a wiki name, thus there are quite a few Japanese MoinMoin wikis).

	* ''Subpages?'' No (planned extension).

	* ''Max Page Size:'' Browser limitation only.

	* ''Tables?'' Yes (using StructuredText markup).

	* ''Images?'' Yes.

	* ''Attachments?'' No, but embedded external links.

----
'''Readability'''

	* ''Search capabilities:'' Title index, word index, title search, full-text regex search, goto pagename, embedded lists of pages conforming to a regex pattern.

	* ''Email notification of changes:'' Not yet, soon to come.

	* ''Diffs:'' Yes, for all pages in the history against the current page.

----
'''Security'''

	* ''Embedded HTML (risky):'' No, but can be added very easily as a parser if wanted.

	* ''Password protection?'' No (planned extension).

	* ''Delete Pages?''

	* ''Revision Snapshots?'' Yes, full history.

	* ''Rollback:'' Not automatic (manually from the history using diff, see also below for the "raw" feature).

	* ''Delete Snapshots?''

----
'''Working Well with Others'''

	* ''Static or dynamic web pages:'' Dynamic.

	* ''Indexed by search engines?'' By default, MoinMoin emits a <META NAME="ROBOTS" CONTENT="NOINDEX,NOFOLLOW"> element (configurable).

	* ''InterWiki Links?'' Yes, with support for UseMod's interwiki list

	* ''Import / Export Features:'' On the OS level, the pages files can be copied, tar'ed, etc. For example, the MoinMoin wiki itself is put under CVS control in addition to the built-in versioning.

	* ''Translators to/from other Wikis?'' Not built-in, but possible by the parser/formatter mechanism used to parse and emit pages.

----
'''Miscellaneous'''

	* ''Extra Features:'' "fancy" links, user preferences [0.6], inline code and code displays, graphical smileys, page redirects, table of contents within a page [0.6], "printable" version of page (excluding headers, editing links, ...), "raw" page text (get the wiki markup as text/plain), numbered lists with different styles (numeric, roman, alpha) and start values [0.6].

	* ''References:''
		* http://purl.net/wiki/moin/FrontPage

	* ''Browsers Used:''
		* The development version is checked against IE 5.5

	* ''Comments by Users:''
		*  I've been using MoinMoin for my own stuff... and I really like it. It's well documented, full featured, easy to use, and I found it very easy to modify when I wanted to add a feature. Thanks JuergenHermann, for making this available! -- MichaelChermside
