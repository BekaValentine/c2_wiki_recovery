Data should be free to flow on the web; this enables it to be combined, linked and joined in ways that can't be foreseen in advance. We can make possible the free data flow using the RestArchitecturalStyle combined with the AngleBracketedUnicodeText family of standards (ExtensibleMarkupLanguage a.k.a. XML, XsltLanguage a.k.a. XSLT, XPath, XPointer, XInclude, XLink, XHTML & ScalableVectorGraphics) combined with the HyperTextTransferProtocol (HTTP) and URIs. Also, there exists the possibility to overlay the data with semantic meta data, for example with TopicMaps or RDF.
