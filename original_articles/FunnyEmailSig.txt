It's amazing how an EmailSignature has become such a great medium for ''humor''.  Who would have thought?

* First off, signatures originated with Usenet posting software and spread to email from there, back in the 1980s.
* Secondly, what do you mean "become"? Signatures have been humorous since about the third one in existence.

For levity, or to earn points on SlashDot, enjoy perusing and borrowing:

* There ain't no rules here; we're trying to accomplish something. 
* Opinions expressed here are my employer's and not necessarily mine. 
* Microsoft's business model 1. Profit. 2. Profit???? 3. Profit. 
* From the Committee to Re-Elect the President: "Don't change horsemen, mid-apocalypse." 
* Have you ever thought about just turning off the TV, sitting down with your kids, and hitting them? ''Source attributed to futurama:bender''
* Never argue with an idiot, they only drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.
* Very funny, Scottie. Now beam down my clothes.
* Don't anthropomorphize computers. They hate that. 
* There are 10 types of people in this world... those that understand binary, and those that don't. 
* Waht? Tehr's a ''preveiw'' buottn? 
* I'm not normally an irrational zealous dickhead, but I figure "When in Rome..." ''(sorry for the rude submission, but it's ''so'' applicable to almost ''every'' form of internet discourse)''
* (In a similar vein): Arguing on the Internet is like running in the Special Olympics. Even if you win you're still retarded.
* My operat~1 system unders~1 long filena~1, does yours?
* If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to contact your brain.
* I'm a paranoid. I once tried to cure myself and therefore tried to join ParanoidsAnonymous. But they didn't let me know where the meetings were.
* "Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society." -- MarkTwain
* Unix is a very user-friendly system -- it's just not promiscuous about which user it's friendly with.

It's interesting seeing the evolution of signatures on Slashdot, where the majority of the posters are not familiar with them from Usenet. I.e., its evolution on Slashdot parallels its evolution on Usenet. ''Except that SlashDot limits you to 120 chars and enforces a sig marker, so it ducks a lot of the flame wars and WarLord''''''ing that UseNet has seen.''
