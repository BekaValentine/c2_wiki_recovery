[Part of the NegotiatingPatternLanguage]

In many negotiations, the consideration transferred from one party to another is not paid as a lump sum; instead it is paid over time.  In some cases, such as job-hunting; the considerations in ''both'' directions are on an over-time basis (I work a week and get a weeks pay); in other cases (such as purchases on credit) the buyer receives the goods up front, but pays the seller off in installments.

With this in mind, a crafty seller can often get a better deal, by focusing on the amount of each ''installment'', rather than on the price of the total package.  Many advertisements for consumer products ranging from televisions to computers to automobiles don't list the total price, but instead list the monthly payment (under the assumption that the vendor will provide the financing).  Sometimes, this can be used to get a customer to accept what otherwise would be a bad deal.

This is especially true when the customer is not in a position to pay cash for the item--either he finances the purchase, or he goes without.

Ways to deal with sellers or others who attempt to SellThemOnThePayment:

* If you can, pay up front.  
* If you need financing, arrange it separately.  Financing offered through a bank or credit union is generally a better deal than financing offered through a vendor.
* Make sure, in either case, you know the full price.  (But remember to consider TimeValueOfMoney...if you can arrange to defer payments but not increase the amount due, that's to your advantage).
* Be wary of too-good-to-be-true financing offers; chances are other terms of the deal are to your disadvantage (see GetThemOnTheTradeIn).
