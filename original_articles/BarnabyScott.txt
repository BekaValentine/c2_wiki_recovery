In recent years I have written a couple of ludicrously over-elaborate database applications for my own use and/or amusement
* Ok, that intensely provokes my curiosity, can you list them and say what is "ludicrously over-elaborate" about them??? -- DougMerritt
* P.S. I see no edit buttons, even in the SandBox, on MonkeyWiki, and tacking "?action=edit" onto the page name just provokes an error message that I'm not allowed to. Yet the SandBox seems to have been used.

** ''From: http://www.waywood.co.uk/MonkeyWiki/InstallationInstructions.html  "EDITABLE = 0 will make the site impossible to edit, otherwise put 1."  I believe the wiki was made un-editable on purpose.''
** Yes that's right - I did make it read-only while I was away on holiday because it kept getting hammered by spam. I have since put some spam-protection in place, but as yet I have no evidence of how effictive it is. The spam seems to have dried up on its own for now!
