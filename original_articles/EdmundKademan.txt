I am not really a software engineer but a statistician with
a deep interest in computer programming.  When I first
discovered object-oriented and pattern technologies my
reaction was that they were a lot of fancy, computer sciency
ideas that were relevant only for IT professionals, but the
more I learn about programming the more I have come to
appreciate them.  In many ways the pattern community bears
the same relation to the software hacking culture that the
statistics profession bears to the more undisciplined and
ad-hoc fringes of the machine learning world, namely, it
provides a sensible way of arriving at interpretable
results.
