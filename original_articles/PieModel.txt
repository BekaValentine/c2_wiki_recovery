The PieModel is a mental model that allows you to perform tasks. I developed the model because I wanted to make sure that I and others perform tasks in an organized manner.

It has three basic phases: '''P'''lanning, '''I'''mplementation, and '''E'''valuation.  (sort of before you do the task, while you do the task, and after you do the task).

Here's how I use it:

	1 I know that there are different mental modes to each phase.  In the '''P''' mode I have to be creative, think about all the options, generate some new ones, think about pitfalls, pros and cons, etc.  In the '''I''' mode I need to be aggressive in following the plan, not get distracted, make sure my plan is logical, and be result oriented.  In the '''E''' mode I have to be reflective, really think about what I was doing, generate lessons for the future.

	1 The '''PIE''' is recursive because each phase may include internal '''PIE'''s. I have to plan the '''P''', implement the '''P''', and evaluate the '''P'''. Each phase may include several '''PIE'''s. The '''I''' part may include 3 subparts each with a whole '''PIE''' in it.

	1 The '''PIE''' is especially good when you communicate to yourself or others what you are now doing. If you are in '''P''', or '''I''' or '''E''' you expect different kinds of inputs.

If you have more ideas or questions about this let me know.

'''PIE''' seems to be an abbreviated version of the SystemsMethod.
