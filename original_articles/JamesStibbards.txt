My name is James Stibbards.  I live in Northern VA, used to work as a Sr. Security Consultant at Cigital.

I'm currently working for Cloakware, doing technical pre-sales in software security and obfuscation technology.

In another lifetime, I worked on Multics for Honeywell (see http://www.multicians.org/thvv/), and in a more recent life, was an Consulting Analyst for Tandem Computers (now Compaq...er... HP... whatever)

My interests include security, knowledge management, searching and linking technologies, and visualization, and 
oh - model aircraft design.  I can be reached by mailto:stibb@ai.mit.edu.
