Designed to be easily adaptable to other test suites.

Test cases are either free void functions
or classes with a test() method.  

The TestCollector script simply greps for simple patterns
of each, and creates a .c file that builds a testsuite.
That testsuite can use any test framework you like,
such as CppUnit.  I.e. my stuff can be considered
just a simple interface to CppUnit, although it also 
works with other test frameworks.

* Sorry, I work or have worked for companies that make it difficult to make code public. I nevertheless hope that simply describing it may be useful to others.

* I have been using this framework "in production" since 1996.

* Latest addition: the script that greps and counts events such as "TEST STARTED", "TEST PASSED", and "TEST FAILED" has been made into a GUI widget using Python/Tk. Thanks Hank Pellerin!
