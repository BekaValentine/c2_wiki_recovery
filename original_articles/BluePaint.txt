A BluePaint algorithm is one that marks off each record as it processes it. In most cases, a cleanup routine removes the BluePaint afterwords. This is a good case for using try/finally.

I usually note which records have been processed in a separate list.  This requires no modification to the visited nodes, allows multiple concurrent visitors (assuming they coordinate otherwise on changes), and eliminates the need for a cleanup routine.  Is such an approach an alternative way to implement BluePaint or is it a different algorithm altogether? -- CraigPutnam

** BluePaint is not thread safe. That is the alternate algorithm for when thread safety is required. Consider that GarbageCollector''''''s cannot use that mechanism.

*[I'm guessing that it is a metaphor based on the bluing used in metalworking.  That bluing is used to make designs, or can be applied and then designs are etched into it, etc.]
*Considering the age of BluePaint as an algorithm description (1960's at least) that sounds like a good guess.
