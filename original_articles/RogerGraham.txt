Hi.  I am a developer using Borland Delphi, Paradox writing database systems, file-server & client server.  My background is Chemistry and I'm interested in architecture.  I'm fascinated by the synergy between different disciplines and the recent discovery of Carbon 60 is one that unites my two areas of interest.

I'm interested in anything which reduces the amount of hard work in developing systems, new paradigms in the interaction with users that drive system development.

Keep it simple, do less and accomplish more ....

There has to be some simple framework (pattern?) that can be used for system development that reduces the development time and makes for more robust systems.

I will read and await with interest.
