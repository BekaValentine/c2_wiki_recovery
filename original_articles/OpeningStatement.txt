In WhyWikiWorks, it is described how the various forces of the 'net (and WikiPlayers) at large coalesce to make the Wiki system work, when it does. This view appears to be rather utopian in nature. In WhyWikiWorksNot, it is described how strife often occurs (and the system breaks down) when things don't seem to follow a relatively well-ordered cycle structure of creation/ThreadMode/DocumentMode.
