ObjectSchemaMethodology is a XmlSchemaMethodology that consistently models information and its relationship to other objects.

----

In a data world, CascadeAll or CascadeDelete such that the information makes no sense outside the context of the parent.

The following XML is produced when extracting from the two tables PERSON(id,name,age) and PERSON_ADDRESS(person_id,role,line1,line2,line3,code) tables and would potentially be modelled as the following if there are only two roles for home and work.

<Person>
        <Id>90210</90210>
	<Name>Jack</Name>
	<Age>25</Age>
        <HomeAddress>
             <Line>1 Smith Street</Line>
             <Line>Pretoria</Line>
             <Code>0001</Code>
        </HomeAddress>
        <WorkAddress>
             <Line>15 Clonmore Road</Line>
             <Line>Bryanston</Line>
             <Code>2021</Code>
        </WorkAddress>
</Person>

----

Relationships that are not CascadeAll or CascadeDelete are typically referenced via a reference to the object instead of embedding the entire objects structure.

An example would follow as:

<Sale>
   <Id>101020203</Id>
   <Date>2009-05-30</Date>
   <Person>15</Person>
</Sale>
