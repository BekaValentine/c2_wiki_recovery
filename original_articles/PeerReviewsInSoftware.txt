''Peer Reviews in Software: A Practical Guide'',
by Karl E. Wiegers. [ISBN: 0201734850].

The book includes a chapter on peer programming. Karl seems to be a decent guy from the talks I've heard him give, although I have heard him make factually-challenged comments on extreme programming once or twice. Ironically, Ward made some comments in a presentation in that very same room two days before that directly contradicted his comments.
