Walk into a bar and up to a suitable partner. Say to them, "So, you wanna go do a little PairProgramming back at my house?" 

And then they say "Go refactor yourself"

..or they say.. "Hey! I'm trying to ''decrease'' coupling."

"I'm work in software, but I play in rubberwear!"  ''(so you're into ExtremeProgramming?)''

"Well, it's impossible to get rid of ''all'' bugs..."

"I may ''work'' for Microsoft, but I'm megahard!"

"I may ''work'' with Unix, but I'm no eunuch."

"Somebody stole all my database books. Now I'm looking for a new Date..."

"You're one well-written subroutine.  Can I call you sometime?"
