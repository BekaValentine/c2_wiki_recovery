According to the band, they settled on the name Jethro Tull for no reason other that that's the name (out of many) that they were performing under, when they started to get popular.  Before that, they'd change names whenever they found themselves unable to get gigs; reinvented as a "new" band, they thus got to play all the local clubs all over again before the managers thereof figured out what was up.
