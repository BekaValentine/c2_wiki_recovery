What we did:

	* NMock - SteveFreeman, OwenRogers, JimArnold and JoeWalnes added some finishing touches - version 1.0 is now ready! We also discussed some ideas for the next version including MockCall decorators (like the Java MockObject''''''s project), NUnit integration, auto verification, enhanced constraints and how to mock *anything* using the C++ profiler API.
	* Martathon + AltRMI - Tried to get our heads around Java. What does System.out.println() do?
