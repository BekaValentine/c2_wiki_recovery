These are some good ProfilerTool''''''s to use when you're optimizing later:

	* AlphaworksJinsight
	* CompuwareDevPartner
	* EclipseProfilerPlugin
	* HyadesProject (now Test & Performance Tools Platform: http://www.eclipse.org/tptp/index.html)
	* OptimizeIt
	* PerfAnal (free HPROF cpu=samples summarizer)
	* SitrakaJprobe
	* use the -Xprof option, it is good enough in some cases
	* RationalCompany's Quantify (supports C++ & Java)
	* DevStream's JView 2004 (http://www.devstream.com/jview2004)
	* JProfiler (http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)
	* HPjmeter (http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/java/hpjmeter/)

Alternatively you can just write your own simple profiler using the Java Virtual Machine Profiler Interface (JVMPI).

	 :	''But I wouldn't.  It's about to be replaced by JSR163 - http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=163  -- PaulMclachlan''

It was kinda simple, in its own way, to be able to write C code that got notified about every method call.  And then you could profile without slowing down the JVM much at all.  Hopefully JSR163 won't turn into another bloated Java API.

'''Profilers that are suitable for PDA's?'''
I tried to find the profilers which can run on PDA's and profile the java applications running on them in many forums and websites , but i could not get the information i needed.
Although many profilers exist in market,i just wanted to know which one is good for profiling on pDA's?

Please help me in this regard.

'''Open Source Java Profilers'''

	1 java -Xrunhprof:cpu=old ... then read the generated profiler data using Rolf's Profiler Viewer http://www.squarebox.co.uk/download/profiler/
	2 java -Xrunhprof:cpu=samples,threads=y using PerfAnal

''Rolf's Profiler Viewer looks like a nice tool, but it hasn't been maintained since 2001. Is there a newer version that works with cpu=samples instead of cpu=old? Are there any other free front ends to HPROF? -- IanOsgood''

''HPjmeter (http://www.hp.com/products1/unix/java/hpjmeter/) is another free front end to HPROF.  It works with cpu=samples and has some decent documentation''
