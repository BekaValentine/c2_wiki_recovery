'''Linux, Java and Video'''

I recently bought a wireless camera from x10.com. It came with a VCR commander and a couple of motion sensors. 
Those things are supposed to work together. 
But i thought that making it work with my linux box would have been a better way to handle it...

'''Install the frame grabber card''''
	* Linux Red Hat 7.2 vanilla installation
	* Hauppage Win TV 98 PCI
 
To install just do the following sequence as root :
	* /sbin/insmod videodev
	* /sbin/insmod i2c-core
	* /sbin/insmod i2c-dev
	* modprobe bttv
Now  you can start xawtv.

I found a simple java layer for Video4Linux. 
So now I have to create a simple program to detect movement between images.
I made a couple of spikes and now i can tell that it's nearly working. I've used JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) to manipulate images.
I need to find a better algorithm / tools to detect movement between frames. Actually my wireless cam seems to send frames with too much noise in my opinion.
I need to find a way to substract this noise.

''I did something like this (substract noise from wireless cam) last year, and now I've got to do it again, contact me if you're still interested. I'm in Montreal too. -- RobinMillette''
