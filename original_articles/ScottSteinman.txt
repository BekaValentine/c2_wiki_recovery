Dr. Scott Steinman

Professor, Southern College of Optometry

I teach courses in visual perception and program as part of my teaching and research, as well as just for fun. I program in Cocoa (with Objective-C), Java, REALbasic and Prograph. I am involved in the efforts to open source Prograph CPX.
