Sometimes we can't decide what to do next: there are just too many choices. We get confused and paralysed. 

According to JamesaDavis successful sportsmen restrict their choices. They get the smoothest responses and best decisions when they have three choices or fewer to pick from at any given moment. A decision must always be limited to three choices. This doesn't mean the problem has to be simple. Choices can be subdivided: once one of the choices happens, the next response breaks into three choices.
