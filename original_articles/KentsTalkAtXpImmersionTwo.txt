Kent showed up dressed in overalls and a baseball cap on backwards, presumably representing the everyman worker for his talk Wednesday night, which was mostly about FredrickWinslowTaylor, and how everything stupid in software development can be traced back to his methods.

"In the past, man was first. In the future, the system must be first." was the opening quote from Taylor.

With his last slide Kent suggested that the predominant software development paradigm has been a Taylorist approach to BuildThings. He contrasted this with a post-modernist paradigm for XP as a Conversation. Sounds like we could express the SystemMetaphor for XP as ConversationMetaphor.

During Q&A, Kent said that humility is the key attribute of a good XP programmer.

Humility appears to be a recurring theme on Wiki as well. http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=humility

''BenFranklin said that HumilityIsKey to business success. It would make sense that it applies to programming as well.''
