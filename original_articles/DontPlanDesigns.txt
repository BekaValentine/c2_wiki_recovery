[DON'T PLAN DESIGNS]

[To the tune of "Don't Sniff Coke" by Pato Banton]

 <spoken>
 Now this one is dedicated to the phasists all over.
 Remember the words of your crucial infotainer.
 When I say: I do not document I only test, code, and refactor.
 </spoken>

 When on the town or with my team I am de newbie and de mentor.
 Me notebook overflows with all de Unitary Testors.
 If testing business was de school then I will be de principle.
 If a bike I be de rider; if a SegWay gyroscopical.
 But if testing was religion then I would be sayin' bye bye.
 So I push on de Test Button den I push all'ya say Go Try.
 But fun and joke aside I increment de serious matter,
 And dedicate this style to each and every phasist writer.
 
 ||: I do not document I only test, code, and refactor :|| x4 

 ||: In Febr'ary of 95 then Phlip became de papa
     because our evolution did produce us a new version :|| x4

 Me offspring learned to talk and then I pair with her on homework.
 Hijita look up and she said:

 "Dad me glad that you refactor.
  For swapping code within constraints drop to de rest state proper.
  Now I can read de words you write so don't describe what's in the future."

 To languages dynamic I now turnin' my attention.
 I mock all of their layers but don't take no mock objections.
 I solve them for de simple case den solve all de projections.
 I do not guess de business space but bless dem with solutions.
 I also got a lot to read in alla my fine testing fixtures.
 Dat's why I do not document I only comment on de mixtures.

 ||: I do not document I only test, code, and refactor :|| x3
     I do not plan designs I only test, code, and refactor!

 One day I had to catch a plane from County Orange to Dallas.
 Sat down upon my seat and found me next to de White Collar.
 With perfect hair and suit he looked just like de robber baron.
 He sat down next to me in his right hand he had a Barrons.
 But I don't judge appearance I just pair and check de grammar.
 So introduced myself to him as Mr. Phlip Programmer.

 <spoken>
 [He say,] "Nice to meet you, I'm an architect, 
 And I direct big teams of coders.
 I've heard your name online before, but I just can't remember.
 But anyway I'm very very very glad to meet ya.
 And I've got a plan it's wrote by hand
 Now can you code it for ten grand?"
 </spoken>

 I looked upon the tray and saw hardcopy with de diagrams.
 Inside de diagrams I saw de boxes and de arrows.
 Me asked: What it do for you? It give you strength and power?
 Now everyone I want you to hear the way White Collar answered:

 "I give it to my teams and then they type in my designs.
 Coding night and day 'til they go out of their minds.
 Mushroom treat executives; the schedule's refined.
 No matter what they do my ass is not on the line!
 If you can read the UML I'l hire you this time.
 You'l find typing my design will not require your mind!"

 But I took the paper threw it right inside the snack cart trash slot.
 Said tell me the requirements in de order that you got.
 Open up my notebook and I wrote de test dat passed not.
 Wrote de code dat passed and den I checked out that it smelled not.
 Present it and White Collar see how fast I done dat feature.
 "But my next feature's gonna change things then you got no architecture."
 "Change is my design," I say, "one more change is in its nature.
 Each change just makes me faster if each time I will refactor."

 [He say,] "You won't know what you will get 
          until you'r done all of the effort."
 I say, "So pair and you take care with all de comments proper."
 But fun and joke aside I increment de serious matter,
 If new pairs find a better way to upgrade it they'r required.
 You document all day you'l hit de moving target never.
 After going with de flow we know you'l find no system's better,
 Why we do not document we only test code and refactor!

 <shouted>Refactor all de taxes, Bush!</shouted>
