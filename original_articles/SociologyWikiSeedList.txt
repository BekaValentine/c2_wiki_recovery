My, don't we have our work cut out for us? This is a list of pages that have been selected as seed material for TheReformSociety. No doubt there are many more, and also no doubt some of the material on these pages won't fit TheReformSociety's charter (mainly the SearchForTruth stuff ...) and some people will want some of these pages to stay on C2, or go elsewhere, come to think of it, and in general moving stuff from one wiki to another has always proven an acrimonious and thankless task.

So in the effort of moving and refactoring these pages, I'm just going to start with the "A"s and work my way down. Any kind soul who joins in this work will have the undying gratitude and respect of little old me, at least. -- PeterMerel

'''... and some of the pages they link to.'''

----

Here is the TwinPages listing from the MetaWikiSearchEngine for the above list. You can likely delete ''every'' page listed below without too much concern. 

''Unless of course, they contain material not encompassed by the page title. Thinking that pages are similar just because they share a title is extremely narrow-minded.''

Why would they contain material not encompassed by the page title? If so, we should delete the pages completely.

''Whatever and says you.  For a convenient example, compare the pages FightClub and http://www.wikipedia.com/wiki/Fight+Club; the former is a discussion which is entirely fair but that the latter would not want to have.''

You have been on Wiki for over a year, yet it's amazes me that you haven't learnt anything from all these intelligent people surrounding you. Nothing can be automated. Everything must be done by hands, hearts, and minds by everyone ''together''. You fail to apply anything but your skull, all alone like a bull moose. I have nothing to defend.

''A tragic irony that this page, which started out as trying to decide which pages to rescue from the wiki cleansers, is now being used as a quick and easy execution list.  Why the hurry in trying to find things to delete?''

I'm using all the indices available, more than you probably even know exist. I'm actually not using this page at all. There is a lot that I have done that I must now fix. FixYourWiki. -- SunirShah

Philosophy-related pages that may or may not be OnTopic initially:

	* DysonSphere
	* KantsCategoricalImperative

----

There is an ongoing SociologyWikiSeedListDiscussion about which pages deserve inclusion in this list.

What do you think about the WikicraticRules statement ? Is it the foundation of society and hence sociology ? -pj


----
Instead of a list, wouldn't it be easier to just add the tag, SociologyWiki to the pages we think would be good seed?
----
Given the current unexistence of a SociologyWiki ''per se'', consider TheAdjunct as an alternative destination.
