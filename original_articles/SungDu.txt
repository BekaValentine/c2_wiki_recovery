I have been worked as a linux application developer. And now I am working on Daum Communications (http://www.daum.net) as QualityAssurance Engineer of search engine service. I used to read books and watch movies for my free time. Recently, I'm very curious about ExtremeProgramming, ReFactoring, DesignPatterns..
