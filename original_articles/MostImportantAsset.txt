Employees

Boy do I get ''ticked'' when I hear this. Consider all the assumptions implicit in the statement:

* an employee's value decreases over time
* every 5 years, they will have to be replaced with newer, better models
* the old ones can be given to charity for a tax write-off

To paraphrase PatrickMcGoohan ''I am not an asset, I am a free man!''

Hey, it could be worse. Here, they call us ''intangibles''. We were so amused, we named the company band "The Intangibles"!

How about having a department of ''Human Capital''?

From the 3 March 1993 DilBert:

	 :	PointyHairedBoss: I've been saying for years that "Employees are our most valuable asset." It turns out that I was wrong. Money is our most valuable asset. Employees are ninth.
	 :	Wally: I'm afraid to ask what came in eighth.
	 :	PointyHairedBoss: Carbon paper.

It also implies that employees are property of the company. Ditto ''resources''. Of course, any better term that gets used will get turned into CorporateSpeak and corrupted. --PeteHardie
