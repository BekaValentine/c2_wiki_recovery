Microsoft's ComPlus lacks entity beans which help manage more complex applications.  How then do you program a complex application in ComPlus without it becoming a lot of low level relational database/SQL coding?

I don't think it is possible to avoid SQL coding in a moderate to large database if you want any level of performance.  I've seen an order of magnitude improvement in many cases by changing a SQL call (seconds to tenths of seconds).  There may be other reasons to have "entity beans," but I would not give up the ability to view and debug the underlying SQL calls.  --WayneMack
