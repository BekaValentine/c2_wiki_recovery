A new CompoundWord having one or three meanings:
* That which is following a plan or scheme which is projected as being accomplished by sequential and/or parallel processes.
* That which is accomplished in a way intended, (Software: IntentionalProgramming) '''not the result of accidental, incidental, or trials'''. 
* ....
