'''Da steh' ich nun, ich armer Tor, Und bin so klug als wie zuvor!''' 

I am a Diplom-Informatiker (aka Computer Scientist) in Germany, now teaching maths and ComputerScience and I'll do some consulting and programming.

Things of interest: 

* Efficient Programming: Getting better, what are the basics of programming and how can we improve it? 
* Whisky: Single Malt of Scotland and Whiskey of other countries
* My family: Simply private. 
* Anonymity in the net: What happens if you have multiple real identies? 
* Thinking: Think it in another way. 
* Old Table: Old men sitting around and discussing important things. But this also a private thing. 
* Ants: What's that big "think" behind 1,000,000 stupid ants building great things. Isn't it the same as human beings build cities? 
* Categorizing pictures: I have more then 100,000 images and haven't found any software that helps to sort and categorize the images for many(!) different categories and subcategories like humans (colleagues, friends (old friends) relatives (parents, aunts and uncles), family(children, wife))
** <shameless plug> Try Portfolio at http://www.extensis.com/ and its Categories feature. (However, Keywords may be faster and good enough for your uses.) </shameless plug> -- IanOsgood
* Lots of other things: Wilhelma in the city of Stuttgart, animals especially insects (see ants), plants, beauty of the nature, clouds, humans, beer, ... 


'''Anonymity:''' 

Normally, you have a base identity and in real life you have many identies: Being a father, a husband (or wife), colleague, boss, friend, uncle. Mostly identies (say roles) are overlapping (father and husband). You can view these roles/identies as object orientation. But not in the net! Why? 

'''Programming:''' 

Just doing things better. 
Major interests are 
* Improving code via automation
* CopyAndPasteProgramming, DuplicatedCode
* Refactoring
* optimizing the software process (SoftwareEngineering and SoftwareProcess)
* ConfigurationManagement
* VersionControl
* patterns
* ObjectOrientedProgramming
* AspectOrientedProgramming
* SuccessfulMeeting
* DefectTracking
* TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign 

Finishing many years of software development and managing I recently started as teacher for computer science and mathematics. Now looking forward to have more time (and less money) to live my life.

'''Whisky:'''

Whisky smells good and tastes good. I like it. Not too much, but one or two glasses a week are perfectly sufficient. I prefer Single Malts from Scotland, but didn't stop to test other countries like Japon, US, Canada, France and of course Ireland.
Near by lives an old Swabian farmer who distils his own whisky - not that bad. 
My favorites change with the seasons:
* spring: Balvenie, Isle of Jura
* summer: no whisky (but rum)
* autumn: Talisker, Glen Dronach
* winter: Laphroiag, Ardbeg, Talisker

'''Ants:''' 

Fascinating little animals. I think one little ant is very stupid, but why do they build "cities"? 

No ant can think about the whole complexity of its ant-hill. But the ant knows where to go, where to sleep and so on. I know as much about my city as an ant knows about its ant-hill. I know where to sleep, park, work, buy and I help the city do its job for all men. 

What is the main difference? Yes, we can think that means doing more complex things. Yes and we build more complex ant-hills, eh, sorry cities. 

'''Old Table: '''

I am a member of Old Table 138, Germany. And in 2003/2004 I was also the president ot Round Table 138. 

'''My family: '''

My family is strictly private. 

'''Thinking: '''

Sometimes very hard. But I love this.
