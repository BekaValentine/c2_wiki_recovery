"Wow! That ExtremeProgramming stuff is neat! We almost do it, too!" I hear this cry remarkably often. I have developed the following little joke description of one of my projects to warn people about what they are saying...

"Extreme Programming (a la ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation project) requires 4 things:
	* You do pair programming.
	* You deliver an increment every three weeks.
	* You have a user on the team full time.
	* You have regression UnitTest''''''s that pass 100% of the time.
As a reward for doing those, 
	* You don't put comments in the code.
	* You don't write any requirements or design documentation.

Now on this project, we're pretty close...
	* well, actually a couple of our guys sit in the basement, a couple on the 5th floor, and a couple 2 hours drive from here, so we don't do pair programming,
	* and actually, we deliver our increments every 4-6 months, 
	* we don't have users anywhere in sight,
	* and we don't have any UnitTest''''''s, 
'''but at least''' ''we don't have any design documentation, and we don't comment our code much!'' So in a sense, you're right, we're ''almost'' doing ExtremeProgramming!"

Heh. Where was I reading this the other day? Maybe ''ConsciousnessExplained'', by DanielDennett? Or was it in KentsBook? Anyway, the idea was that ''almost'' means the same thing as ''not''. That when a vendor claims his tool is ''almost'' anything, you should interpret it as the exact opposite.

The author goes on to explain that he would rather be ''almost dead'' than ''almost alive'', that any businessman in the world would rather be ''almost bankrupt'' rather than ''almost solvent''. <g> -- BillBarnett

''As in software that is AlmostCorrect...''

''You can find a similar concept in GeraldWeinberg 's work: LullabyLanguage. -- AlexChaffee''

From AlmostConsideredHarmful:  "'Almost' is a technical term meaning 'not'."
