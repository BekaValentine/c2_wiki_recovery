I've noticed that most pages seem to be focussed on a single concept of some kind.  Is this actually the case?

Why are there so many implementations of wiki and so many different formatting rules ?
Is there a standard set of formatting rules ?

*Since Wiki, in it's essence, got a lot to do with freedom to create, not only the work on any given wiki is rather informal, also the development of WikiEngine''''''s is also very 'free' in several meanings of the word. So any standard can exist only within the scope of a given WikiEngine. See http://wikiindex.org/WikiEngineTree for an overview. -MH
 
Most wiki powered sites usualy have somewhat formating rules but not all of them. Take for example The (wiki concept project). On there wiki you can create a listing or article with any formating you like. If the formating you put on does not work it become text and will not show. You can see this for yourself --ChrisMcClenaghan

*What is the 'wiki concept project'? -MH

I am relating this to an educational discussion about ThresholdConcept, which is the idea that there are certain key things that have to be grasped in the course of learning about something. The literature contains a lot of papers by people enthusiastic about this and others who are sceptical because it turns out to be difficult to pin down what the ThresholdConcept''''''s are in any particular case. I think that could be an issue with the WikiConcept. It may be different for different people and actually evolve with time or with particular uses. -- JohnFletcher
