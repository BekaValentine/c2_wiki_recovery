Sometimes I see something that i would like followed up. Like this one in FirstLanguageLearned - 

"Lisp I find amazingly simple though. (For the record I'm 12 now) - April 7 2005 "tombom" " 

- in this particular case i would be interested to see what languages appeal to the now 17 year old.


So I thought it may be a good idea to mark the page with a reference to DidYouPostThis, and also a note in DidYouPostThus attempting to explain what it is you would like the author(s) to do.
