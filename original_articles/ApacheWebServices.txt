Apache Synapse is an OpenSource WebServices incubator project ("Web services mediation framework") from a spin-off company called WSO2. It is built on donation from Sonic Software (a well-known vendor in EnterpriseServiceBus). [Not sure on this at all but] I think it purports to support WebServicesExtensions (WS-* kind) for InformationSecurity.

In SeptemberZeroFive, it is getting quite a bit of press coverage; it is said to be significant from both WebServices and OpenSource perspectives.

''One statement was made and said "...an alternative to closed-source ESBs to "keep vendors honest."".''

'''JavaAndDotNet implications'''

This appear to have relevance to WebServicesInteroperability between multiple ESBs, but will it have significance in interoperability between JavaAndDotNet? If so, should companies that are entrenched in the MicrosoftWay disregard the technical implications of these ServiceOrientedArchitecture initiatives?
