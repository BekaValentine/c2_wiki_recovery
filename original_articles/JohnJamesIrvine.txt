I have an interest in programming languages, particularly LispLanguage and related languages (SchemeLanguage, DylanLanguage).  I also find EiffelLanguage, ForthLanguage, BetaLanguage and ObjectiveCaml interesting.  I have used FsharpLanguage, CsharpLanguage, CeePlusPlus & PythonLanguage in industry.

Currently working for TeslaForecast.
