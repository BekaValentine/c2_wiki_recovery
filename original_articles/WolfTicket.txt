A vendor advertises compliance with some standard, but does not deliver on it. This produces VendorLockIn, because developers cannot build on the standard advertised and must settle for the vendor's alteration. That is the main idea behind the antipattern as presented above.

It's difficult to find the word used in that particular sense outside that page. That definition (counterfeit ticket to a concert or sporting event) exists on a disambiguation page on Wikipedia, but not as a page itself.

There are at least three other major definitions on the web:
*Street slang approximately meaning "talking trash"
*Russian term for a Soviet document, possibly a restricting version of a passport or diploma
*A term relating to Polish resistance during WorldWarTwo

The Russian meaning is actually quite close to the antipattern term as described. According to Wikipedia, a "wolf ticket" was a restrictive document given out in place of a more useful PassPort. The antipattern link above refers to software that only fits some standard in a limited or unuseful way, rather than (more usefully) holding rigorously to the standard. The term WolfTicket might be expected to indicate a document with some predatory intent, so this could just be a lingual coincidence. --JesseMillikan


The Polish meaning is about PROHIBITING someone from something, in Communist Poland it was used to repress free-thinkers, by preventing them from studies (almost all higher universities then were governmental). Or used to make people immigrate (wolf ticket was a name used for one way passport, allowing only to leave Poland, but not to come back). --TomaszBorek
