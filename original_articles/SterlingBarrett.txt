I worked with JoshuaKerievsky on UsingPatterns. I'm also a long time member of the New York DesignPatternsStudyGroup  (NewYorkStudyGroup).

I enjoyed UsingPatterns very much.  I feel it was very successful.

I'm the conference chair for UsingPatterns98.  Some feedback:
* I think UP98 will be larger than UP97.  That is, patterns will reach a milestone of interest over the next twelve months so that there will be many more people who will want to attend.
* UP98 days could end a little earlier so attendees don't die of exhaustion.
