KeithBraithwaite and RichardDrake had an encouraging experience of pair refactoring WikiStroke, using email. 

It's not realistic or necessary to obtain agreement from everyone that has contributed to the PagesToRefactor.  As in XP, a WikiPairing should be confident in their authority, go ahead and get the job done: '''ImproveSignalAndReadability'''.  Analagous to XP's continual, informal cross team communication, there is sometimes value in leaving RefactoringNotes around for others to comment on.
