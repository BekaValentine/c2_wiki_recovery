WikidWiki is an alias for Wikid.

At Wikid you can create your own wiki as an instance of a centrally hosted script. No need to own your own server, no technical knowledge required. Basic setup is free (30 pages, 1MB Web space for uploads).

Wikid is continuously updated. Improvements are immediately available for all members. Current version is 0.2.0 (as of April 28th 2004).

Wikid is written in PHP4/MySQL.

[Question: http://www.wikid.de has 'disappeared' (i.e., changed into a very marginal html page). If anyone knows where it has gone to, please remove this line and enter the right link above. Thanks.

Not only that, the http://www.wikid.de seems to be defaced.

Answer (kind of): The German text says that Wikid is no longer being developed. New sites could be installed with the existing system (the wiki?) on request, existing but not accessible sites would be reactivated on request (whatever that means). Questions should go to support@wikid.de.]

For now, Wikid is available in German only.
