Time consuming and depressing.

''Yeah, when I've been doing it I've always resented that it's hard work I don't get paid for...''

You noticed that too, eh? Perhaps we should start a list of which of us are currently JobSearching -- I'll start:

Tips on searching...

	* Read WhatColorIsYourParachute because it may drastically change your view of 'How do I succeed at JobSearching?'
	* What you find on websites is almost certainly out of date. ''Perhaps this one too!''
	* On the web, look for stockbrokers who have a tech portfolio - one place where you may get a brief list of names of quoted companies with one page summaries of what they do.
	* Or just http://google.com it -- if you can think of really good keywords, like expertise, technologies, application area -- google usually nails these pages.

''Should we merge this list with XpPositionWanted?''

I'd say "no", as not all of us are looking for an XP position.

----

Move to India. That is where all the tech jobs are going. Just don't drink the water.
