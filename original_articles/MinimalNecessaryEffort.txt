This can be a Pattern or a AntiPattern 

While doing something, you can adopt an strategy of minimal necessary effort (MNE).  

I actually believe that this can be understood as a XP Pattern gone wild.

The problems are: if you area learning something, MNE can make you pass exams, but not really learn it.
