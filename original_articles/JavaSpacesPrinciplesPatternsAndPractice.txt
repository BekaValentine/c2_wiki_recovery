''From the Amazon.com blurb:''

"After a foreword by distributed computing pioneer DavidGelernter, the book provides a short technology overview describing the makeup of JavaSpaces. The authors atomize their description of JavaSpaces as an overseer application that lets programs running on separate computers store and share persistent data. While the JavaSpaces API is by itself remarkably simple, this book demonstrates with deliberate fanfare the resolution of common distributed computing problems using complex design patterns."
