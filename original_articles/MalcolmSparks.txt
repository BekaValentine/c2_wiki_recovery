I'm a Java programmer based in Market Harborough, UK.

In May 1998, I founded EJBHome, the first website to provide a free EJB implementation for developers. This was acquired by IONA Technologies in November 1998, forcing a relocation from London, England. (IONA sometimes paid KentBeck to fly over to help install XP, so I've got to meet Kent a few times
for beers.)

In 1997, I also founded a Java Users' Group in Manchester, England. (After a couple of meetings this was disbanded because I moved to London.)

Most likely to be contacted at malcolm@congreve.com.

If you see me at conferences I am most likely to be talking about software modularization, programming techniques and style.
