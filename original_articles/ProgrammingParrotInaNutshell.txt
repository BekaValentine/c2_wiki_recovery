Programming Parrot is the definitive reference for the new, dynamic programming language, Parrot, a language intended to merge the strengths of Perl and Python. 

Stemming from the meeting of minds in the new ActiveState Technical Advisory Board, Programming Parrot was written jointly by Larry Wall, the original creator of Perl, and Guido van Rossum, the inventor of Python. 

It unites the flexibility of Perl with the simplicity and maintainability of Python.
