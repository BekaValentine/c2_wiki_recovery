A big part of EvolutionaryDelivery

One thing that stuck in my mind from all those years ago at University, was a statement from a tutor exclaiming "always start from something that works".

What I understood was that there is never a need to start from scratch. You can always start coding from some other known piece of code, and modify the code using "very small steps", thereby greatly reducing the uncertainty when some bug may become apparent in testing.

The downside of "very small steps" is that progress can be painfully slow.

One way of giving the illusion of progress is PrintfDesign. You can sketch out the modifications to your known starting point, sending signals to the screen that let you know what you intend the code to be doing once the skeleton has been fleshed out.

At least your intention is demonstrable.
