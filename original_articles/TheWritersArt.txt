''The Writer's Art'' is a book and a syndicated newspaper column by James J. Kilpatrick. ISBN: 0836279190

Mr Kilpatrick approaches grammatical problems with great humor and a heavy dose of seriousness. Or ''vice versa''. While I haven't read the book, I have habitually read his column for years. He addresses such conundrums as EatsShootsAndLeaves regularly. He responds to readers PetPeeve''''''s, in addition to many of his own. He doesn't come across as too AnalRetentive or anything... just strives to promote actual literacy and the lost arts of careful proofreading, good grammar, and thoughtful editing. -- RonJandrasi
