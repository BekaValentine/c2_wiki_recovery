I'm a fearless wiki user and abuser. I run agendawiki.com which uses a subtly tweaked UseMod wiki engine in perl. Extensions for style, tables and uploaded images are the most interesting features.

I love the idea of wiki editing, but hate the diversity of the markup languages.

Code for the love of it.
