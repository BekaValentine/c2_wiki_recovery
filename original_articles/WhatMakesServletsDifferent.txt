Java servlets are different from other web technologies in two ways: 

	1. They are persistent, and can maintain complex state efficiently between connections 
	2. They are ObjectOriented?, being Java, and therefore encourage an OO approach to development. 

''Both Apache with mod_perl and ASP with PerlScript? satisfy (1), and Perl can certainly be written using OO approaches.''

Similarly the MicrosoftWay (ASPs & COM components) satisfies (1) and (2). 

''Sorry, MS aren't very good at (2) at all. See DnaVsOo.''

Sorry, the above topic doesn't prove your point at all. Dna certainly encourages an OO approach to development.
