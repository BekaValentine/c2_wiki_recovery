The pattern was created to convey nutritional information about food products in a way that allows the public to understand the information at a glance in the context of a daily diet. The Daily Value declares the percent of each nutrient that a serving of the food provides. For example, the Daily Value for fat, based on a 2,000-calorie diet, is 65 grams (g). A food that has 13 g of fat per serving would state on the label that the "percent Daily Value" for fat is 20 percent.

It also provides a basis for thresholds that define descriptive words for nutrient content, called descriptors, such as "high fiber" and "low fat." For example, the descriptor "high fiber" can be used if a serving of food provides 20 percent or more of the Daily Value for fiber, that is, 5 g or more. 

What the Daily Value is not intended to do is tell people what amounts of nutrients they should eat every day. Daily Values are not recommended intakes. Daily Values are a pattern for exposing nutritional information to people so they can better assess what their overall daily diet needs are.
