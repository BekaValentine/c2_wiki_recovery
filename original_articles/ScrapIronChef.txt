You need certain equipment to cook dinner.  Your choices are (1) find it in the junkyard (2) bodge something (3) steal it (4) go hungry.

From a memorable episode of Good Eats that merged the IronChef and JunkyardWars motifs.

If you work somewhere that can only buy software and equipment once a fiscal year, then you HaveThisPattern.
