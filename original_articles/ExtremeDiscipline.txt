I've moved the old ExtremeDiscipline to IsXpSynergistic, on the grounds that it's talking about the synergy of the various components of PureXp.

For me, ExtremeDiscipline refers to the third of three categories of ExtremeRules, which is:

''Developers must''
	* ''Run AcceptanceTest''''''s often.''
	* ''RefactorMercilessly.''
	* ''IntegrateOften.''
	* ''ReleaseOften.''

''Development must pause if these rules cannot be complied with.''
