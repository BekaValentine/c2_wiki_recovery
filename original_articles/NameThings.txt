Naming Things -- ThinkingOutLoud DonaldNoyes.20080503.2320.m05

It is amongst the things that humankind shall do, that things be named.
* naming things, some found to be useful and other things which have not yet proved to be so. The first, being useful, is valuable, the second may only be usable, and have to wait to become useful (if ever).
* It is in naming things that we begin our ability to handle things (mentally, physically and virtually). How far would we get if we resorted only to such instructions as "Hey, you, hand me that thing over there."

I believe that valued things are defined things, and that one learns by "hard work". The two of these together will eventually lead one to BecomingCompetent.
