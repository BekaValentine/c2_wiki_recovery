FreeCard is an opensource clone of Apple's HyperCard program. It aims to provide a very simple program which allows users with no technical knowledge to control their computer and create useful applications. FreeScript, the language used in FreeCard, is largely based on natural language and is intended to be 100% compatible with HyperTalk.
