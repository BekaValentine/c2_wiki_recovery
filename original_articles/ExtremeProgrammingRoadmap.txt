Welcome to the WikiWiki entry point for ExtremeProgramming (XP).

	'''Note''':	This page assumes you have some familiarity with ExtremeProgramming and also WikiWiki. If you are brand new to XP and want to start with the basics, see the XpFaq. If you are brand new to WikiWiki and want to learn more, try Wiki's NewUserPages.

This site has captured several years of Extreme Programming discussion and evolution. Use this roadmap to find your way to the most important pages in a logical order. You can always download a snapshot of these pages: http://xp.c2.com/html.zip

Begin with some of the contextual overview pages: 
	* WhosWritingAboutXp
	* ExtremeBenefits
	* ExtremeProgrammingInContext 
	* ExtremeProgrammingSystem
	* ExtremeProcess
	* ExtremeRoles
	* ExtremeProgrammingSummary
	* ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices
	* ExtremeProgrammingArticles

The glossary entry, or a ShortDefinitionOfXp.

And this could be a candidate for the ExtremeProgrammingAnthem.

Before you get to the programming, you should do some ExtremePlanning. But don't get carried away with the concept. It isn't the right solution for everything. Also, KentBeck has sort of a checklist to help you know, AreYouDoingXp?

The DrivingMetaphor and OneHandOnTheYoke set out the paradigm.

Specific ExtremeProgramming practices:
	* DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork encourages us not to over (or under)-engineer;
	* AskTheCode because it knows; CodeSmell''''''s if it has a problem; ListenToTheCode;
	* UnitTest''''''s ensure that we don't break one another's code;
	* AcceptanceTest''''''s tell us how we're progressing against user needs;
	* An OnsiteCustomer to make sure we build business value;
	* ContinuousIntegration helps avoid IntegrationHell;
	* ContinuousIntegrationRelentlessTesting ditto;
	* RefactorMercilessly keeps the code clean and speeds progress;
	* and see also WikiPagesAboutRefactoring;
	* PairProgramming gives higher quality, great cross-training, and higher speed; (mailing list: PairProgramming);
	* SpikeSolution helps explore the area we're working on;
	* ModelFirst plus SpartanUserInterface helps us concentrate on real customer value
	* ExtremePlanning suggests quickly building a map of the whole imagined system and incrementally refining it
	* The PlanningGame formalizes the rituals and roles of planning
	* CountDownToRelease discusses how to use the ExtremePlanning practices when you're getting close to release
	* ExtremeReuse - adopting third party software and making it XP-compatible by building tests
	* TossIt - making projects trim and keeping projects trim
	* SystemMetaphor - how we communicate the system to ourselves and others
	* XpDesign - who does the design in an XP project, and when?
	* XpSimplicityRules
	* OnceAndOnlyOnce
	* ExtremeDocuments - we do documentation, sometimes differently
	* SupportCrisis - what to do until the doctor comes
	* IncrementalDelivery
	* LazyOptimization and EarlyProfiling
	* OpenWorkspace
	* UserStory - like use cases, but different
	* EngineeringTask - a UserStory gets broken down into these

Results in...
	* IterativeDevelopment - tends to be a natural result of ContinuousIntegration and ContinuousIntegrationRelentlessTesting and DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork at each iteration
	* DynamicDesign - from RefactorMercilessly and short Code-Compile-Debug cycle
	* FewerWorkHours [important]
