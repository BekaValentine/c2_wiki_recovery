Note that the "Core Contributor Foundation" was written as an example of a commonly accepted pattern form, '''not''' as an actual pattern.  The original author does not believe it is a pattern.
----
Online communities often experience similar problems within similar contexts.  Often the solutions to these problems are alike.  Here is a simple example of a proposed pattern:

'''Name:''' Core contributor foundation

'''Context:'''  A new community focusing on a specific topic.  Most members are interested in the topic, but are not greatly committed to the new community.

'''Problem:'''  Not enough material to hold people's interest.  Several members plan to leave the community soon.

'''Forces:'''
	* If contributions are infrequent, readers may stop looking for new material.
	* With fewer readers, contributors may not feel the community is worth the effort of creating material
	* There is a core group of people dedicated to the new community.

'''Solution:'''  Core members of the community share the effort of contributing a consistent flow of material.  When some core members are unable to contribute, others contribute more to maintain the flow.

'''Resulting Context:'''  A consistent flow of material is maintained, attracting a larger group of readers.  Non-core contributors have examples of good material which they can emulate and build upon.  Core contributors may feel that they are overworked.

'''Examples:'''
	* WikiWikiWeb, 1995-1996.  Several authors were directly invited to help build the community.
	* OrgPatterns wiki.  ''(Insert text why this fits the pattern.)''
	* SlashDot.  Has an "editorial team" who often contribute news items. Most are contributed by slashdot readers, rather than its administrators.
	* CoreIdeology. An strong organization is kept strong with a core ideology. (Is this an example? It is more a relation to another topic)
