I'm a Project Team Leader with the Belgian Armed Forces. We have been developing and extending a C/S application using Powerbuilder (v4.0 - 7.0.3). I have done a lot of programming, but am moving more toward architecture and design.

I've played around with Distributed PB and WebPB, UML, Rose and am always looking for good design patterns.

I should complete this description soon.
