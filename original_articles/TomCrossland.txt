	 :	It cheers to me that the association of escepticos has sent to him to prove that my rat does not have psiquicos powers  
	 :	Demas simpson does not leave much by their experience like members the jury in the judgment of o.j..  
	 :	It cheers to me that it has come.
	 :	Fast.  This late I must discredit a new inventor.

This is what it means:

	 :	I'm glad that the Sceptics Association sent you to check that my rat doesn't have psychic powers
	 :	The others don't get out much after their experience as members of the jury in the O.J. Simpson trial
	 :	I'm glad you came
	 :	Quickly. This afternoon I have to discredit a new inventor.
