 The CHicago Agile Developers group (CHAD) provides a forum for
 Chicago area software developers to share their experience,
 best practices and ideas regarding the development of software
 in the face of rapid change.

 CHAD members will "congregate" monthly (or semi-monthly) to
 discuss ideas and experiences with Agile Software Development
 in general, the Agile Alliance, and particular methodologies
 like XP, Jim Highsmith's Adaptive Software Development,
 Alistair Cockburn's Crystal methodologies, SCRUM, FDD, (etc.).

 The "Kickoff" meeting will be this Wednesday April 25 at
 ObjectMentor in Vernon Hills. The meeting will begin at 7pm.
 People may begin gathering at 6:30pm. Directions may be found
 at the CHAD webpage at http://www.objectmentor.com/chad.htm

 Since we will try to serve refreshments (yes - you heard me
 right, that's FREE FOOD ;-) it would be good if those planning
 on attending could send an email reply to this message or to
 the CHAD mailing list to give us an idea of how many people
 to expect.

 The tentative agenda is:
 1. Welcome to CHAD
 2. Discussion of future meeting schedule and locations
 3. 60 min talk on Agile Alliance/Manifesto (Bob Martin)
 4. Solicitation of future topics/speakers.
