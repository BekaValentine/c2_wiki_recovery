A text wiki is one which the text presented in the html page by the browser is as close as possible to the text as it appears in the TextEdit.

Examples of how this wiki can be made to present text in a TextWiki format follow
----
Example 1  ( Wrapped Text )

This is an example of what a page will look like when the edited text is textonly, i.e. has no markups:

It is clear that Inter-Wiki technology has 
been delivered, and is continuing to be 
developed, and will expand in the future.
 
The future appears to be less Inter-Wiki
and more Inter-Net. What has been called 
wiki appears to be becoming the document 
arm of Public Internet Communication, 
meshing with threading friendly systems, 
blogs, identity services, resource sharing, 
and existing online communities. 
----
Example 2 ( retained format using <pre> text </pre> )

Using only one space in front of each line in the edited text results in a textual presentation in the html in which the text is caused to appear as it was in the TextEdit.

 It is clear that Inter-Wiki technology has 
 been delivered, and is continuing to be 
 developed, and will expand in the future.
