The fundamental challenge we should come to grips with is what we call "same as, except". 
Paul G. Bassett, Framing Software Reuse, Lessons from the real world, contains (some good Dilbert cartoons and) an excellent (70 pages) executives overview explaining "Reuse that works".  

Contains some interesting arguments to built a case for reuse in any environment (not only Bassett's Frames).
