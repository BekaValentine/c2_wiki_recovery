''Many Internet protocols and applications which use the Internet employ public key technology for security purposes and require a public key infrastructure to manage public keys.''

I'm not sure what this is. Judging by the web page, it appears:

* That in 1997, people met to talk about a PublicKeyInfrastructure
* They also used C2 mailing lists.
* They wanted an IETF sponsored PK certificate format, signature format. And they wanted a standard way to find keys.
* The result was to be called "SimplePublicKeyInfrastructure."
* They referenced RFC's 2692, 2693.

If such a thing exists, I've never seen it. At least not in Python, at any rate.

Anyone with any more information?

Here is a link to page about SPKI: http://theworld.com/~cme/html/spki.html

The page is pretty good in my opinion.
