This edit is being done with Inferno's browser '''Charon''' as released in version 3 -- an Inferno emulator now available as a binary download for a variety of operating systems -- see http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno

Version 4 is outdated (20040527). Source available under the GPL at: http://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/
The current source is found at https://code.google.com/p/inferno-os/source/checkout

They have also released a plug-in operating system for Microsoft's Internet Explorer, see http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/pi 

Is anyone else playing with this OperatingSystem?  It seems far more advanced and much simpler than Java -- How can that be?  Beats me, maybe they refactored better.

The acme-sac programming environment is built on inferno: http://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/
