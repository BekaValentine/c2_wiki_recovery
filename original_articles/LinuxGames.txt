There is quite a large number of games for GnuLinux, contrary to common belief.  In a shop for computer games in Denmark on the 20th of Marts 2004, it turned out the shop sold a game called UnrealTournament''''''2004 which apparently also worked under GnuLinux.

There are also games for GnuLinux that doesn't run on many other platforms, like Pingus and Armagetron.

Of late, there even exists a online forum on efnet IRC called #LinuxGames, which has focus on FreeAsInBeer games for GnuLinux.  The channel has a homepage 
http://linuxgames.no-ip.info/linux/

There is also a simular channel ( #GameTome ) on freenode (irc.gnu.org), they also have a homepage: http://www.happypenguin.org/
