Software engineer.  Former LiterateProgramming addict.  MyersBriggs ENTJ.
Mathematics PhD, with special interest in category theory,
recursive function theory, and theory of automata. Former RecentChangesJunkie.
Teetering on the edges of becoming a VeryOldPerson, or at least an OldTimer.

I recently (May, 2000) read ZenAndTheArtOfMotorcycleMaintenance,
which has changed my outlook on work and on life in general.

Currently employed by L''''''exisNexis, where I have been trying
to promote WikiInTheWorkplace.  I wrote my own Wiki variant
(based originally on Ward's code, but now about 7 times as large
and with almost none of the original code left) and have used it
to create several ProjectWiki and TeamWiki sites at work.
(In hindsight what I really should have set up was a WikiFarm,
but that wasn't clear until I had nearly a dozen independent instances
of Wiki.) Wiki has been enormously useful to ''me'' at work,
but my attempts to sell it to others have met with mixed success.

So far, my greatest contributions to the WikiWikiWeb are an idea
for a WikiWikiThemeSong, and a semi-doggerel PetrarchanSonnet
in PoemWiki.  I'll try to be more constructive and less OffTopic
in the future.

An anecdote about me:

When I was preparing for my oral exams (en route to a PhD),
I knew that I would be nervous when the Big Day came.
I wanted to lead off with an ice-breaker to quickly dissipate the
tension in the room.  So I had a T-shirt made up with the following
motto on it (which, as far as I know, is original with me):

	 :	Logic, logic everywhere, but not a thought to think.

(It helps to know that my major subject was mathematical logic.)
This had the desired effect: I walked into the room, the examiners
read the shirt, they cracked up, and a friendly atmosphere was
established.  (And I passed the exam.)
