Based on ItsTimeToDumpCeeSyntax, here is a concrete "redone" version of C-like syntax for exploration.

'''Modifiers Come After'''

 func foo(aa: int, bb, cc: char): public int {  
   xx, yy: double;   // both are double
   ...
 }

("func" or "function" are both valid.)

Question: would it be better to separate parameters with semi-colon for consistency?

'''Boolean Operators'''

The words "and", "or", and "not" are accepted ''in addition to'' "&&" etc. This is for familiarity and for non-English speakers.

'''Switch Statement - Set-based and No Break'''

 switch(a) {
   case 1,2,3 {...}
   case 4 {...}
   case 5,6 {...}
   otherwise {...}
 }
