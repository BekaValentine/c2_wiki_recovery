ExtensibleStylesheetLanguage (XSL) has these related components, XsltLanguage, XpathLanguage and XslFormattingObjects. See http://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/ for the 2001 rectified standard.

* The XsltLanguage spec predates that of the superset ExtensibleStylesheetLanguage by two years

* ExtensibleStylesheetLanguage is focussed on document-centric transformation, whereas XsltLanguage is data centric transformation.

* XpathLanguage is very well popular (second after ExtensibleMarkupLanguage) within the Xml''''''Community, as it is entwined with the XsltLanguage.

* XslFormattingObjects is a relatively new and obscure page description language. It may yet find its niche in fulfilling needs to create printed information on the fly.

There had been controversies surrounding the creation of XSL even within the XML community. The debate has been, and still is, that CascadingStyleSheets (CSS) would have sufficed for formatting Xml documents designated for web servers.
