PBAC, in the context of OMII InformationSecurity aspects, stands for ProcessBasedAccessControl. Other  Google matches are "Policy Based AC" and "Provision Based AC", and there is also a term of "Probe Based Admission Control" that is used in the vicinity of the above context.

Earlier I was looking to understand how PBAC links to PolicyBasedManagement, and how SecurityManagement intersects with SystemsManagement intersects with SoaSystemsManagement, MessageLevelSecurity etc.

An irrelevant link on "PBAC OMII" ('''Trivial''' Google search link, 1st match at http://www.omii.ac.uk/docs/2.0.0/omii_2_user_guide/services/omii_services_do_for_me.htm ) . Other MarkeTecture''''''s exist.
