More broadly, any kind of ApplicationDevelopment involving team(s), under the guidance of a ProjectManagement approach that is applicable to a WaterfallMethodology or AgileMethodology. Sometimes the work in done in a LowDisciplineMethodology fashion though (And ArtificialDeadline''''''s are to blame :)).
