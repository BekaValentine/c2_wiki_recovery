As you reach for a pfennig lodged between two cushions on a couch, the act of reaching for it will spread the cushions apart, allowing the pfennig to drop farther.  Given infinitely deep couch cushions and an infinitely long arm, you will never be able to reach the pfennig.

And who wouldn't want infinitely deep couch cushions?
