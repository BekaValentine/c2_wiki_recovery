The following script will find pages that have been cited on wiki but not yet defined. Although they appear to be wanted, they may be misspellings of existing pages or pages too trivial to merit definition. This list is updated as part of a batch update that runs daily. Citations from RecentChanges and its kin are assumed to be recent deletions and ignored.
	* http://c2.com/cgi/wantedWikiPages?n=6 -- most wanted
	* http://c2.com/cgi/wantedWikiPages?n=3 -- lots more

The best course of action for these pages isn't necessarily to create a page. Often, it is better to change the references so they are no longer WikiName''''''s. Where applicable, you can just change the case, add spaces or insert SixSingleQuotes ...
	* ToDo ==> TODO or To Do
	* GlayvenHaven ==> Glayven''''''Haven

'''Bugs:'''

Unfortunately this lists as non-existent pages that exist on sister sites. BigOmega, for example, occurs 10 or 15 times, but when you go to edit it there is a version on MeatBall. The Wanted''''''Pages feature would be much more useful if these pages could somehow be filtered out.

It also lists BiCapitalized words within URLs. All text within a URL should be ignored.

Today (Feb 24 2005) a WikiSpammer used WantedPages as a list of new pages to place spam on. This technique was effective for two reasons:

* The new spam pages, by virtue of being WantedPages, are not OrphanPage''''''s and thus (if allowed to persist) would better contribute to PageRank.
* One WikiGnome who went after the spammer and deleted these pages was temporarily banned by the SurgeProtector as a result. (the SurgeProtector triggers on page deletion; but not on page creation).
