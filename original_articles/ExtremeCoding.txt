Some of the ExtremeRules

Code may not be released unless it:
	* is formatted to agreed CodingStandard''''''s (Kent Beck's SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns is suggested.)
	* has been coded by PairProgramming. 
	* has UnitTest''''''s (when a bug is found a test is created to guard against it coming back.)
	* has passed all UnitTest''''''s at 100%.
	* has been checked against the latest base-line. A SingleReleasePoint is recommended.

Code may not be released if it
	* was HardToWrite
	* Adds Functionality Early (does not DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork)

Code which breaks these rules must be backed out and redone.
