From NonTuringComputing:
-----
On questionably even computing at all - what the heck does computable mean, anyway?
	* Love of a mother for an offspring
	* The unfolding of ordinary life

We are trying to say what we might but can't compute.  So I don't know if it can be ''said.'' If someone actually said it, the right answer, would you recognize it?  Would you recognize it as computation?  Or would you not accept it as computation for the exact reason that computation must look like Turing activity to you (we/us)? The love that a mother feels for her offspring - is that computation... is it nonTuring computation? Is the procreation of life as the unwinding of DNA activity computation at all... Turing or non or not computing?

I'd suggest looking up what the term "computer" meant before ENIAC. Or the computer scientists' particular blindspot? I wouldn't worry too much about that; philosophers and mathematicians deal with this topic too, and I suspect a number of very smart computer scientists (computational philosophers? cognitive scientists?).

This has been the biggest hurdle facing philosophy for all time: what makes us so damned special? The others are only RubeGoldberg machines.  -- SunirShah
