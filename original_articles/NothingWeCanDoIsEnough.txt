This is a definite AntiPattern of a sort that sets in as it becomes obvious that thoughtless management is congenitally incapable of rewarding or even acknowledging dedication and commitment.  After a while it becomes obvious that one is merely being exploited.  An expression of dissatisfaction will be generated until such expressions produce no additional increment of work and then the opinion will be expressed that WizardsAreLazy.  The remedy to this kind of manipulation and exploitation is a ruthless professionalism.  I like the fact that XP shows an awareness of this problem and deals with it in a responsible way.  But in the final analysis what is needed is mature managers. --RaySchneider
