Take a look at http://www.inet.tele.fi/team/panu/ ''(BrokenLink since March 17, 2001; maintained for searchability)''
for my home-page.  

WIKI is cool. I built a www-bulletin board remotely like it.
The main differences are:

	1. The text you enter may be plain text but if you start it with the <HTML> tag it will be interpreted as such. 

	2. You may use any userID which then is used to form a crypted suffix. If you re-enter the same message-title and userID, you can EDIT your previous message. If you use an empty userID others can guess it and you can collaborate.

	3. The messages are all in the same area, the most recent at the top, and they flow over the bottom of the page to ever larger bins.

Have fun
