This Web site is the original "WikiWiki", and is primarily for discussing software engineering, programming and related topics. OffTopic pages may not last very long.

For a very simple introduction , see BriefIntro -- or for other languages, InternationalOneMinuteWiki.

Navigation: mark with edit=page name(e.g: c2.com/cgi/wiki?edit=OneMinuteWiki to edit this page) and hit Enter (or do whatever you do to go to a URL). Note that the page name must be a WikiWord.

Either of these methods will bring up an editing page with the text "Describe page name here". Edit this as desired and save it.

Deletion Conventions:
* To delete a page, replace its text with the word "delete".
* If you create an experimental page, please delete it.
* Any other page exists until someone else seconds the deletion.
* Unseconded deletions can be undone by using the EditCopy.
* Seconded deletions can usually be undone by using the HistoryPages (http://c2.com/wiki/history)

Making Yourself Known: (we prefer you to use RealNamesPlease, rather than false online names)
* Set up a UserName for yourself that will show up in RecentChanges.
* Create your own WikiHomePage.
* Use a WikiSignature when appropriate or if you would like to.

Security:
* There is no security at all. Anyone could jump in and delete content. Some content might get restored, but don't fret about it; it's part of WhyWikiWorks. See WhyNobodyDeletesWiki.
* It's easy for someone to use somebody else's name. Please don't, and don't assume that signatures have any significance other than simple politeness.

Advice from Old-timers:
* Please read GoodStyle and WikiEditingCustoms before editing or adding pages. Also read various pages to get the feel of Wiki before you start editing. Remember, WikiIsNotWikipedia.
* Follow WikiSocialNorms if you want to be respected by other WikiZens.
* Play nice, okay?

Advice for new members:
* If you find a block of text in need of a clearer, simpler explanation -- and you have one -- supply it. (However, avoid changing signed content without permission. Signed content is text groupings with a name or initial after it.)
* Simply go on and do not give up.
