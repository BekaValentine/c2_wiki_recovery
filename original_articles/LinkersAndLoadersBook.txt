''Linkers and Loaders'' by JohnLevine (ISBN:1558604960).  A thorough treatments of the subject of binary linkers and loaders (see LinkerProgram for definition).  Short, but sweet.  

One issue with this book is that the material focuses on linkers for native machine ObjectCode  It covers these in great depth, including modern techniques like shared libraries and some issues with linking languages like C++ and Java.  However, it gives little attention to issues like DynamicCompilation, VirtualMachine''''''s, IntermediateLanguage''''''s/ByteCode, and the like--perhaps this is an unfair complaint as this material may be considered out of scope by the author.  If you are looking for material on how the JavaVirtualMachine or CommonLanguageRuntime work, this probably isn't the book for you (though you may find it useful).

If, OTOH, you're looking for information on how ld.so works, this is ''the'' book to read.  I'm aware of no other text out there that covers this topic in as much breadth and depth.
