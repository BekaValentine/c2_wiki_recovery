I'm a software developer particularly interested in SocialSoftware such as BlogSpace or WikiWikiWeb.

I adore my day job which is contributing to the system that powers http://zed.cbc.ca , but I also do the occasional consulting gig through http://oobik.com. Currently I'm researching WikiDesignPrinciples for ideas on how to graft wiki functionality onto the existing zed.cbc.ca backend - marrying the cultures of 'corporate bureaucracy' and innate wiki openness. 

I've also championed the use of a wiki ( SnipSnap ) for our department at work..

Update - I've since moved onto consulting exclusively, though wikis still figure prominently in my work. I'm hosting a wiki dedicated to the sport of Ultimate at http://ultipedia.org . Currently, ultipedia does not have a critical mass, and I am investigating various methods to promote it while adding pertinent content.
