I guess this is an AmericanCulturalAssumption thing. But what does it mean? 

FourthOfJuly:  July Fourth is the day the United States declared its independence.

July 4 happens to be my birthday, which means that restaurants are full of ex-pat Americans if I want to eat out. Perhaps they would buy me a drink or something.

Would it help me get a work permit perhaps?

It's kinda a vapid, gee-whiz, ain't it great to be American thing to say. It was also the title of an Oliver Stone film about Ron Kovic, a disabled Vietnam vet, which sorta takes the opposite tack.

Calvin Coolidge was the only president born on the Forth of July (1872).

	* ''"Ward's careful attention to the ironic ontologies of modern military industrial disthaestic gestalt is simultaneously an homage to the jejeune inventions of an assassimated feudo-pluto-hypno-mechastate, and the old, old challenge to disingenuity in all art everywhere. Let's hope he sells 'em by the sack.'' --WikiArtCritic
