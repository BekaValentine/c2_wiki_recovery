I have just made a new ASP-based wiki engine, written in ServerSideJavaScript.

Currently access is employed as wiki page repository.


Features:

* Uses combination of original wiki syntax and mark-down syntax

* Single ActiveServerPages file; just upload and run (with a few lines of configuration)

* Preserve page history and have a built-in diff utility

* RssFeeds

* Pages can be (un)locked, published/revoked, or even removed by admin

* Easy deployment on widely used InternetInformationServer + MicrosoftAccess web host

*Demo Page: http://www.nirvanastudio.org/jswiki/ (Chinese site)
