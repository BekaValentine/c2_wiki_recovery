AFAIK there were useful information in many of the deleted pages

''The pages were likely spam. Unfortunately, WikiWiki offers no convenient access to archives or histories older than a few days, so deleting the pages might not be the right final state for them to 'roll back' to.''

* I used to have a backup as part of my gnoming activities (I have tools to run on offline versions to find possible additional links), but since I seem to have tripped a surge mechanism my access from work is blocked, so I no longer have backups. <fx: shrug> Not sure I care any more.

They were mostly all old past deleted pages, and those that were slated for deletion at some point.  I deleted the spam pages, and yes they were all spam.  And, yes, Wiki was under attack, a spam attack.  A tricky one that was designed to keep WikiGnome''''''s from being able to delete them.  It took a bit of tricky work and a smart little internet browser in order to defeat the attackers.  It was a bit of fury and fun, scurrying to keep up with and then overtake the spammers.  And, as you can see, I/we won that battle (but, of course, not the war). -- Seattle1

I was one of the people helping to delete the spam. I did not see any of the pages which at any stage had old content which I could recover. The strange thing was the wide range of apparently unrelated pages which were being attacked. Also some of the inserted characters did not delete. Thank you to whoever has been countering this so that it has stopped now. -- JohnFletcher
