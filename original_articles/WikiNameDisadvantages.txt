Well... Wikis don't lend themselves to discussing single words, or rather, ideas that are single words. For instance, take the programming language Ruby. It's probably under RubyLanguage; but I'm not a fan of post fixing like that... People say Ruby, not Ruby Language.

But that clarifies the topic, so you know that it's Ruby, the computer language, as opposed to Ruby, the person, or Ruby the operating System, etc.

It also offers some extra search advantages; if one person is interested in computer languages in general, he could search for Language, and find Ruby.

Although I aspire to be famous as just "Ward", and I have made some progress at this as google will report (http://google.com/search?q=ward), on this site I begrudgingly qualify my given name with my family name so as to meet stringent naming rules of my own design. -- WardCunningham
