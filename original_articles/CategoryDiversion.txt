Kind of super category for
* CategoryJoke
* CategoryFoodAndDrink
* OffTopic
* many in CategoryStory

everything, that is a diversion from ProgrammingMatters, often recreational.

Not as strong as OffTopic (which is often head as '''OffTopic''').

And if you don't like this new category (yes, there are too many already), then delete it.

''Hmm - is such a "super" category useful? It's not clear which of the Category Logic pages, say, might belong in it.''
