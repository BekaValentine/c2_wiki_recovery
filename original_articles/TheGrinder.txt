The Grinder is a Java? load-testing framework that is freely available under a BSD-style open-source license.

http://grinder.sourceforge.net/

There is also a book on performance testing using this: ISBN:1904284000 (rather nicely one of the references in the book is this Wiki :)
----
Version 3 is currently in beta and uses scripts written in JythonLanguage rather than in the property file based language it previously used.
----

It's functionally equivalent to Apache JMeter, although JMeter is prettier and more user-friendly. JMeter is also more powerful than Grinder2 when it comes to putting together complex tests involving authentication and cookies.
