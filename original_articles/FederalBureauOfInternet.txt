Evidentally, the UnitedStatesOfAmerica FederalBureauOfInvestigation has plans to route all Internet traffic through its central servers (presumably traveling through US routes). It's not clear from the article if this is actually a routing issue or if it is simply monitoring ISP traffic. Ignoring all the CivilLiberties issues, I wonder what all the technical wrinkles (aside from the obvious ones such as bandwidth and SinglePointOfFailure) there are in such a scheme.

Possible issues:
	* ''Getting major ISPs to agree to mirror traffic to the FBI''
	* ''Bandwidth''
	* ''Encrypted (SecureSocketLayer / PrettyGoodPrivacy) communications''
	* ''How easy is it to set up private routes to bypass known collection points?''
----
I doubt SinglePointOfFailure is a concern, since they don't need to be the middleman in the traffic, they just need a branch off every path to pass through their collection point. OTOH, bandwidth is a concern.

I find it hard to believe that anyone could think this is:
	* Technically Feasible
	* Legal
	* Actually Useful
