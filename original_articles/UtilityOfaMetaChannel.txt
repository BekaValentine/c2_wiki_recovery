So much of the Wiki is becoming meta or TripleMeta discussion about what should or shouldn't go on a page, or conversations between anonymous contributors with no HomePage. Perhaps the community might want to consider some form of MetaChannel for all this.  

'''Standard for this wiki'''

* Create a new page with the same name with the word "Discussion" appended (MoveThreadModeToDiscussionPage, DiscussionPage, DiscussionVsConsensus)
** ''Pro:'' Real easy to do
** ''Pro:'' It is what people have been doing for years
** ''Pro:'' No coding change
** ''Pro:'' Discussion is useful content that should be left around until it is refactored into a document
** ''Con:'' Adds more pages (''easily fixed by more editing')
** ''Con:'' They never seem to go away after their purpose has been served. (''easily fixed by more editing')
** ''Con:'' Usually are rather fuzzy on separation between "thready-discussion" and "meta-discussion" 
** ''Con:'' Discussion is impossible while the discussion page is being vandalised
----
There are some QuickTopic boards relating to this wiki which are effectively meta-channels, and now a WikiChannel mailing list.

'''Other ideas'''

* The Talk namespace, a la WikiPedia
** ''Con:'' Needs change to codebase
** ''Con:'' Rather large social shift
** ''Pro:'' It's rather hard to get blamed for moving meta talk out of a page when there's an accepted namespace for it
** ''Pro:'' Makes separation of DocumentMode and ThreadMode very easy
*** ''Caveat:'' Differentiation between true meta thread, and loosely organized non-meta threadiness is a must. Otherwise, we'll have lots of (well, even more) parallel discussion.

* Double-bar meta separator (SummariesOnTopDiscussionBelow, SeparateThreadsFromContent)
** ''Con:'' Double bars didn't work too well for separating summary from discussion in Wiki's history
** ''Con:'' Probably hard for the entire community to follow
** ''Pro:'' No coding change

* Explicitly temporary meta pages (DeleteMetadiscussion)
** ''Pro:'' Real easy to do
** ''Con:'' The existing examples of these rarely seem to be temporary (''easily fixed by more editing')

(^- this is a double bar on purpose. It got deleted by a well-intentioned editor. Supporting evidence that the DoubleBar idea never really caught on.)

I'm going to begin using this WikiBadge when I see which could benefit from this. This is mainly to get a better sense of just how bad/not bad the problem is. Let it live for a while, if no-one like the tag, it'll be easy enough to do a reverse search later.

Sunir, if you're lurking, I'm especially interested in your thoughts on this, even a cf to an appropriate MeatballWiki page would give me some good reading.

The fourth option above notes that xDiscussion pages never seem to go away as a con. Is that really a bad thing? It is often quite instructive to follow the course of discussion that led to a DocumentMode page. 

''It would depend on whether the discussion is an unrefined form of the document or whether the discussion is just meta on how to structure the document. I can't see much use for the latter.''
