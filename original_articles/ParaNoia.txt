''Paranoia'' is a roleplaying game with a difference. Where as other role playing games  encourage players to work together towards a common goal, Paranoia  encourages backstabbing, double-crossing and bare-faced lying.

''How well would Yourdon's DeathMarch techniques work in this game? If you thought of each ParaNoia "clone" as a project deadline, this might be a good way to testdrive DeathMarch without actually enduring the pain and suffering. On the other hand, if your interest were in GMing a paranoia game, you might consult DeathMarch and BruceWebster's excellent PitfallsOfObjectOrientedDevelopment for plot ideas''--PeterMerel
