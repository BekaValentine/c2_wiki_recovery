Very Large Hashtable is a pattern for persistence following the well-known implementation found in the util package provided by Sun for java.

It supports all the common notions about Hashtable, with these exceptions:

* Every put() is stored persistently, automatically.
* Storage is configurable:
** local file storage
** remote file storage
** remote JDBC storage

WebMacroWiki uses VLH as its storage mechanism.
