Wintek was founded by PaulWintz, a Purdue EE professor
and one-time assistant department head.

He hired GordonLetwin, JimBesemer, HarryChesley,
WardCunningham, DennisLeas, SteveBelter, 
and others to develop software.
JimWilson, DanMoss and others worked on hardware.

This is how many of these folks got involved in the
Microprocessor Revolution.

Eventually Paul retired and sold the company to JimWilson who merged it with SteveBelter.

For a while they sold a PC-based CAE package called HiWire,
which was fairly successful.
