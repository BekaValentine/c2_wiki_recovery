We're determined to win the benefits of XP for our customers and ourselves. Since we are making components for use by third-party developers, we have to use http://www.xpdeveloper.com/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?ProxyCustomer. Not having an OnSiteCustomer means that we can't do full-on XP, and have to do some other things we'd rather not (e.g. write and have reviewed specification documents used to communicate with remote third parties), but we are otherwise rolling out all the practices. We're particularly interested in how UnitTest''''''s and MockObject''''''s can help us write good components and frameworks. -- KeithBraithwaite
