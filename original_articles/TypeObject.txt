TypeObject [1] is a pattern in which an object uses another object as a class.

AnswerMe: I've seen this mentioned as a pattern, particularly in ActiveObjectModel.  Could someone write this up
in pattern form, or at least give a little more detail?

I've seen this pattern mentioned in article about EclipseIde 
http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Java-launch/launching-java.html
An idea is understandable: some object describes a type of another object.
But I agree that this page lacks detailed description of pattern.
BTW, why this pattern cannot be found among categories on
CategoryPattern page?
