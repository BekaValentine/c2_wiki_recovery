See CompoundPatterns. DirkRiehle started using the name CompositeDesignPatterns
to refer to DesignPatterns that combined two or more other smaller DesignPatterns together. JohnVlissides started to follow suit, but soon
after switched to the term CompoundPatterns to avoid confusion with
the CompositePattern.
