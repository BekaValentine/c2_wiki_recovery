Utility, runs under PhpWiki to extract PHP code from Wiki pages and drop it into one or more files for inclusion in Web projects. 
----
I have taken the first steps down this path for a project which I have all but abandoned (attention deficit :) ). Over on my wiki I have a utility called WikiExtract. It crawls my wiki and pulls out specially-formatted PHP code. You can look at (but not run) the source code at: 

* http://www.llamacom.com/~sky/wiki/phpwiki-1.3.3/index.php/WikiExtract (BrokenLink)

Note that it's tested only on my wiki, which runs under PhpWiki, and it only writes into my directory. Feel free to grab it and modify, though.
