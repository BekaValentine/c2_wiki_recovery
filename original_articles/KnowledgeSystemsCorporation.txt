ReedPhillips founded KSC with the intention of offering
products and services in the emerging KnowledgeEngineering
market.  Reed soon found the Smalltalk market to be 
emerging much more rapidly, probably due to the boundless
energy of SamAdams, an early member of the KSC team.

Other contributions, acheivements and inventions include...

	* The SmalltalkApprenticeProgram concept
	* Enterprise modeling with CRC Cards
	* The CoDesign developement tool/environment
	*  ... and more to be sure ...

'''Factoid''': Reed told the graphic artist to make
sure the company logo was easy to draw with the 
desktop equipment of the day.

I always thought our friends in Portland did CRC Cards (WardCunningham, RebeccaWirfsBrock, others). Did KSC do the first Enterprise modeling? Am I growing senile?

Tom, you're misunderstanding this section (Which Ward wrote!)
WardAndKent did invent CRC cards.  However, Sam popularized
their use and introduced them to a wider audience with a multitude
of CRC talks at many, many conferences.

Got it, now. I thought I had fallen into a universe where Ward and Sam worked for IBM and KSC invented CRC (also where Elvis was dead).

But.. Elvis is dead.  He died during the "harmonic convergence" so that he could be reincarnated as Quetzalcoatl.  Watch the old B sci-fi movie 'Q' backwards for details.
