''Dates are often important enough to be remembered " - While in the process of gathering and organizing PersonalInformation, it is a GoodThing on occasion to DateStamp or DateTimeStamp in a WikiPage. This can prove to be useful in the future in recapturing things RelatedButNotLinked. 

WardsWiki does not recognize dates or words containing dates or numbers as linkable artifacts. My own PersonalInformationManager (NysLte) has mechanisms to handle such words and proves very useful since dates are important sign posts and remmmbrance hooks upon which information recovery depends. Think about it for a minute or so. We date any important artifact we endorse or sign. Businesses go to further extremes and record on a receipt or document not only date and time, but also the instrument and agent involved in transactions it makes, whether a receipt, a charge, a payment, or other transaction or ogreements. My information manager must make the recovery of records and data which uses as an indentifier such numeric and attendant matters.
