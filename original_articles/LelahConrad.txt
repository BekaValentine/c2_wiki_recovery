- writes in ALAN.

	* I've been working with ALAN for about three years now, and wrote one minicomp game in ALAN for the WackyComp. I've been working on a murder mystery in ALAN for over two years - I hope someday to make it more than just vaporware, but right now I mostly just thwack away at the bugs.

- has a complete collection of original Infocom games.
