From the back cover:

"What if, instead of a programmer pool, there were a manager pool, from which self-selected software developers chose the leader of their project? Would you be chosen? Can you lead developers to produce more creatively and proficiently?"

----
Don't OpenSource software developers choose their leader to a certain extent? Obviously, LinusTorvalds, GuidoVanRossum, and LarryWall are much better managers of projects than all the managers of projects that never made it.

''Absolutely. This is the very reason that such practices ought to be promulgated in the corporate world at large.''

The secret is to realise that most managers don't have any power. If they don't have anything you need to march towards profitability (or more profitability), then they don't have any say. Things you need include your paycheque, access to the customer, access to marketing and sales, and friends. The last one is important. If a manager has no friends, he is powerless even if he controls your paycheque.

Remember, you as an engineer have a lot of power if you are competent. If you leave, the company takes a severe hit. It may be the case that your manager has less power than you do. So, build your own management team by reporting directly to those with influence. -- AnonymousDonor (to protect the guilty)

This is indeed a valuable lesson all programmers should learn. Managers need you a lot more than you need them. Talented programmers can usually get themselves assigned to whichever manager they prefer. -- KrisJohnson (who doesn't want to protect the guilty)
