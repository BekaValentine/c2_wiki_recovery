I first became interested in patterns in 1982 shortly after I was
married because my wife and I wanted to eventually build our own
house and I had purchased several architecture books including
one entitled A PatternLanguage by ChristopherAlexander. I enjoyed
this book so much that I also bought the TimelessWayOfBuilding.

Both books have influenced my thinking about the software 
I was designing which at the time were
complete systems of business applications written in COBOL or 
Business Basic. Nowadays I am more interested in working with
dynamic object-oriented languages such as Python and Java although I'm trying
to learn Smalltalk and plan to someday delve into Objective-C.

I have been involved with computers since 1972 doing all manner of
things, mostly related to programming or design. I also write a 
weekly column for Internet Week magazine about Internet infrastructure
and a monthly column for Boardwatch about building an ISP service. 
See my web page at
http://www.memra.com for links to my articles.

And although I have experienced many conferencing/discussion systems
over the years, both on the web and off, this Wiki has to be one of the
most enjoyable I have come across to date.

One of these days I plan to incorporate the Wiki ideas into an Internet-based
collaborative work system that I am designing and prototyping in my spare time.

I don't visit here as often as I used (there are other wikis out there to play in now :-) but I still try to keep up with goings on every so often.
