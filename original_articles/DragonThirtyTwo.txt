''My very first computer! Typing in games in basic scared me away from programming for about 5 years. Then math scared me into programming again :-)''

''Didn't it use the ForthLanguage as its OS?''

No, it used TrashEighty Basic (more or less).

The JupiterAce was the one that used ForthLanguage.

Not to be confused with the Motorola / Freescale DragonBall - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freescale_DragonBall, a 32 bit processor (including a MotorolaSixtyEightKay) which was used in many PalmPilot machines from PalmOne until they switched to ARM processors.
