I work as a SoftwareArchitect for Nokia, where I'm starting to use and see the value of UseCases. From 1997 to 2002 I have been in several jobs at Nokia Research Center in Helsinki, Finland. I've always been InterestedInSoftwareArchitecture, and InterestedInUml, particularly in ways to avoid its inconsistencies while keeping its extensible semantics. I have helped GalalGalal develop the theory of SoftwareArchitectonics.

I have published a few articles, and I'm doing my PhD with the Royal University of Groningen in TheNetherlands. My supervisor is JanBosch.

I also write non technical articles, which you can find from http://alessandromaccari.com/ (click on articles). I'm in the process of writing a book about FinnishPeople, and this is what I think is my best piece: 42 GoodReasonsToBeInFinland.
