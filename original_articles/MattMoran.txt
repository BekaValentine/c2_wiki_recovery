''Hi Matt. Are you here for a while?  Or are you just a FlyingVisitor?''

Hopefully here for a while, if that's okay. I'm here more to learn than to teach because so far I've mainly been maintaining other people's code & diagnosing what went wrong when it falls apart, rather than designing and building stuff from scratch, but I believe I may have a thing or two to say on occasion.
