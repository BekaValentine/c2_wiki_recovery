HyperCard simplified the computational model for GUI applications with simple single-user databases.

WardCunningham's WikiWikiWeb simplified the computational model for Web applications with simple multi-user text databases.

What is the HyperCard or the WikiWiki equivalent for WebServices?

I think a start is to focus on simple notations for sequential processes and TupleSpace''''''s for coordination.
