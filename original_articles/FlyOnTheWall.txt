... after the AuthorReadsTheWork, the reviewers are
seated in the AuthorsCircle, ready to give feedback
on the work.  What does the author do now?

'''*  *  *'''

'''The author should hear the comments directly,'''
'''and should know who said them, so they'''
'''have the fullest possible context.'''

'''Yet the comments are likely to be more frank if'''
'''the author isn't present.'''

'''But too much frankness contradicts SafeSetting.'''

'''Therefore:'''

'''Ask the author to step out of the AuthorsCircle and'''
'''become a FlyOnTheWall.  During VolunteerSummarizesTheWork,'''
'''PositiveFeedbackFirst, and SuggestionsForImprovement,'''
'''the author:'''
	* '''is not referred to by name, but is instead called: 'the author';'''
	* '''may absolutely not speak;'''
	* '''should not make eye contact with the reviewers (which is largely the responsibility of the reviewers)'''

'''*  *  *'''

This helps the
reviewers to focus on the material by putting the author
out of sight, out of mind.
The author can still appreciate PositiveFeedbackFirst,
but is distanced from the personal impact of
SuggestionsForImprovement.
