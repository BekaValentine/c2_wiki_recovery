''Context:''

You are designing an auditory display to allow a user to monitor the activity of a potentially dynamic system.

''Problem:''

You need to allow the user to perform other tasks and still be continuously and sufficiently aware of the state of the system.

''Forces:''

* It is likely that the user's primary attention will be on other tasks.
* Whenever a change occurs, the user will need to know what part of the system has altered state, and by how much.

''Solution:''

Sonify various processes within the system. Systems that are working perfectly/desirably should exhibit familiar, non-annoying sounds. To indicate undesirable status of processes, one might use lower tones, dissonance, out-of-time rhythm, minor scales, etc.

''Rationale:''

People can listen to a sonification while performing other tasks. It is usually possible to detect minor changes in  frequency, dissonance, rhythm, musical key, etc.

Interesting. I've been toying with the idea of making a server room sound like an aviary for several years now. -- JohnDuncan
