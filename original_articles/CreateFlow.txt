One aspect of good writing is to create flow for the reader. 
The text has to have a pace, a point and a purpose to it, allowing
the reader to follow the writing's flow, and thus get into flow.
Links can be used to great effect here, allowing side-arguments
to be put on separate pages (with return links) so they are there
if the reader wants to know more, but don't break the main line
of narrative. ''ThePleasuresOfCounting'' by T.W. Kï¿½rner
(ISBN  0-52-156823-4) uses side-notes, rather than footnotes, 
and this is very effective in helping keep the pace at whatever
the reader wants.
