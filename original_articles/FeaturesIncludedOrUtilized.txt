''Why invent a new place to put a wheel when you can safely use one already provided?'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140513

While creating my own PrivateLanguageApplications, it was realized that real-estate is available when using MultipleMonitors whereby WantedFeatures can be made available to the InsideApplication by utilizing features within an already existing application, providing the UtilizationModelMethodAndStructure for accomplishing the desired end within the application, while leaving the work of providing and displaying the features outside of it.

This is not a new idea, just one not recently employed within programs written on my Computer, and displayed on the considerable Monitor Space I have available. It can be employed as a new approach to refactoring and upgrading old procedures, rewriting to borrow and employ processing and display resources from the outside.
