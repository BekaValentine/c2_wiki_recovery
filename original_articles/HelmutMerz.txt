I am an "IT-Consultant" - whatever that may mean - living in southern Germany not far from Munich. 

In August 2001 I started work on my own "kind of WikiClone" written in PythonLanguage. I called it "CyberPublishing" and it's available under the GNU GPL. I just (2002-02-03) published a major release (0.5). For more information see http://cyberdev.org/cpy and http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpy.

You may contact me on mailto:h.merz@cyberconcepts.de or take a look at http://www.cyberconcepts.de (in German). --HelmutMerz

Some remarks on ExtremeProgramming from the time when I discovered XP and this wiki:

When I discovered XP (and wiki) in May 1999 I got some sort of "that may really heal the world" feeling. I worked as a programmer and project manager in software development at a software house for eight years and were not very happy about how we did it (though I always liked it); and the next five years (as CIO at a publishing house) I often "suffered" from the products people from software houses installed (or tried to install) at the company I worked at (and they often talked about their QA departments...).

There is a real global challenge on software development concerning flexibility and quality, and in my opinion XP presents the first methodology to cope with this challenge.

As I now work as an IT consultant with a focus on IT organisation and OO (that now means Java and - increasingly important - Python) development and training, such ideas like XpConsulting and XpTraining (or even ExtremeConsulting / ExtremeTraining?) come to my mind. One important thing will be PromotingXp.
