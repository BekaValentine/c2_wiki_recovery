Something I wrote up for an ERP system framework serving dozens of different plants:

This framework is best if kept simple.  Simple is easier and simple is better.

Keep the scope limited.  Don't try to include everything.  Prioritize your focus.

Keep the model open.  Don't try to make the whole world closed and consistent.  Plan for other systems and ideas to link in.

Accept some ambiguity.  Don't introduce precision where it isn't needed.  Precision can be a burden.

Keep to the essentials.  Don't let custom features corrupt the core.  Handle them in local applications of the framework.
