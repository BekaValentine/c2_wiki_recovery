I've long been looking for the perfect wiki to use as a personal note-taking and project management tool. In rough order, I've tried:
	* EddiesWiki: base feature set; stable; requires separate server and browser interface; no longer developed as far as I can see. [''But WxWikiServer exists.'']
	* NoteBook: doesn't support WikiWords; modal; active development; nice hooks
	* NoteWiki: believe it or not, I used this simplistic tool for a long time. First modeless DesktopWiki I found. No formatting, and not actively developed.
	* PepysWiki: Very nice UI, but flaky and prone to data loss; no longer developed.
	* WikidPad: modeless editing (added mode for HTML export), tons of features, actively developed; OpenSource; slightly dodgy formatting.
	* ZuluPad: modeless, FAST, supports any kind of links, but zero formatting.
	* TiddlyWiki: strange self-modifying JavaScript; executes in-browser. I can't quite bring myself to trust the self-modifying aspect.
	* TwikiClone: big, over-structured kitchen sink wiki. I use it at work, but the rigid structure seems to lead to disuse.

So far, the closest thing to ideal I've found has been WikidPad.

But here's what I really want in SuperWhizzyUltimatePersonalWikiToolPro (SWUPWTP):
	* Modeless operation with automatic WikiWord recognition, but bracketless support for non-CamelCase wiki words
	* Basic formatting: tagless support (like PepysWiki) for numbered and bullet lists, bold, italic, strikeout, and headers should suffice
	* PocketPc version optimized for that platform
	* OpenSource, so I can fix bugs and hack on it
	* Low resource consumption, so I can leave it running all the time and show/hide it with an AcceleratorKey
	* Modeless "what-links-here" display
	* Category support (what links here would suffice, but baked-in tagging in a separate namespace would be better)
	* Uncluttered UI like PepysWiki and ZuluPad (and unlike SdiDesk)
	* Completely drivable from the keyboard, with one-stroke forward/back support (WikidPad lacks this)
	* Auto-linkification of URLs
	* Fast full-text search
	* Incremental in-page search

Nice-to-have features:
	* Some functionality for simple tables
	* Versioning
	* Sync with PocketPc version and offsite backup (scp, ftp, webdav, what have you)
	* Support for embedded images
What I don't need:
	* Multi-user support
	* Export to XML/HTML
	* Tree view

Every couple of months, I re-browse the links on PersonalWiki, but nobody has implemented SWUPWTP yet.
