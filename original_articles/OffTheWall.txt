''adjective phrase'' meaning random, without benefit of due process. Said of a remark or utterance. The greater the apparent lack of connection between the current circumstance and a remark, the more off-the-wall is the remark. ''Zany'' and ''crazy'' are near-synonyms, but these terms carry an air of lunacy missing from "off-the-wall"; it can be difficult to distinguish an off-the-wall utterance from a serious remark based on delivery alone. See NonSequitur.
