The main point now is that -- I'm here, I'm fumbling around, and I'm seeing what's what.

And I've installed my own Wiki at home!  Good stuff!

''Welcome to Wiki, would you mind telling us alittle more about yourself?
What flavour of Wiki did you endup choosing for home use?''

Curiously, I was just on my way beck here to say just that.  I'm a programmer in NYC, and I've been working a lot with Python stuff for home projects, and Java stuff for money-earning projects.  I ended up trying Wiki at first at work to keep track of notes and information about projects instead of letting stuff archive in the email system.  I chose TWiki since it was labelled as a more 'corporate' Wiki.  I also installed it at home to play with.  When I upgraded my Redhat systems at home, TWiki broke due to the upgraded Perl rpm, and since I didn't have much invested yet in the TWiki instances, was learning Python, and didn't want to get into the Perl, I installed for MoinMoin.  So now TWiki is running in read-only mode, and MoinMoin is the active repository.  So far, I've been happy with MoinMoin -- it's giving me everything I need at home and at work.
