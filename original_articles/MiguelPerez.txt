I teach a Graduate course and I planning to use wiki concepts as a way to build knowledge in small groups. I am interested in know how groups behave and organize themselves to share and construct knowledge. If any of you have any experience in this topic o want to share some ideas please reach me at mailto:maperez@campus.mty.itesm.mx. Thanks
