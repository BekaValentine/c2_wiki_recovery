Wishlists for specialized WikiEngines.

'''New features'''

	1 ConceptMapWiki, based on Concept Maps
	1 GoogleTagWiki, a wiki, that scales with Google in tandem, due to letting handle the links by the Google Search Engine.
	1 TagWiki, a generalization of a GoogleTagWiki
	1 GoogleTagWiki, a wiki, that scales with Google in tandem, due to letting handle the links by the Google Search Engine.
	1 PageTemplates. I'd like the (X)HTML not hard-coded into the script; I'd like to have a separate file where I can code out one or more templates to use. -- CortlandHaws  PmWiki does this nicely. -- JasonGrossman

	1 P2P Wiki. The pages are distributed over many machines.

	1 VrmlWikiForum

	1 a multimedia WikiEngine for a ScienceFictionWikiForum (WikiNehesa will accept image files, and display them. One could even use this to display a movie file. Never tried it, but I welcome inquiries from interested persons. Hmmm, sound files, presumably .mp3, that's an interesting idea. Any multimedia mavens out there interested? Visit my persoanl homepage here and email me! -- KirkBailey)

	1 Engine for ''really'' open+free projects development (ie the Wiki way) to kick SourgeForge's bloated primitive joke (i.e. CVS et al.) ''Some user stories for this would be enlightening.'' [See WikiAsSourceControlRepository on MeatballWiki, or WikiIde]

	1 RealTimeWikiDesign

	1 UnicodeWikiEngines  

	1 "I have a wiki on my laptop, my PDA, and on my webserver. I'd like a way in which I can keep all three of them synched up in part or in whole." -- LesOrchard http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WikiWikiSync ''If you're in *nix world, why not use rsync? -- AmeenDausha''

'''New languages'''

	1 A wiki in JayLanguage.

	1 Server side JavaScript. (I made a wiki in under 5K using JavaScript (once hopeful 5K contest entrant), but it's kinda stupid methinks. It was limited by the fact that it was stored in a cookie, and not accessible anywhere else but client side -- MarkCanlas)

	1 DelphiLanguage ( DelphiWiki ) open source implementation of Wiki would be very nice.

	1 Wysiwyg ( WysiwygWiki ) open source implementation of Wiki for the WikiIlliterate.


'''New Infrastructures''' to 

* connect Wikis
	1 A WikiAnnotationMediator

* make the system of note cards in http://secondlife.com a WikiEngine. This wish comes from http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SecondLife, where community-related stuff is on the focus.

I've created a wiki to collect wiki feature ideas, notes on their development status, who's planning to implement them, feature advocacy, etc., etc.,.  http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/ -- LionKimbro

Let's divide this into WikiFeaturesWanted and WikiLanguagesWanted. Within the languages area, there's probably enough within the scope of Java to make WikiJavaWanted. The features page should describe Wiki features wanted in small enough terms to serve as usable CRC cards for a Wiki development team, regardless of language or platform. Perhaps algorithms and data structures could be discussed in general terms ("users can search the database of publication dates to obtain a list of all pages edited within the given date range"), but not in detail ("a red-black balanced B-tree holds date entries as Julian offsets from the Unix base date"). They would also serve as the basis for documentation to be delivered to users of a system. The languages page would deal with implementing those features in a variety of languages.

You know you've earned your PropellerBeanie when "a red-black balanced B-tree holds date entries as Julian offsets from the Unix base date" is easier for you to understand than "users can search the database of publication dates to obtain a list of all pages edited within the given date range". -- JeffDay

(Fhat the Wuck?!? Sorry, still just a hacker. -KirkBailey )

I suppose my question is: Why not just use WikiFeatures wiki? (http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/)

	* http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/FeatureSummaries - what's entered so far.
	* http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/IdeasToPlace - a place to put ideas ''quickly.''
