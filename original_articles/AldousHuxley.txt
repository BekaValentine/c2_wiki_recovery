Novelist and essayist, born in Godalming, Surrey, the grandson of T.H. Huxley. He studied at Oxford, lived mainly in Italy in the 1920's, (where he met and befriended D.H. Lawrence) and moved to California in 1937. His early writing included poetry, short stories, and literary journalism, but his reputation was made with his satirical novels Crome Yellow (1921) and Antic Hay (1923). Later novels include Point Counter Point and, his best-known work, Brave New World (1932), where he warns of the dangers of dehumanization in a scientific age. His later writing became more mystical in character, as in Eyeless in Gaza (1936) and Time Must Have a Stop (1944), while Island (1962) is an optimistic Utopia. 

The Perennial Philosophy (1945) is a comparative study of mysticism.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Perennial_Philosophy)

Huxley died the same day as CsLewis, but neither event got a lot of press at the time as it was also the day JFK was assassinated.

By the way - somebody labeled this page as "off topic." Obviously someone who has either not read Brave New World or is not a technologist. Avoiding the BraveNewWorld syndrome is partly the responsibility of those of us who develop the technology.
