A WikiTag for pages that might be more at home on TheAdjunct than here.  This might engender a discussion on the appropriateness of the move.

(Note: this may also be requesting a split refactoring; OnTopic stuff to remain on the page, and OffTopic stuff to TheAdjunct.)

Related to the more general WikiTag "MoveItElsewhere".

Approximately 45 pages have been flagged this way as of September 2006.
