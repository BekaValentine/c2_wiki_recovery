'''''Informal Future Of Programming Ideas'''''

What is the future of programming? How will programming be performed in the future?

What part of programming will require the services of the professional programmer, and what part will be done by DomainExpert''''''s enabled by ProgrammingInterfaces to produce programs dealing with their own domain?

* This already happens, to some extent.  Zillions of accountants and the like use spreadsheets to program in various numerical computations (even ignoring things like VBA and macros, anything but the most non-trivial spreadsheet is programming).  A few of 'em can manage SQL queries from the company database servers.  Numerous ExpertSystem''''''s out there are tantamount to a highly tailored DomainSpecificLanguage (one which is ''truly'' domain-specific, in that it's unsuitable for general purpose programming).  In the past, tools like HyperCard and the like were used by non-trained programmers.  '''In most cases, the DomainExpert doesn't realize that s/he is doing programming, and many programmers (who use traditional domain-independent programming languages) fail to recognize that either.'''



Where are programming languages heading? ''See FutureOfProgrammingLanguages.'' How much of the programming effort will be internet related versus enterprise related?

Just what are the ideas that are most likely to succeed in future computing scenarios?

Can this wiki take on the future? Is such an endeavor worth the time and effort? Will it influence or lead to anything?

Perhaps the computer of the future will break away from simple binary state logic. Logic that is if or else based. Perhaps the core of software might entertain the idea of a "maybe bit"?  ''See ThreeValuedLogic.  TVL is useful, and you have to deal with it if you ever do database stuff in StructuredQueryLanguage, but it has issues...''

TVL is the future? Oh please no! Shoot me now!

Don't we already have topics about the future of IT around here somewhere?
