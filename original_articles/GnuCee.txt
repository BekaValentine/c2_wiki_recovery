CeeLanguage with the extensions supported by gcc (GnuCompilerCollection). Many of these extensions are in C99; of those that are not, the most useful and/or interesting are:

* GoTo labels as values (used by some VirtualMachine implementations),
* typeof(...) to refer to the type of an expression,
* nested functions (see NestedScopes) with LexicalScoping,
* compound statements as expressions.

This compiler will also compile ObjectiveCee and (on MacOsx) ObjectiveCeePlusPlus.
