Compare with AlternativeProtocols such as AmoebaFlip and PlanNineIp. -- AluoNowu

Interestingly (from ProofOfCorrectness): "A formal model of TCP/IP discovered bugs in the protocol, even though it has been in use for years!"

* AnswerMe please: ''URL/citation?''
* I think AluoNowu was referring to the last line of the abstract in this paper: http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi04/tech/full_papers/musuvathi/musuvathi_html/main.html, which reads: ''We have implemented these techniques in CMC, a C model checker [30] and applied the result to the Linux TCP/IP implementation, finding four errors in the protocol implementation.''  What bugs were there would surely by now have been fixed...

There is no such a thing as BugFreeSoftware.
