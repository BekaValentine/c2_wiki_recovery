The best way to celebrate a milestone of an ExtremeProgramming project, conclude an XP course, bootcamp, or any other XP event is to have an ExtremeDimSum.

To have ExtremeDimSum, find a Chinese restaurant that has DimSum for lunch. Make reservations for N + 1 people, where N is your team size (includes customers and project manager/funder).  Ask for a round table with a lazy Susan. 

Rules:
	* Food is collectively shared, but only one person orders. Ordinarily this person is HakanErdogmus. In his absence, the coach or the next wisest person in the team orders. 
	* Project manager/funder can eat, but cannot order.
	* Customers and the project manager/funder split the tab. If this is a course, coaches/trainers pay :-) (New Rule)
''I like it.  Instructors should provide a meal during ExtremeGraduation ceremonies!  -- RobMyers''
	* Always conclude an ExtremeDimSum with deep-fried sesame balls stuffed with lotus paste. 
	* Don't consume the fortune cookies on the spot. Take them with you. You'll need them for the next iteration. 
	* Team members who has an MSG allergy or who require kosher food are exempt; vegetarians (and people who don't eat pork) can be accommodated.
	* Always order Chinese broccoli with garlic and ginger (anybody knows the Mandarin name?) in ample quantities.
''JoshuaKerievsky knows.  Ask him.  It's rather amusing to hear (and watch) him speak Mandarin.  -- RobMyers'' 

''The cantonese for Chinese broccoli is "gailan".  Of course, the dim sum here in PortlandOregon is nowhere near as good as Toronto.  (So says my wife who is Chinese, lives here now, used to live there....)--ScottJohnson''

Why the extra reservation? Seems to me like YouArentGonnaNeedIt? -- KarlKnechtel

Touche! I swear I had a reason, which I thought was a pretty good one at the time! But if I can't remember it now, it can't be that important, so YAGNI might as well apply. -- HakanErdogmus
