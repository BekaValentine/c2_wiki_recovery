In my opinion, the "see also" list should be at the top instead of the bottom. That way, one can see if they are looking at the right or best page before they start perusing. Perhaps same with categories. Whaddyathink? -- Anon

If it's the wrong page, both the top and bottom should be visible at the same time, thanks to the refactorings of a WikiGnome.

Everything should go at the top so the reader can see everything immediately.
