From the preface (http://www.dommelen.net/quantum2/style_a/To.html) and the ''Why this book?'' (http://www.dommelen.net/quantum2/style_a/nt_whybook.html#sec:nt_whybook):

	 :	"[This book was] writ­ten by an en­gi­neer for en­gi­neers. As an en­gi­neer­ing pro­fes­sor with an en­gi­neer­ing back­ground, this is the book I wish I would have had when I started learn­ing real quan­tum me­chan­ics a few years ago.... This book is not a pop­u­lar ex­po­si­tion: quan­tum me­chan­ics can only be de­scribed prop­erly in the terms of math­e­mat­ics; sug­gest­ing any­thing else is crazy. But the as­sumed back­ground in this book is just ba­sic un­der­grad­u­ate cal­cu­lus and physics as taken by all en­gi­neer­ing un­der­grad­u­ates.

	 :	"It is quan­tum me­chan­ics that de­scribes how na­ture truly be­haves; clas­si­cal physics is just a sim­plis­tic ap­prox­i­ma­tion of it that can be used for some com­pu­ta­tions de­scrib­ing macro­scopic sys­tems....  [This] book is de­signed to be much eas­ier to read and un­der­stand than com­pa­ra­ble texts. Quan­tum me­chan­ics is in­her­ently math­e­mat­i­cal, and this book ex­plains it fully. But the math­e­mat­ics is only cov­ered to the ex­tent that it pro­vides in­sight in quan­tum me­chan­ics....  The book was pri­mar­ily writ­ten for en­gi­neer­ing grad­u­ate stu­dents who find them­selves caught up in nano tech­nol­ogy."
