Look for these at the upcoming OOPSLA.  Extreme programmers have elaborate skin-colored tattoos all over their faces and bodies.  Rather like Maori tattoos, except Extreme. The ExtremeProgrammingTattoo can only be awarded by an ExtremeProgrammingMaster.  This year I'll be tattooing the women, because Kent wanted to do the men.  --RonJeffries

''Is there any other way we can discern the XPers?  Everyone I saw at OOPSLA last year was covered with skin-colored tattoos.''

Yes, there is.

''Skin colored ? I thought the tattoos were flesh-tone.'' 

The old ones were, but we upgraded.
