I'm interested in a sketch of the accumulated wisdom about ImplementingLisp.

Here are some specific questions I've wondered about:

* How is lambda implemented?
* What's at the very lowest level, where the code meets the metal/OS.
* I've heard rumors of a ByteCode set for Lisp. Does anyone know of one, and how it was implemented?
* Is there an open-source Lisp, and if so, a roadmap through its innards?

Here is an attempt at describing a basic blueprint for a Lisp interpreter.  It is not the only way to structure the system, but it seems to be a simple way for a hobbyist implementation.

There is a 323 line implementation of this blueprint, with no GarbageCollection and very little error checking, at http://www.sonoma.edu/users/l/luvisi/sl3.c

'''GarbageCollection''':
*This is closely tied to the list structured memory.  It can be ignored if you aren't going to be doing real work.

'''List structured memory''':
*You need a way to manipulate cons cells, symbols, integers, primitives, and user defined procedures in your implementation language.

'''Environment handling''':
	Lookup:	Find the value of a symbol in an environment.
	Extension:	Create a new environment given an old environment, some symbols, and their new values.

'''Input/Output''':
	read:	RecursiveDescentParser for reading in EssExpression''''''s.
	print:	Simple recursive procedure to print out EssExpression''''''s.

'''Evaluator (EvalApply)''':
	eval:	Evaluate a form.  Looks up symbols.  Handles special forms.  For applications, delegates evaluation of subforms to evlis and delegates the actual application to apply.
	apply:	Unwraps user defined procedures, adjusting environment appropriately and delegates evaluation of body to begin.  Applies primitives in an implementation dependant manner.
	evlis:	Takes a list of forms.  Evaluates each one (using eval) and returns a list of the results.
	begin:	Takes a list of forms.  Evaluates each one (using eval) and returns the result of the last evaluation.

'''Interface''':
	ReadEvalPrintLoop:	Evaluates (print (eval (read))) over and over so that the user (probably you) can type in Lisp expressions and see what they evaluate to.

If you are writing your LispLanguage interpreter in LispLanguage itself, you get the GarbageCollection, the list structured memory, and the I/O for free.  This is called a MetaCircularEvaluator.  There is a partial MetaCircularEvaluator in WhyLisp.  StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms has a good discussion of this process, as does "The Art Of The Interpreter" (see below).

If you are using something like CeeLanguage for your implementation, you can start by implementing just the list structured memory, read, and print.  Then run (print (read)) in a loop.  The other parts can then be added to the working system incrementally.

If you are happy without TailCallOptimization or FirstClassContinuation''''''s (ContinuationExplanation, ContinuationImplementation), then you can just go ahead and write the evaluator recursively as described above.

If you want TailCallOptimization, then you will either need to tail call optimize the interpreter or represent the control stack explicitly.  If you write a MetaCircularEvaluator in SchemeLanguage, you're most of the way there.  In a language like CeeLanguage or CommonLisp which has GoTo, the interpreter can be tail call optimized by inlining begin() and apply() into eval(), and replacing eval()'s tail recursive calls with assignments and GoTo''''''s that target the beginning of the function.  ParadigmsOfArtificialIntelligenceProgramming explains how to do this, and there is an example in C at http://www.sonoma.edu/users/l/luvisi/sl5.c

If you want FirstClassContinuation''''''s, then you have a few options:
* If you have TailCallOptimization, you can convert the source program into ContinuationPassingStyle (using a CpsTransformation) before interpreting it, so the control stack is represented explicitly in the transformed source code.  ''Lambda The Ultimate Declarative'' (ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-379.pdf) and ''RABBIT: A Compiler for SCHEME'' (ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AITR-474.pdf) have good descriptions of how to convert SchemeLanguage code into ContinuationPassingStyle.
* If you are writing your interpreter in a language which has TailCallOptimization, you can write the interpreter in ContinuationPassingStyle.  When creating a continuation for the interpreted program, you just encapsulate the interpreter's current continuation.  See http://fresh.homeunix.net/~luke/misc/foo1.lisp for an example of doing this.  Also, StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms describes this idea in their description of the "Amb Evaluator", although it is in the context of implementing backtracking in the interpreted language, not continuations.
* You can represent the control stack explicitly in the evaluator, so that it can be easily encapsulated in and restored from a FirstClassContinuation.  See the ExplicitControlEvaluator in StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms and the SchemeLanguage interpreter in ''An Interpreter for Extended Lambda Calculus'' (ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-349.pdf) (written in MacLisp, but it should be understandable by someone familiar with CommonLisp) for good examples of how to do this.  If you build a SECD machine based implementation (see below), you can wrap up the current state of the machine in a continuation, and restore it when the continuation is called, adding the continuation's argument to the stack after restoration.

Implementing FirstClassContinuation''''''s is probably not worth the effort for your first crack at an evaluator.
* Especially if implementing in a lower level language; it is quite hard (at least conceptually, with many, many pitfalls) to implement full-fledged '''efficient''' FirstClassContinuation''''''s from scratch in e.g. CeeLanguage. Doing so really well requires significantly more understanding of multiple topics, than if one's implementation language is Scheme (although there are pitfalls there, too). See LispInSmallPieces for deepening of understanding.

'''Some books that may be of interest''':
	LISP 1.5 Programmer's Manual:	This is the grandaddy of all Lisp books.  It describes the implementation of LispOnePointFive, one of the first full featured Lisp implementations.  Available for free online from http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book
	StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms:	Contains a thorough treatment of a MetaCircularEvaluator, a description of translating Lisp code into instructions for a register machine (aka a normal computer), and a good discussion of implementing list structured memory.  Brief treatment of GarbageCollection.  Weak on I/O.  Available free online from http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html
	LispInSmallPieces:	Includes multiple interpreters and two compilers (one to ByteCode, and one to CeeLanguage) for SchemeLanguage.  Weak on GarbageCollection, I/O, and the implementation of list structured memory.
	ParadigmsOfArtificialIntelligenceProgramming:	Includes a SchemeLanguage interpreter and compiler.  The compiler targets a virtual machine which is also implemented.  Weak on GarbageCollection, I/O, and the implementation of list structured memory.
	AnatomyOfLisp:	Out of print.  Decent treatment of all aspects of a Lisp system.  Discusses implementation techniques for older features that are not often present in current Lisp systems, such as DynamicBinding and computed gotos in the "program feature".
	GarbageCollectionBook:	''Garbage Collection -- Algorithms for Automatic Dynamic Memory Management'', by Richard Jones and Rafael Lins. ISBN 0471941484 .  Strong on GarbageCollection (heh heh).  Discussion of implementing list structured memory, and particularly latent typing, is woven through the book.
	EssentialsOfProgrammingLanguages:	Develops interpreters and a compiler for a language that has SchemeLanguage like semantics but a more conventional syntax.  Good coverage of ContinuationPassingStyle and how to implement dynamic-wind.  Decent coverage of input.  Weak on GarbageCollection, output, and the implementation of list structured memory.
	FunctionalProgrammingApplicationAndImplementation:	by Peter Henderson.  Has a good description of the SECD machine (see below), including an outline of a VirtualMachine implementation in a PascalLanguage like PseudoCode, a compiler (written in LispKit Lisp) that compiles his LispKit Lisp to the SECD VirtualMachine, and a little bit on I/O, list structured memory and GarbageCollection.  Unfortunately, the only mention I've found of TailCallOptimization is in an exercise 6.6 on page 196 where it asks the student to explain how "AP RTN" is redundant and how to fix it.  The dialect which it implements is a little bit weird.  For example, the scheme code "(letrec ((fact (lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1))))))) fact)" would look like "(letrec fact (fact lambda (n) (if (= n 0) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1))))))".

'''Implementations (open-source)'''

Google for "SECD machine" for one possible implementation. Also look for LispKit, using which I implemented a variant of the LispLanguage in a weekend.
*"The Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions" by PeterLandin is the original paper that describes the SECD machine.  It also introduced "closures".  http://www3.oup.co.uk/computer_journal/hdb/Volume_06/Issue_04/060308.sgm.abs.html (BrokenLink, but the WaybackMachine has it http://web.archive.org/web/20030106035107/http://www3.oup.co.uk/computer_journal/hdb/Volume_06/Issue_04/060308.sgm.abs.html)
*''Functional Programming Application and Implementation'' by Peter Henderson ISBN 0133315797 describes both the normal SECD machine, and some extended variations with support for backtracking and LazyEvaluation.
*''Recursive Programming Techniques'' by W. H. Burge ISBN 0201144506 has a decent description of the SECD machine.
* LispMe (http://www.lispme.de/lispme/index.html), a SchemeLanguage implementation for PalmOs, is based on the SECD machine (http://www.lispme.de/lispme/doc/lm_hood.htm).

Some of the above links are taken from sometimes-stale package documentation and may be broken links, but nonetheless, only software that was available '''somewhere''' on the net as of Dec 2003 is listed, even if I neglected to keep a note of its new location after I searched it out and downloaded it.
