'''''The Story Thus Far'''''

OnceUponaTime, MikeSmith seemed to be inactive on the wiki, Another''''''Mike''''''Smith was quite active. Another''''''Mike''''''Smith contacted MikeSmith to see if he could 'take over' the page. Once permission was obtained, Another''''''Mike''''''Smith dropped his 'first name'. 

''Heh, yeah, and then'' The''''''New''''''Mike''''''Smith ''(that's me) kinda went away, too, sorta.  ;-)  I've been doing the QuickChangesJunkie thing, but haven't had a whole lot so say lately.'' -- MikeSmith

'''''Moved''''' '' '''here from MikeSmith, after the switch from Another''''''Mike''''''Smith'''''

''OK then, I heard back from the fellow who "had" this page, and he's given me the go-ahead, so that's it. Another''''''Mike''''''Smith is no more; he's now just plain MikeSmith.  I think I'm going to leave all my old sigs in place, and just redirect through Another''''''Mike''''''Smith to this page, unless anyone thinks that's unwise. -- MikeSmith'' (It's unwise only when/until another MikeSmith shows up. -- SeanOleary)

Welcome! (I guess that's what you say in a situation like this.) Do other folks have permission to make the name changes as they see them? It would almost feel like rewriting history. -- SteveHowell

''Uh...sure, if you like. I guess I'll probably end up doing the same.''

He didn't change his name, He just dropped his first name.

''Hee, hee. Someday, I will evolve into a mononominal, then maybe someday just an unpronounceable symbol, perhaps 'ï¿½' - although then, I'll only be able to participate in Wikis that have been modified to recognize a solitary 0xA7 as a WikiName.''

''Did you change your cookie to just'' MikeSmith? ''Oops! No. Thanks for pointing this out.''

If the original MikeSmith left any signatures lying around Wiki, you should probably remove them so that they become anonymous, and not linked to you.  ''Good point, thanks!''

Perhaps just change them to Old''''''Mike''''''Smith? ''Turns out there aren't any, anyway.''

2002-04-15: Thanks to a fit of procrastination, I've hunted down the remaining Another''''''Mike''''''Smith backlinks. The only ones that remain are the various ChangesIn pages and the assorted .*MikeSmith.* pages. -- SeanOleary ''Hey, thanks!'' -- MikeSmith
