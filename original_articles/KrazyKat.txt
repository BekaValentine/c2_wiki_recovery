George Herriman's "Krazy Kat" (1911), a comic drama of love and rejection in the manner of a surreal commedia dell'arte, proved a hit with intellectuals because of its wit and advanced style.

''KrazyKat, the hapless lover, represents the Ego. Ignatz Mouse, who hurls a brick into K's head every other strip, represents the Id. The brick makes KK feel pangs of love for Ignatz. And Offisa Pup, who arrests Ignatz for this crime, represents the Super Ego.''

Furtherless, Herriman, although allowing himself to be misclassified as Greek, was a light-skinned black. One wonders what other geniuses of his era we missed out on, with darker skin, and a genius in some field besides sports or music.
