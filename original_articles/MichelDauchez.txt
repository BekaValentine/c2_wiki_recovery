I found Wiki perfect to my taste and I found also people that cannot understand it. That's a lesson.

My house is near Paris, a light city. Family, one cat in the yard, some trees and flowers.
My job is with people paid for the code they produce. I can read, spell, appreciate, criticize it, I sometimes write scripts and queries and I like it (when it works). The oo things have a great appeal, a friend of mine says it seems that objects are the natural language of mind.

I loved the BeautyIsOurBusiness page and the subject is of great importance.
Maybe the people who added comments to that page should put a link to pages of beautiful code they wrote or met. But maybe it belongs to the company and not to them. However, maybe they are only interested in free substances.
- - Your ideas be welcome.

I still suggest some ideas, as to take a look at cbn ComputationalBeautyOfNature.

- - This should go to its own Wiki page, related to CategoryBookmarks 
-- OKa.

2c (cunning) people are proud of what they done and Wiki is indeed nicely put up, whatever the code.

I'd like to put here my email but what if it becomes subject to more spam? Maybe I shall delete every mail from people unknown unless the subject is this word now famous, Wiki. [''Though spam isn't impossible, I've come across no complaints of spam related to giving an email address on wiki.'']

The paragraph below is candidate to go in the Sand-Booox : 
To be seen (never heard) the best way is -
To sign texts everywhere.
To create favourite links in one own's page, so it shall be found, e.g. in FindPage (good).
To post well formed samples of code, nice gifs (howTo_?), criticize SmallTalk, etc.
- - your advice -
A+

Would you care to discuss MathQuizOne? -- GeraldYoung
