Comes with a small-footprint hemispherical pod and a multi-adjustable LED screen with an either 15", 17" or 20" diagonal.  Downsides are that they are only available with G4 processors (rather than G5), they are limited to 1GB RAM, and, if you put out the keyboard's rear feet to get some angle on it, the CD/DVD tray door can whack into the keyboard when the tray is opened.  Like the previous G4 cube model, they operate essentially silently.  If you value your deskspace more than raw processing power of dual G5's, they are a great little machine to have around.  Comes with MacOs 10.3 (Panther) of course.
