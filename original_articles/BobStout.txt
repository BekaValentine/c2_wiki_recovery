I met BobStout on FidoNet's C_ECHO when I was cutting my teeth. He was one of the many JediMasters who trained me in the art of JediProgramming. Or, in other words, they taught me most of what I know about programming.

His most important contribution to everyone else is The SNIPPETS Archive, which is a repository of extremely useful code snippets of almost anything you could think of.

The archive as well as Bob live at http://www.snippets.org.

Sadly, in recent days, he has passed the archive onto a group of volunteers. Hopefully it can be resurrected.

Bob Stout did not write the code, others wrote it.  Bob is an arrogant blowhard.
