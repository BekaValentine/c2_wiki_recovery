I did XP on a project in Sydney Australia which was a lot of fun and eXtremely successful!

I have done all kinds of software from GUI to Real-Time, including IDEs, compiler and runtime systems for dynamic languages, et cetera.  I like and believe in UserCenteredDesign which fits right into Agile/XP practices.

Recent "just for fun" projects include a Scheme->Smalltalk translator (including a complex number package) and some Squeak Smalltalk "GUI for ordinary folks" prototyping.  
I have been implementing Ward's FIT test system in Lisp and Scheme.

I am interested in making computers usable by ordinary folks!
