A set of ideas/concepts given to the author of any fantasy book, all of which must be used in the book. They include
	* The mysterious wizard (often old and bearded)
	* The broken weapon
	* The powerful but apparently insignificant artifact (ring, stone, whatever)
	* A major character must die (or appear to, but re-appear later)

Most of these appear in LordOfTheRings, but they were at least reasonably original there.

I think this was invented by DaveLangford, a SF critic and author. I first read it in White Dwarf, a UK gaming magazine, probably in 1980 or so
