Everyone says ExtremeProgramming is totally new. 
I say: It is not.

Maybe you have to change your point of view, but you don't need to change radically.

ExtremeProgramming is like the 'old' software-development-process. You have got analysis, design, programming, redesign, qualitymanagement, .. nothing new.

ExtremeProgramming just changed the doing. It 'industrialized' the process.
	* Analysis -> user stories.
	* Design programming and qualityManagement -> PairProgramming
	* QualityManagement -> PairProgramming

There is one big different. You don't have to write papers, to know, what the user wants, and you don't have to read papers to test your application and to test if you reached the goal. When there are automatic test, you do not need paper any more.

I would say: ExtremeProgrammingIsNotNew

''Not quite everyone says it's new. Beck says here on page xvii: "However, none of the ideas in XP are new. Most are as old as programming. There is a sense in which XP is conservative - all its techniques have been proven over decades ..."''

It's not new, but it is Extreme!

''It's not extreme, it's old-fashioned, anti-technology, anti-optimization, laid-back programming (40-hrs week). "Extreme" would be risky and not just well-done. You're selling business as usual as a new BuzzwordCompliant name. --ReiniUrban''
