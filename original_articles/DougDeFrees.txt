DougDeFrees is an I/T guy at the IBM Almaden Research Center. (This seems a little strange, writing about myself in the third person.) Doug came across Wiki in an experimental server that DavidChess set up (http://c2.com/cgi/wikibase?DavidChess) inside IBM, this led him to WikiWiki. Doug plans to poke around the WikiWiki for a while to learn more about this interesting collaboration tool. He sees potential applications both in his work life at IBM and his non-work volunteer work with Destination Imagination (http://www.destinationimagination.org).
