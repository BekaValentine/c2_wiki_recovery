See (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) for a full explanation.

ConfirmationBias is basically seeking evidence, granting greater weight to evidence, and better remembering evidence that supports whatever preconception or hypothesis we favor. This is a nearly universal blind spot in humans. Rationalists will make efforts to compensate for the bias. Related to the cherry picking fallacy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_%28fallacy%29) and WishfulThinking.

''Seeing and hearing only that information/proof which confirms one's own beliefs or ideas, to such an extent that obvious and plentiful contradictory information and facts are not even noticed or acknowledged to exist (one literally does not see them i.e. "has blinders on"; "tricks of the mind").''
