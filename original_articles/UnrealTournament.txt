Unreal tournament is often considered to be one of the best first person shooters of all time... Its major advantage (or disadvantage) is that it is not story based. 

''I had more fun playing UnrealTournament2004 than Halo 2 (which, uhm, comes out in a month . .). UT2K4 has better and more responsive vehicles '''and''' balances the vehicles perfectly with deathmatch style play (i.e. on foot). In short if you liked UT2K3, then UT2K4 loses nothing and adds an immense amount. I'm usually anti-spam, but I have no affiliation with Unreal and just love playing it - LayneThomas (CoderLlama on UT2K4).''
