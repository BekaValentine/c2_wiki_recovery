A WikiBadge invented for the purpose of appending a signed comment to make explicit the fact that the following are recognized:
* it may have been inappropriate to not sign my comment, therefore I signed it
* when it comes time to remove the comment, the gentle WikiZen may appreciate a green light
* it may not be necessary or appropriate to assimilate it, so OpenAuthor doesn't quite fit
* some folk (including me) like to keep a signature somewhere on the page just for its BackLink value and the possibility of wondering what has happened if I come back after a month or three, as mentioned in WikiSignature; but in this case I don't care

It might be best read as permission, perhaps sometimes an invitation, but not an imperative. You could instead just delete the WikiBadge, and perhaps the signature too.

'''On the name,'''

I avoid saying Delete''''''When''''''Implemented (in the context of a feature request) because I appreciate that ResolvedWontFix may be a valid response.

'''On the usage,'''

I suppose it is superfluous when applied to WikiMail, but some might feel that comments made should be left for fear of offending the sender? I don't know, maybe I'm just a bit touchy. 8-)

I realize we already have a drawer full of very similar tools for jobs like this, and the creation of another (with a slightly perverse name to boot) may not be necessary or welcome. Will the world perhaps suggest an alternative before consigning this page to the BitBucket?
