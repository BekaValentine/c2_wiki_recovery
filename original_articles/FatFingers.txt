People are said to have "fat fingers" when they type on keyboards unlike touch typists. 

Pointing the index finger at the keyboard (or the middle finger out straight) and shouting out eenie meenie miny moe is common.

FatFingers sometimes miss keys or double up on two keys by accident.

Some have slim long fingers. Sometimes we still use Fat Finger style typing to give my hands a break from the stressful touch typing positions and reaches (hit the keys with your elbows).
