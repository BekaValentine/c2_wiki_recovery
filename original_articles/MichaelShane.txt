My experience is in applying computer solutions to engineering problems. I've worked mainly with C, C++, Perl and, most recently, Python. I switched to Python because I could never do composite data structures (e.g., a list of dictionaries) in Perl without spending 15 minutes reading chapter 4 of the CamelBook. In Python, it just works.
