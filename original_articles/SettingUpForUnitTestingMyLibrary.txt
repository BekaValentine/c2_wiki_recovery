UnitTests for MyLibrary require essentially the same Perl and MySQL software components as are required for a normal install of MyLibrary except that installing the MyLibrary module and scripts is not necessary.  Tests for the subroutines can be placed in a subdirectory of that containing M''''''yLibrary.pm and use
 require "../M''''''yLibrary.pm";
instead of
 use M''''''yLibrary;
The PerlLanguage module PerlUnit Unit::Test (http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Unit/) provides a version of the xUnit TestingFramework that can be used with ProceduralCode as well as with ObjectOriented code.
