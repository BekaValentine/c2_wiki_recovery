In reference to AppleComputer'''''''s StockMarket downfall in October 2000.

As Wiki is a continual medium. Was it wise to post a current affair? Since it may quickly become outdated. Perhaps however we will be able to look back at this page in the future, and indeed other current affair pages like it. And see what the future held then.
