What are the various GUI models out there? 

* ModelViewController

* EventDriven (GUI engine mostly declarative from app developer's perspective, with optional events that can override or add behavior).

* ImmediateModeGui (contrast with retained mode) is a model frequently used in games.  It is also largely used in memory-constrained systems, where the memory overhead of declared object hierarchies is unacceptable (e.g., GEOS/64 allows for only 8 buttons, and text-only menus.  If you wish to exceed any of these limits, you necessarily need to resort to something very close to, if not actually ''using'', immediate-mode GUI management).
