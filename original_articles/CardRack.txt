 Suppose you have a bunch of 3 x 5 (inch) cards that you want to 
 organize on a wall or similar vertical surface....

 Get a large piece of strong paper-like material. Make alternate 
 valley and mountain folds across the paper.  Make the mountain 
 folds 1 inch below the valley folds; the valley folds 2 inches below 
 the mountain folds. When you have finished folding, the paper 
 should appear pleated. Bind the edges with tape.

 Fasten to the wall. Stick your cards in the pockets. 

 A large Federal Express envelope is a good source of material for a 
 small rack. If you want to do an entire wall, try Dupont Tyvek 
 House Wrap. Buy it at Home Depot. It's similar to the FedEx 
 envelope material.

 I haven't made a large rack like this but I do have a couple of small 
 ones. I also have a one pocket version taped to the top of my 
 monitor to hold cards for immediate work in progress.

''Sounds good for an office, but can it be adapted for portability and laptop use?''

If you use a scanner to create images of the cards and a scheme of organization as described above as that of a scan indexing and storage program , the screen of your laptop can hold as many cards as you like and can be organized, indexed, and archived for future use without requiring tape, cardboard, wall space or any other gizmos.

Another alternative is to get a can of 3M spray post-it glue. ($10 at Office Max). Get a couple of large foam-core boards and spray them. Index cards will then stick the them, and the boards are portable. --DaveSmith

Yet Another Alternative is to use a Magnetic Whiteboard (or a large sheet of ferrous metal) and magnets to hold them up.

Or a WhiteBoard and BluTack. You already have both of these in your office, so there is precisely zero setup cost (not counting erasing what was already on the whiteboard!). In the absence of a whiteboard, a gloss-painted wall, or anything similar, will do. -- TomAnderson

I prefer plain old rubber-cement - Just a little dab will do - ( and it is removable - from the wall, or the dab from the card - spray-can adhesives have undesirable side-effects )
