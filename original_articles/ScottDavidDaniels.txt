Hi, I am one of the old farts who learned young.
I am a currently a PythonLanguage fanatic -- Python has addressed most of the most horrible itches 
I've wanted to scratch in language design; I get to muck in close enough to the guts without feeling
like I have to.
If you want to email me (for anything but spam), send mail to Scott.Daniels@Acm.Org; I might even reply.
