The idea that a (certain kind of) computer in the future will run similarly to human cells... 70 percent water?

Electricity can travel through water based objects... low voltage too.

Low power consumption.

Lots of water available on Earth (a renewable resource).

And, can we find a way to grow computers?

Dune Mentats spring to mind, as do the slaves in VernorVinge's ''A Deepness in the Sky''.  Also, look up the etymology of the word "computer"; it used to be a profession.

Sean McMullin has 3 novels about a post-apocalyptic Australia where convicts are used in a huge adding machine-like computer.

There's also fluidics, building logic circuits from directed water flow.
