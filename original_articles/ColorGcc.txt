ColorGcc is a script which filters error messages to provide coloured message for GnuCee(C) or GnuCpp(C++ ) from the GnuCompilerCollection. See http://schlueters.de/colorgcc.html. It is a PerlLanguage script.

The same command (colorgcc) will work with both C and C++ but does not understand C++ linkage so is only useful for C++ when there is a compiler error.

It is included in some Linux distributions e.g. UbuntuLinux.
