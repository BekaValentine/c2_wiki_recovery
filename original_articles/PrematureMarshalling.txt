'''Problem:'''

Too much! Too much! Too much! Example:

''Coder'': My VisualBasic program is too big for one programmer. What shall I do?

''Alleged Guru'': VisualBasic makes binding components together very easy, my child. Simply cut your program in half, give one half of it to your colleague, and agree on an interface between the two halves.

'''Proposed fixes:'''
	* Chuck VisualBasic and get a Real Language.
	* Keep all the source under one Project file, and frequently check in your changes.

''This doesn't seem to be so much against "marshaling" as against unnecessary distribution.''

PrematureDistribution (meaning premature client/server) would be another good category in the series. Except I can't think of an AntiPattern for it.

But I'm trying for "premature ActiveX" or "premature orbs" or "premature component architectures" here. P''''''rematureComponentization?
