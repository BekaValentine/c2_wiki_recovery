Man, I screwed this up once, so I'm hoping this time I do it better.

First of all, this is CategoryHomePage. I'm interested in TeachingWithGames. I'm not a gamer, but I'm working on a school project where we use Age of Mythology in an English class. I believe this has been done on the university research level, but I'm trying to do it  on the secondary level. That said, all you middle-aged, career-changing individuals out there who find learning through the use of technology more exciting than the old top-down-I'm-filling-your-brains-with-knowledge model, talk to me. I can use all the help I can get.

Don't ban My Space and then not utilize its fascination for students. Silly.
