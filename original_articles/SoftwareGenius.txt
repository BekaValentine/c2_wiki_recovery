Who do you rate (and '''not''' rate) as one?

For example, I saw something rated BillGates as one. Unlikely, except perhaps in his younger days. ''I'm not so sure. That original Basic was a pretty cool piece of work''

Maybe either part of KernighanAndRitchie?

Can someone be ''just'' a software genius --- or do they some other insightful skill to be rated as such?

I tried for a long time to figure out if I was a SoftwareGenius or a SoftwareIdiot.  I finally figured out that I guess I'm JustaProgrammer.  -- JonGrover
