I am a project manager at ThoughtWorks.  A confirmed agnostic when it comes to anything that smacks of methodology, I have nevertheless enjoyed great success using Agile practices on the projects I have run at TW, particularly with such fabulous agile practitioners as RichardWatt, AlanFrancis, and OwenRogers
