I am a PhD student in dependable computing, working on the failure mode characterization of MiddleWare implementations. I work at the LAAS-CNRS, a research laboratory in Toulouse, France. See http://www.laas.fr/~emarsden/. 

I also enjoy programming, particularly in EmacsLisp and CommonLisp, and have written a few Emacs extensions and CL libraries that you can find on my personal home page, http://www.chez.com/emarsden/.
