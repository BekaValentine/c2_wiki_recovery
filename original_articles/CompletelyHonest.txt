An abstract concept that doesn't exist... all humans lie, anyone who says otherwise, is lying.

A rare, often politically dangerous ''(but sometimes very entertaining)'', condition in which one says only what is true.

Evidently this becomes scarcer the higher up in an organization one looks.

''Who was it that said "I have discovered the secret of deceiving diplomats.  I tell them the truth and they don't believe me."?  It made me a lot more comfortable with my PathologicalHonesty!''

When coupled with a personal sense of ethics that drives one to do only those things that contribute to one's greatest good, a very powerful attribute.

I sometimes get intimidated to lying, and I am being CompletelyHonest about it.
