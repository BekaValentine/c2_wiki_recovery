'''On DeleteOffTopic, just because it is OffTopic!!!'''

''Explanation and suggestion to '''new comers'''. Especially to those who got their enthusiasm squashed due to the GotDeleted attack.''

CommunityExpectations change over time. I have read in a separate page on WardsWiki, that made an excellent analogy of this place to a coffee shop. So if your contributions, or mine in this post, got deleted in part/whole by other parties, then it is ''''just karma'''.
* but if you back up your own edits on a PersonalWiki, you are helping yourself when fate does extend you a welcoming smile.

There are things you can do to increase the chances of WikiZen''''''s taking a TolerateOffTopic view:
* make sure you are a known personality here, as there are lots of one-off/short-term visitors who left material that nobody else care about.
** Set up a proper HomePage and use a UserName in your posts would help.
* Hopefully you are known for some collaboration in OnTopic pages.
* Very helpful if you are known for helping out other new comers who share similar general principles, it would be good.
* If you model your behavior after a WikiGnome, your GnomeFee may come in the form of extra tolerance for your own interests.
* If your OffTopic interests are not controversial (generate more heat than light), that would stand a better chance to being left alone.
* If you do post OffTopic material, please do a small test page first. Survival rate is much better if there are other people here with similar interests.

'''Tough gnoming work needed'''

* help reduce EditWars. Blessed are the peace makers. Just make sure you do not get dragged into one yourself. See LetHotPagesCool for some hints
* help reduce ThreadMess (very difficult but worthwhile if you have the skills and patience)
