A 1976 book by Peter Elbow, explaining how to write by alternating between freewriting (writing nonstop without editing) and editing.  Also discusses getting your ideas to "cook"--as raw ingredients combine and transform in the culinary process--to move further towards the finished product.  Highly recommended.
