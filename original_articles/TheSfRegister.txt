'''The SFR'''

The Bozo Bit (see SetTheBozoBit) is a crude indicator that doesn't take into account the mind numbing variety of idiots one may encounter in nature. Thus, we propose updating this anti-pattern from a single bit value to a larger structure called the SFR.

In the current standard, the SFR is 32-bits, thereby allowing nearly 4.3 billion types of idiot to be distinguished. It is not lost on this author that even this measure is potentially inadequate with global population near 6 billion, and that presently unindexable forms of idiocy may thus already exist in nature.

To avoid such gaps as well as unwelcome collisions, we propose extending the SFR to 128-bits, which should be amply expressive for any plausible future growth in either aggregate population or idiot density.

''Silly Fool Register, or something else?''  Stupid Fuck?

Why not just the BozoRegister?
