I'm interested in programming languages.  

I'm especially interested in simple, powerful languages like IoLanguage, IokeLanguage, LispLanguage, NuLanguage, SelfLanguage, SmalltalkLanguage, and related issues.  I'm also interested in historical languages I've used, including Algol68 (AlgolLanguage), IconLanguage, SnobolLanguage and PascalLanguage.

Background: I've had a few years as a programmer and Macintosh support person, and I'm now a philosopher.
