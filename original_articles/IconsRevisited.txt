Many months after WardCunningham kindly added the definition of ''iconoclasm'' in ExtremeIconoclasm (out of WebstersAmericanDictionary?) - as well as formatting the page, making it much more readable, and adding a typically balanced postscript (what a host Wiki has!) - I was browsing the OxfordEnglishDictionary (Concise version).  As one does in England. (It's so interesting over here.)

Suddenly and without warning, I came across icon (and indeed ikon), iconic, iconoclasm, iconoclast, iconography and even iconology. I thrilled as the words I read rekindled and strengthened the many analogical possibilities that had sprung to mind once before, long before ...

When I have a moment I just may put a few of those definitions right here. I genuinely believe there are some excellent directions we didn't take in our previous discussion of the icon analogy.
