It seems some of the WikiGnome''''''s have a rather limited sense of what is important when they post something like "it's UgLy", or some other such comment. It doesn't add much to the page, and it doesn't add anything constructive.

So two pages can cover the problem as some see problems. This page, and another one call StopTryingToUseAcronymsAsLinks.

Then we can be done with the topic and move on to more constructive postings. 

Or perhaps you can understand that AcronymsAreConcise.
