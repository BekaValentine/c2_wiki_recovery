RA specializes in the epic sagas of primitive folks. His most popular work reveals the Exodus of a group of pilgrims who flee their ancestral home after receiving a vision of its destruction. They endure the rigors of crossing a land remade by humans, seeking a new home in a safe place. Along this road they lose their innocence encountering the horrors of lapine capitalism, and of lapine communism. But they win thru by learning from their experiences & reusing these in new combinations, and by forging mutually beneficial alliances with other creatures along their way.

RA also performs the Tolkienian feat of introducing a language along the way, so well that towards the end we understand what the curse ''silflay hraka o embleer rah'' means without even realizing it.
