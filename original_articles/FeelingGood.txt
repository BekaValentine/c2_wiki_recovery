There are many caring WikiZens (only people who care retain Wiki''''''Zenship).  Another vote of thanks to KrisJohnson and FrancisHwang.

FeelingGood! The opposite of the need for CynicalRelease. Do you get a little upset at the universe when you feel down, but know things go in cycles? Well enjoy this time as much
as you despise the bad times. Feel good!
