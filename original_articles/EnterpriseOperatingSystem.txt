From UnixHasMoreFunctionalityThanWindowsMyth: '''GUI is essential on an EnterpriseOperatingSystem IMHO.'''

I would love to disagree with this, but what is an Enterprise OS?
Possible answers:
* An OS that runs server applications such as databases, web servers, e-mail servers, the like.
* An OS that is used on the USS Enterprise. In that case, it must be agreed that the GUI is essential.
