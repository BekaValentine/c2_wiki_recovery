Dave optimizes LinearProgramming codes.  

When I was first programming in Smalltalk I mentioned
to Dave that I was now writing the equivalent of pages
of FORTRAN in a couple of lines.  He was doing the 
opposite:  writing pages and pages for the equivalent 
of a couple of lines
of FORTRAN.
Dave was coding for the Cray XMP, the fastest computer
in the world.  The patterns he used were not unlike
those used by the best SmalltalkImplementers.

Dave taught me to program in CompassAssembler for the 
CDC-6000.  His son, DonDodson, has offered his own
improvements to Dave's LinearShuffle.
