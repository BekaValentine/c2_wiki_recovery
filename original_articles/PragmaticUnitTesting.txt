One of the books in ThePragmaticStarterKit series, covering unit testing in Java. While the examples are Java-specific, most of the advice is not specific to any particular language.

After reading ThePragmaticProgrammer and PragmaticVersionControl, I was looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, our team uses CeePlusPlus and CVS, so unit testing with Java is only helpful in a very abstract sense. I would love to read (the non-existent)"Pragmatic Unit Testing in C++ with CppUnit" or something similar. -- LayneThomas
