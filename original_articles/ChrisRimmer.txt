I work for Nominet UK, the .uk Internet Registry.  

I am interested in agile development and how to apply its techniques in database-based application development. I got interested in this stuff through contributing to utPLSQL (listed on the Wiki as PlSqlUnit), the open source unit testing framework for PL/SQL. (See http://utplsql.sourceforge.net.)
