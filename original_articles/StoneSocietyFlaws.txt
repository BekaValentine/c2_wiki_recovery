StoneSociety is an interesting idea but it swept a lot of stuff under the carpet. In particular:

* How do you intelligently evaluate one option of one auction against all the other options of all the other auctions?
* How do you prevent monkey business - spam and so on - from appearing as options of auctions?
* How do you stop people bidding politically - ie. to disenfranchise minorities and so on?
* How do you prevent the prevalent value system - money - from dominating stone interactions?

Stones was only intended to work on a small scale ... but without answers to the above I don't think it's a complete solution, which I guess is why I haven't fielded a working system for it or even a representative set of functional tests. It remains, at best, a work in progress. --PeterMerel
