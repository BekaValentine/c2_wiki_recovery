A place to write descriptions of interesting sets of Wiki pages.

----

'''The set of all Wiki pages that are self-describing.'''

An example is ThreadMode.

Oddly, it is impossible for OrphanPage''''''s to be cited as an example of this set. It could be an example, but it would stop being one if I told you about it by linking to it. ''Unless you 'cite' Dead''''''Pages like that.'' Wow. You''''''Learn''''''Something''''''New''''''Every''''''Day.

Any others?

ThePageThatListsAllWikiPagesThatDontLinkToThemselves gives us a nice paradox.

''Not really, there isn't any particular reason why it couldn't maintain a link to itself in addition to the list.  Also, the title of the page itself could be included as the first item in the list :)''
