''You can find your stuff if you simply put Everything in One Folder '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140819

Ridiculous as it might seem, this is now being contemplated in a sense by '''The Cloud'''. But here I am suggesting an '''alternate''' method of storing and accessing your '''Important Stuff''' in your own, private, controllable space. 

You can access it anytime if you follow some PrinciplesOfNaming for your stuff.

You find stuff by simply remembering part of its name and searching for files with that name in its name. Its as simple as that!

The technique is not limited to EverythingInOneFolder, but also to EverythingInOnePlace.
