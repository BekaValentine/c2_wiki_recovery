ArcLanguage is a new dialect of LISP being designed by PaulGraham. It is not specifically intended to be a ''popular'' language for development in competition with CeeLanguage and JavaLanguage, but a language for hackers. (See BeingPopularEssay) As a successor to both CommonLisp and SchemeLanguage, it is intended to correct most if not all of the perceived flaws of both, and is meant particularly to be a small, kernel-based language which can be easily used for CasualProgramming.
