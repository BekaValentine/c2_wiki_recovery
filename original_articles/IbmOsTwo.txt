In the mid 80s, InternationalBusinessMachines developed their own operating system for their PS/2 line of PersonalComputer''''''s. OS/2 was developed as a better-designed alternative to MsDos and the early MicrosoftWindows operating systems.

OS/2 was later rebranded as '''OS/2 Warp'''.

OS/2 didn't meet with much commercial success. Microsoft competed with their Windows products on the consumer front and LinuxOs flourished on the technical front. IBM discontinued support for OS/2 at the end of 2006.
