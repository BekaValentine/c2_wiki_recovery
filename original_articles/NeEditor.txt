(ne stands for "Nice Editor")

Does anyone else use it? It's a small 'vi replacement' editor but it uses normal keybindings (Ctrl-O = Open,Ctrl-Q = Quit etc). Here's the feature list from its home page http://ne.dsi.unimi.it/

*compiles without effort everywhere (or almost everywhere), is packaged for all Linux distributions, and ported to other operating systems (such as Mac OS X);
*is fast, small, powerful and simple to use;
*has standard keystrokes (e.g., copy is CTRL-C);
*uses little bandwidth, so it is ideal for email, editing through phone line (or slow GSM/GPRS/UMTS) connections;
*has a very compact internal text representation, so you can easily load and modify very large files…
*three user interfaces: control keystrokes, command line, and menus; keystrokes and menus are completely configurable;
*syntax highlighting;
*full support for UTF-8 files, including multiple-column characters;
*the number of documents and clips, the dimensions of the display, and the file/line lengths are limited only by the integer size of the machine;
*simple scripting language where scripts can be generated via an idiotproof record/play method;
*unlimited undo/redo capability (can be disabled with a command);
*automatic preferences system based on the extension of the file name being edited;
*automatic completion of prefixes using words in your documents as dictionary;
*a file requester with completion features for easy file retrieval;
*extended regular expression search and replace a la emacs and vi;
*a very compact memory model—you can easily load and modify very large files;
*editing of binary files.
