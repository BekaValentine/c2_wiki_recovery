It's light and simple and probably has the best UI of any Smalltalk I've ever seen simply because it's light and simple. I don't like method categories. Of course, it's a Win16 executable and the company (OSI) is defunct, and the environment tends to crash, and it's ugly, but it's still my favourite Smalltalk. I wrote a haiku about the RedScreenOfDeath. -- SunirShah
