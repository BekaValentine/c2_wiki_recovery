A general term for the place where useless bits go.

UnixOs BitBucket:
 /dev/null
Modern Unix variants grind up the bits and recycle them through:
 /dev/random
To ensure a plentiful supply of RandomNumbers, one should keep one's BitBucket full by regularly tossing old documents into DevNull.

Also used to refer something (an object, file, etc) as raw data (a sequence of bits/bytes), rather than as a structured (and usually opaque) entity.

----

It also a a web-based hosting service for projects that use the MercurialVersionControl system: http://bitbucket.org/ ''It now also offers GitVersionControl. It differs from GitHub in allowing free private repositories.''
