I'm a technical consultant specialising in policy based network management and IP service activation, including QoS, MPLS VPNs and security issues, working for MetaSolv (http://www.metasolv.com), which acquired Orchestream in Jan 2003.

My main Wiki interest is in how to use it for intranet-based knowledge management.  I've recently set up a TWiki clone as part of this effort (http://twiki.org/).  My own site is at http://donkin.org/.
