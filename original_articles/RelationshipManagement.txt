'''"No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem." -- GeraldWeinbergQuotes '''

RelationshipManagement competencies have always been a required skill for people involved in ProjectManagement. And in this age of OutSourcing, the awareness and sensitivities are being expected of other IT staff as well.

In "The New Competencies in IT" , at http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=4525&t=technology, a CIO was quoted as saying "You need staff who can deal with relationships and create the right network of contacts..". IS staff , at all levels, need competencies that allow them to bridge business and technology.

Elsewhere in the paper it was stated "roles crucial to the new IS focus much more on business and behavioral skills. EmotionalIntelligence is the '''behavioral skill''' that is sought after as much as business knowledge (what makes the organisation tick) and skills (ability to lead innovation).

And yes, '''technical skills''' are needed. The article said "they have become a base".
