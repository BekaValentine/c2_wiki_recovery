BrianSmith was already taken, so I figured I would become the second.

I'm (as of the time I'm writing this) a systems administrator and assistant lead programmer for my department at the University of Washington, and an undergraduate majoring in history with minors in music and Latin.

I'm really not all that interesting. Sorry.
