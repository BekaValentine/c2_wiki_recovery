Object Identifiers (OIDs) are unique identifying codes allocated in a hierarchical manner. There are currently millions. The entire Internet has an OID of 1.3.6.1; all Internet resources with OIDs are subsidiary to this. The IETF's RFC 3001 (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3001.txt) proposed a "urn:" namespace for OIDs, which has yet to be implemented.

Registries of known OIDs:

ObjectIndentifiers are commonly associated with SimpleNetworkManagementProtocol (SNMP).  Are they used outside the scope of SNMP?
