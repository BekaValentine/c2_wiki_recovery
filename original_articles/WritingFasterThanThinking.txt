Usually caused by a ConditionedResponse, the author of such remarks has not really thought (his) response through.  It is not uncommon for such remarks to include a logical inconsistency, or at least a statement embarrassing to the author. Consider the following example from LecturingToIdiots:
	 :	More likely the lecturer is an intolerant blowhard who accepts no ideas but his own. 
	 :	People are diverse. Get used to it. 

Lecturer in the given context means any person attempting to pass information via words - i.e. the vast majority of people. 
The following is based on (his) "logic":
if A is the author of the remark,
since A is a lecturer, A is most likely an intolerant blowhard who accepts no ideas but his own.
This seems to be demonstrated by his last sentence - "Get used to it."

	 :	It seems unlikely that the author would purposely denigrate himself.
Note that the mantra "People are diverse." seems to fly in the face of the first sentence as well.

Upon discovery that one is WritingFasterThanThinking, it is best to recant immediately and make apologies quickly.

It would seem lecturer is too broad a term for variable A above. LecturingToIdiots denotes a specific variety of lecturer - which specifically was the object of the assertion found in the WritingFasterThanThinking in question.
