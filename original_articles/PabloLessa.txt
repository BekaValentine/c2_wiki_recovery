Hello.
I'm 20 years old, born and living in Montevideo, Uruguay.
I just discovered this wiki thing, and think it's very cool.
My main interests are math and music (not together, please).
I hope to contribute to the CategoryProblemSolvingStrategy related pages.

The second time I connect to my new wiki page, I find the above commentary added.  Cool!!

So I went and checked on the math quiz and I can say two things.  First of all it looks really hard.  Second I think the first two problems can be attacked by brute force with the help of a suitable computer program.  I intend to make this program in python.
