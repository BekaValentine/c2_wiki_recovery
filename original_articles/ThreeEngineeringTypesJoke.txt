Three engineering types -- an electronics hardware engineer, a software engineer, and an engineering manager -- were attending a conference out of town. On the morning of the conference they were in a rental car on the highway to the conference center when the car had a flat tire. Being prepared for all exigencies the manager had forwarded his cell phone coverage. He was prepared to delegate the work to the appropriate labor force, so he said, "I'll just call for a tow truck to come out here and get us going again."

The hardware engineer objected, saying, "Wait a minute, boss. We have everything we need right here in house to solve this problem. Here's a jack, here's a spare tire, and we even have available labor. We don't need any outside consultants to help us out at all!"

The software engineer jumped in with his own objection: "Wait, wait, you guys! Aren't we getting a little worked up over potentially nothing? How about if we just shut the car off, turn it back on, and see if the tire fixes itself?"
