ThreadSafe LanguageDiscussion

''Donald - why are you putting "CategoryProgrammingLanguage" on pages that are not about programming languages?  For example, "ThreadSafeLanguage" is not a language.  I believe this categorisation is misleading and unhelpful.''

I categorized "ThreadSafeLanguage" because it has on the first line the following:
 
'''''A ThreadSafe language''' is one in which two activations of a method simply cannot run simultaneously within the same object.'' 

It is about a language, if not a specific language, one which shows certain characteristics. To me that is helpful, and not misleading. It mentions ErlangLanguage, but it would be more helpful if other languages were mentioned so that the reader would know what particular languages are  '''ThreadSafe'''.

CategoryProgrammingLanguage has a section about types of programming languages so i agree that this categorization is ok.
