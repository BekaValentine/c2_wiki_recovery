Win32's answer to the main() function in all CeeLanguage and CeePlusPlus programs.  (Actually, WinMain() is called from the entry point of a Win32 program, or from a function called from the entry point, which may end up being main().)  The "canonical" form of WinMain() is to:
	* Create the application's main window
	* Display it
	* Enter a loop which waits for UI events, then dispatches them, typically to the main window's WndProc()
	* Exits the loop when a special UI message is received (WM_QUIT)
	* Performs cleanup and exits
All the monstrous muck that is MFC, WTL, etc. (and formerly other stuff like DDE, which led to OLE, COM, etc.) rests on this simple little ditty.
