Just a thought.....

The patterns are always replicating themselves onto higher levels.
We are compelled by time itself to use the Wiki.
Perhaps a network is the next evolutionary step up from a hierarchy?

I only just discovered Wiki a day ago.
How quickly is it growing?
Do you think it will grow exponentially?

''It's more like a natural growth curve (also called an s-curve), which looks exponential at the beginning an then hits an inflection point and starts to taper off as it reaches saturation. Here, we are limited by the number of people interested in the stuff that's OnTopic, as well as the finiteness of what is OnTopic. Right now, I don't think we've hit the inflection point yet, so we are close to exponential. But I must say, our growth factor isn't very large (i.e. it is close to, but greater than 1). Of course, this is all speculation, and Ward probably has some data to show the actual growth curve. Or maybe some WikiZen can point it out for me, as I forget where I might have seen it.''

Actually, the beauty of the Net is that it still is really young (Jan 2004) with the mass still learning more and more every day. I'd say I'm an avid internet user and have been since I first found it in my college days in '95, but only this past year found out about Wiki, and only last week started my own Wiki. --BryceNielsen
