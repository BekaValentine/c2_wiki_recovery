One of the FallaciousArgument''''''s wherein a) some desirable end result '''E''' is identified; b) some particular means '''M''' is identified, along with a claim that '''M -> E'''; c) therefore '''M''' is advocated as an end in itself--without giving much further consideration (beyond lip service) to '''E'''.

This is a fallacy because:

* '''M -> E''' may not be true (or only true under certain circumstances) 
* '''M''' might have other undesirable ends which counteract its promition of '''E'''.
* There may be other means besides '''M''' to achieve '''E''', which may or may not be better.

Often times (not always), the advocate of '''M''' has other motives (ulterior or otherwise) for his support of '''M''', and may actively campaign against other means which might lead to '''E'''.  This could be something simple as a personal preference for '''M''', or a financial (or other) interest in '''M''', or he may otherwise be identified with '''M'''.  Other times, someone just decides that '''M->E''' means '''M''' is good, and forgets about '''E'''.
