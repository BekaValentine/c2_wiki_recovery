SomeoneElsesExample is an AntiPattern where the developer constructs a system from bits of examples from the web or from other programs. The developer does not take the time to learn all the caveats of the examples and does not take into consideration subtle effects of their combination.

Seen often when code is requested to be done as soon as possible, or from a LazyProgrammer. Very often, university students, or recent grads with little real world experience, use this AntiPattern, since they tend to approach real world problems as they would homework assignments.

The incentives to take a longer-term view are often not there. See SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.
