Paul Mc''''''Kenney is interested in improving performance of
programs and systems.  Such performance improvements can
be described by ParalleliZation, CodeLocking, DataOwnership,
ParTition, CriticalSectionFusing, and ReaderWriterLocking
patterns, among many others.

Several of these patterns are expanded on in a number of places, including:

* Selecting Locking Designs for Parallel Programs -- in Pattern Languages of Program Design Volume II, revision available at http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/paper/mutexdesignpat.pdf
* Selecting Locking Primitives for Parallel Programs -- in October 1996 CACM, revision available at http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/paper/mutexprimpat.pdf
* RCU-related patterns in Chapters 5 and 6 of 2004 dissertation at http://www.rdrop.com/users/paulmck/RCU/RCUdissertation.2004.07.14e1.pdf
