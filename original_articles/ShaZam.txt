In the 30s and 40s, there existed a superhero called CaptainMarvel.

''Captain Marvel is the alter ego of Billy Batson, a youth who works as a radio news reporter and was chosen to be a champion of good by the wizard Shazam. Whenever Billy speaks the wizard's name, he is instantly struck by a magic lightning bolt that transforms him into an adult superhero empowered with the abilities of six legendary figures.''

It is a GoodThing, this idea that a MagicLightningBolt can transform the nearly powerless into those who have powers and the ability to use it. 

I remembered this character when, in the page ''WikiDreamWorld'', I used the term '''marvelous'''. Mainly, it was because of the word Shazam, which when Billy used it, and the occasion demanded it, made power become available to do good things.

In the case of communications and computing, the power is there. Daily new hardware, software and techniques and communities are made available for the work to begin. We need but to begin to do what we can. Not by incantation or wizardry, but by awareness, informing ourselves, and utilizing what is becoming available to us in the best possible way!
