I am an American programmer for a software company called Blackbaud, who uses Visual Studio (mostly VB.NET these days) and SQL Server.

In a former life I worked for Nucor Steel, where I used Delphi to write client-server Win32 apps that ran on an Oracle back-end.

I may also be found in a few other places:
On StackOverflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/users/672/josephstyons and here: http://careers.stackoverflow.com/josephstyons

On a company hosted development forum here: http://www.bbdevnetwork.com/author/josephstyons/

I also took some pictures which are mildly interesting near the place I used to live:  http://www.panoramio.com/user/3219965

''Nice to meet you.''

Nice to meet you, too.  Some more about myself, in the hopes of generating some conversation here:
I still have a lot to learn as a programmer (graduated college in 2001), but so far my main interest- and maybe this is mostly an aesthetic thing- is in making software as user-friendly and feature-filled as possible without introducing visual clutter.  For this reason, Firefox has become one of my favorite programs.  I especially like features that are invisible but still intuitive (who doesn't, right?).  As a trivial example, the use of the Backspace key to go back in a browser, or F5 to refresh a screen.  MouseGestures are great, IMO.

What type of work do you do in your company?

Basically we have a large in-house suite of software that serves the non-profit industry.  I write customizations to that software.
