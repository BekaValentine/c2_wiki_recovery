John Williamson is currently Business Development Coordinator or some such title as he seems fit at City Netgates, Bristol, UK, using UML to model our ISP business processes to integrate a billing solution somehow....

Netgates is on the web at http://www.netgates.co.uk

See also my community project site at http://www.zyworld.com/fish1

Or email me on mailto:jpw@netgates.co.uk

Oh yes, anyone know of any useful ISP/ASP billing related patterns? Do email me rather than scribble here - I may never be back!! (But there again, its such a great place to hang with all those lovey cooldoods!
