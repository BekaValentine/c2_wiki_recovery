java.rmi.RemoteException:
* http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/rmi/RemoteException.html

"A RemoteException is the common superclass for a number of communication-related exceptions that may occur during the execution of a remote method call. Each method of a remote interface, an interface that extends java.rmi.Remote, must list RemoteException in its throws clause."
* That is, RemoteException is the way that failures of remote method calls can fail, and so a remote interface must declare RemoteException on all of its methods.

* References are often made to this page accidentally, in the act of writing out Java code. This problem, in which ClassNamesBecomeWikiNames, is rather common.

See edit text to learn what way you can write genuine Java''''''Code.  Remote''''''Exception instead of RemoteException (bold ''''''nothing)
This is a "SixSingleQuotes" Trick.
