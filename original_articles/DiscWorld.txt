The DiscWorld series of books by TerryPratchett are incredibly funny, well worth reading, fantastic, fun page turners; you wish they would never end!

As a bit of a background, the setting is a large disc that sits on the backs of four great elephants (The Fifth Elephant had a nasty accident), these in turn stand on the back of a turtle.

As well as some magic and fun fantasy, it explores some rather unique physics that makes this series attractive to your average ScienceFiction reader.

It's also attractive to anyone that likes a bit of light-hearted social commentary with their humor.
