'''General Notes'''

''Adding Attributes''

''Please use the same attributes and the same sequence of attributes in each review. If you add an attribute to one review, please consider adding it at the same location in each review, the WikiEngineReviewTemplate and the WikiEngineReviewTemplateAnnotated.''

''Reviews of New Releases''

''Please maintain separate reviews for each version of each WikiEngine. The intent is to maintain reviews of old versions of software that might still be in use on a WikiFarm or on a specific WikiSite. See WikiEngineReviewNewRelease for the recommended approach.''

----
'''General'''

	* ''Date of Review:'' December 7, 2000

	* ''WikiEngine and Version Reviewed:'' Twiky, unknown version 

	* ''WikiEngine Author:'' Sabu Francis (Tangent Software Pvt. Ltd.)

	* ''Review Summary:'' Twiky is more of a WikiFarm which happens to run their own WikiEngine. The WikiEngine is rather young, and it sounds like they plan to continue to develop it. At this point in time it is not very interesting to me because it is missing too many features that I believe are required. In particular navigation seems harder than many wikis because there is no place to easily type in a WikiName to jump to that page.

	 :	I could list the reasons that Twiky does not appeal to me, but they are covered in this review. The fact that it needs Windows (NT) to host my own wiki is not interesting -- I started this quest to find a replacement for AskSam so I could migrate to Linux.

	* ''Review Quality:'' Adequate for my purposes at this time.

	* ''Standard Features Missing (see WikiEngineReviewStandardFeatures):''

----
'''Software'''

	* ''Server OS:'' Windows NT, only

	* ''Standard Features Missing (see WikiEngineReviewStandardFeatures):'' No recent changes. Backlinks are a little harder to find because you can't get them by clicking on the page title or an explicit button.

----
'''WikiFarms'''

	* ''Name / cost / limits / URL / backup schedule / comments:''

	 :	Narasimha / free for a limited time, they prefer you pay a max of $25 -- if their costs exceed that they will help you migrate to your own NT Server / ? / http://narasimha.tangentially.com/agree.html / backup once/week
