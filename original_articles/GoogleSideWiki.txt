For something so blindingly worthless, it's not surprising that it's being shut down.  See http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html

In Google's own words:

"Sidewiki: Over the past few years, we’ve seen extraordinary innovation in terms of making the web collaborative. So we’ve decided to discontinue Sidewiki and focus instead on our broader social initiatives. Sidewiki authors will be given more details about this closure in the weeks ahead, and they’ll have a number of months to download their content."
