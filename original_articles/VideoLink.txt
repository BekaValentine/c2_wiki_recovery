How to do VideoLink''''''s in this wiki.
----

* Write the direct link to the video, no redirects http://www.youtube.com/''''''watch?v=-dnL00TdmLY
* Do not include secure connection like https, only http (without the s), just strip the 's'.
* Add the original descriptional titel of that video, as is on the original video website, even if it is a badly designed title
* Add additional information about that video if required or desired.
* Best if You can supply an alternative links because links get outdated all too easily, and sites like YouTube often put restrictions on videos like "this content not available in your country". So, if You think, the video You liked to show has value for more than a month, make it easy for later "generations" to find it in other places.

Here is a nice little video about the advantages of Wiki over e-Mail for organizing group activities:

'''Advantage of embedding:''' A YouTube video shown embedded in this wiki takes less PC-resources than on YouTube.
----
'''Different sources'''
* Links to YouTube videos are translated to imbed codes. The video will show as a key frame with a play button in the center.
* Links to .webm can not be embeded. Example: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/The_Impact_Of_Wikipedia.webm --ManorainjanHolzapfel 10/2014
