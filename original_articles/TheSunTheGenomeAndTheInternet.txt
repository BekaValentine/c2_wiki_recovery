FreemanDyson describes three technologies that he sees as having a large effect on the future of humanity:
* Cheap solar energy
* Advanced bio-engineering
* Pervasive Internet access

As usual, Dyson's concerns for social justice play a prominent role in the book. He views technology as a means to better distribute the spoils of our effort across the globe. Thus, he sees cheap solar energy as a great way to provide energy to the millions of villages that don't have electricity, bio-engineering as a way to increase food and fuel yields to provide for them, and the Internet as a great disseminator of information. He's equally concerned about a Gattaca-style dystopia where biotech leads to a caste system of superior bio-engineered humans on top and legions of normal proles on the bottom.
