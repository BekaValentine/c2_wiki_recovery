WirelessSecurity is a page on security concerns for WirelessDevices. Generally speaking, security concerns that apply to NetworkSecurity are relevant, and in addition, system implementators need to be conscious of additional challenges inherent in various wireless (radio or satellite based) methods.

** It is said FireWall and IT shop installed AV, VPN combination insufficient to protect against bogus hotspots. Recommend to use 802.1x scheme to overcome lack of inspection of wireless headers of existing tools.

WirelessSecurity is still far from practical. Someone in Germany demonstrated recently he can duplicate all the information in an electronic passport. Until InformationTheft can be reliably detected in a timely manner, I am pessimistic about its use in security sensitive applications.
