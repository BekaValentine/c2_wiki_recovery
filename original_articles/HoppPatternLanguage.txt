Is HalfObjectPlusProtocol a pattern language
instead of a simple pattern?
We seem to find other patterns that
compose into HOPP:

	* RemoteProxy
	* RemoteProcedureCall
	* SymmetricalReference

And there are patterns that refine HOPP:

	* SplitTreeFromLeaves
	* RelationshipObject

Consider the following pattern language for HOPP:

	* LocalConceptPresence
	* AutonomousCopy
	* SymmetricalReference
	* RemoteProcedureCall
	* SplitTreeFromLeaves
