Many times, over and over again, and on several pages, there is substantial discussion about OnTopic, OffTopic, WalledGarden''''''s, WikiSquatting, deletions and all.

As discussed on those pages, many wikizens tolerate pages that are clearly OffTopic but which seem to be of interest to a significant proportion (although not necessarily a majority) of other wikizens. For example, programmers in general, especially those interested in understanding programming languages and how we write in them, are often interested in languages more generally. Hence there are pages on linguistics and, more specifically, on particular languages, both "natural" and "constructed."  Programmers are also frequently interested in technology and the ways it might be used. Hence there are pages on StarTrek and others.

An OffTopic page can contain material of interest to a wider audience, and may be an invitation to learn, understand and potentially contribute. Such a page is a part of what makes this wiki a real community, rather than just a dry source of information, stands in stark contrast to a page or set of pages that someone sets up for their own private use, separated from the greater community.
