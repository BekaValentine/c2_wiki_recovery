Groove.Net at http://www.groove.net is the new company by RayOzzie. Its first
product is Groove, a PeerToPeer collaborative environment that is built on a XML transaction engine that can distribute changed content to connected, and occasionally connected participants.

It's WikiLike in nature, because it basically allows everybody to create a space, to invite people into that space and everybody in a space to edit the contents. 

A space is made up of a number of GrooveTools (like FileLibrary, Discussion, PictureAlbum, WebBrowser, Outliner and more)

Tools can be created by hacking some XML, HTML and JavaScript (if the tool uses the basic functionality that Groove supports) or with Java, C++ etc. that support COM. Groove fully supports the ModelViewController way of doing things.

I have used the Preview Edition of GrooveNet for several weeks now. It's great! What do others think about it? Is there any alternative which provides the same ease of use?

My dream would be to have a WikiClone right inside of GrooveNet as a GrooveTool. -- FrankGerhardt

As people start working in a virtual sense (as opposed to physically being there) then collaborative tools that people want are:
	* shared calendar
	* project/tasks management
	* file repository (much better than flinging attachments to and fro)
	* threaded discussions
	* IM - instant messaging
	* shared notes and chat
	* document review
	* contact management
	* non-adversarial writing (e.g. wiki)
	* workflow

The options that we have to work in this way are:
	* Paid and free hosted based VirtualOffice application services. Are they still there?
	* GrooveNet
	* WindowsTerminalServices or CitrixMetaframe
	* Remote Control like PcAnywhere or LapLink

As this page is about Groove, it would be good to produce some GrooveFaq for evaluators / users - the WikiWay.

GrooveNet got a mention on TheRegister (http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/29712.html) about its role in the USA's newest and most subversive surveillance infrastructure, TotalInformationAwareness.  It's based on a story from the NY Times (http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/business/11PRIV.html) -- FrancisLiu
