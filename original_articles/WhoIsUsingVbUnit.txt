'''''Who is using VbUnit?'''''
* BodoMaass, of course -- enough to write "VbUnit 3."

* AndyMorris -- Using it myself at work, trying to get other people in my team and other teams test infected. Finaly got a site license for VBUnit3. Find it saves me time in the end and results in much more robust code. 

* JohnMaxwell ''(from EnhancingVbUnitForEventProcessing)''

* ThomasEyde -- Using my own version, telling everybody how useful and timesaving it is. Nobody understands what I am talking about, but I know this is power!

* RobWilliams -- while helping a fellow consultant on his project.  I implemented several sort algorithms, then used VbUnit to test them for correctness and performance.  I have switched to Java, and have begun using JUnit (known here as JavaUnit).

* BruceOnder & CurtPeterson -- We're using it to test components and applications we write for our clients.  Haven't done any mods yet, but we have written two sister unit test frameworks, VBSUnit (for testing class-based ASP code) and vfp7unit (for testing Visual Foxpro 7.0 code).  Looking forward to VBUnit3!

* PatCallahan -- Just starting the tutorial using VBUnit3

* JohnnyHall -- We've used (and modified) vbUnit2 for our own internal development testing.  Looking to move to vbUnit3 v. soon.  Very impressed with it so far.  We'll integrate it into our automated build tools for regression testing.  Then we'll start to think about AcceptanceTest''''''ing.

* TobinHarris -- I've just started using VBUnit3 whilst developing the domain logic for a small application. Integrating it into my development process was a little tricky and required some patience, but I think I'm now hooked! I must say, it's incredible to see how many mistakes you can make. It's great when a test case you wrote 2 days ago fails through some minor tweaks in code. I imagine I'm saving quite a lot of time by having having my tests there. I've also done 2 refactoring sessions and I can now see why using this sort of testing process is fundamental to refactoring. Just a comment about how I'm not ashamed to admit I use VB: Yes, I'd wish VB was more like Java, but since I discovered that favouring aggregation over inheritance is a winner, VB seems much more freindly!

* JeffGrigg:
** Object persistence framework based on the DesigningSolutionsWithComPlusTechnologies book in mid-2001.  (vbUnit2)
** A fat client and some NT services (see RefactoringWithDesawareNtServiceToolkit).  VbUnitThree.  Tried (unsuccessfully) to get the technical lead TestInfected.  (...or at least wean ourselves of some bad CopyAndPasteProgramming habits.  ;-)
** SOAP web service -- ASP, COM+, IIS.  (Pushed almost all code into VB, so that not much ASP/VB testing was needed.)
** ''[Left ship.  Now doing Java.]''

* AaronHumphrey:  Just am starting to use it and still trying to figure out how it works with VisualSourceSafe.

* WillemBogaerts:  Nope. I tried to install a few VBUnit versions, and none of them worked. This was a while ago. Instead, I developed my own unit testing system and I am quite happy with it. As my system only consists of some classes, it works perfectly with SourceSafe. If I check in or share a class, I do this with the unit test also. I use a separate project file (without the unit tests) for the release of the application.

* BretPettichord: I have a client who's asked me to review their test-harness in VB for COM objects. I'm using VBUnit as a source of ideas for improvements.

* MattRyall: Started as of November 2004. Sadly, there are still teams writing code in VbClassic.

* SteveCulshaw: Even now we've got a lot of VBClassic, and I'd like to put better unit testing around it, so started looking at vbUnit

Refreshing to see so many people not ashamed to admit they use VB.

I am not ashamed to admit it, but I am ashamed that I used it.  If not for its prominence in the market and the dictates of my clients, I would never have touched VisualBasic beyond my initial evaluation of its unsuitability as a development language.
