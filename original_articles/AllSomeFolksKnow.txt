If all you have is a hammer then everything tends to look like a nail [AllProblemsLookLikeNails].  For example, VisualProgramming.  

When interviewing programming candidates with self-said "experience", ask them to cut some code in any text editor. Just a simple task, like sort this array, or parse an arbitrary sentence for, say, tokens that end in "d".  

It turns out that all of what many folks know ain't much.  But VisualProgramming is here to stay and you are permitted to give thanks for pre-dating it.  You may be able to parlay the knowledge of creating code into income well into your old age if you need to.
