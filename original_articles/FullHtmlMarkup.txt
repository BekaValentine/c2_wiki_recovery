A WikiEngine that allows users to use the richness of HTML markup, instead of a metalanguage ''(Isn't 'pidgin' more appropriate?)''. 

I think that this is the SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork for many people, because I find it difficult to remember the syntax of each wiki that I come across.

I think it would be a good idea to have a simple form of MarkUp for beginners or users in a hurry though - something as minimal as adding paragraph and line breaks. In fact, this is the next feature that I'll implement in my wiki.

''How about BBcode? It's the markup used in a lot of message boards.'' AnswerMe

Is there anything other than phpBB that uses BBcode ?
http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/faq.php?mode=bbcode

BBcode looks like a small subset of HTML, with square brackets [] instead of angle brackets <>.

Some WikiEngines (such as InterFlow) do allow full HTML markup.
There are also some AlternativeTextFormattingRules.
