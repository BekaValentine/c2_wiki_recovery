The unending drive to improve upon things.  "New and Improved" is on every product in the grocery store.  There is a drive within us to constantly strive toward perfection.

Often used sarcastically, meaning the new version is not better even though it claims to be.  Sometimes simpler is better.  KeepItSimpleStupid (KISS method) often produces the most efficient, cost effective, and longer lasting method/product.

"It may be the delight in Order, the pleasure of getting a thing just so -- as in dancing a minuet.  ...The Order of the Divine Mind, empodied in the Divine Law, is beautiful.  What should a man do but try to reproduce it, so far as possible, in his daily life?" CsLewis

I never enjoyed Ballet.  I've never been a perfectionist.  "Close enough" was always my motto.  But after reading Lewis' comments, I get it.  There ''is'' something in us that drives us to strive for perfection.  I can see why the ballerina pushes herself to get that move "just so."  I do the same in my job. -- BrucePennington
