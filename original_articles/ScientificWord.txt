ScientificWord is a Typesetting Product
* you can choose to typeset complex technical documents with LaTeX, the industry standard for mathematics typesetting. Because of its superior precision and quality, publishers and writers of scientific material use LaTeX extensively.

I've seen ScientificWord, at least as of a few years ago. If all you want to do is to mouse around, it's fine. However, it didn't then have any ability to create custom commands. There was no equivalent to the TeX \def or the LaTex \newcommand construct. In ScientificWord, if I wanted to enter the radius of the earth as the letter r with a subscript of e, I could do that. It would dutifully insert r_{e} into the code. And if I wanted to copy and paste, I could. But I couldn't do anything like: 

  \providecommand{\radiusEarth}{\ensuremath{r_{e}}} % Requires LaTeX2e 
  \providecommand{\radE}{\radiusEarth} 
The last is a trick I learned from an article by Leslie Lamport to give me a fully-named command for archival use, and an abbreviation for actual typing. Then, if I find that I can use the astrosym package, which has all the old symbols for the planets and constellations, I can change all the instances of the radius of the earth with just one edit. And when I type a paper and want the radius, I don't think about mousing around. 

ScientificWord is a crutch. However, it has links to Maple and MathCad, which might be good for you. -- EricJablow
