Have you ever gotten the impression that Apple is some kind of cult? It seems to me that a lot of Mac users are ravenously defensive of their OperatingSystem and are constantly trying to convert people. Not to mention all of the fluffy self-help-esque pep-talking, such as in MacOsx...

* Cult members: slavishly follow the teachings of their glorious leader/Messiah, hanging on his every word
* Mac users: slavishly follow the teachings of SteveJobs, hanging on his every word

* Cult members: the leader has a RealityDistortionField
* Mac users: SteveJobs has a RealityDistortionField

* Cult members: gladly pay large sums to the cult as a condition of salvation
* Mac users: gladly pay large sums to Apple as a condition of getting hardware

* Cult members: dress all in white (it was orange before The Leader changed his mind)
* Mac users: have all their devices in white (it was translucent blue before SteveJobs changed his mind)

* Cult members: worship in temple-like facilities being created rapidly around the world
* Mac users: worship in temple-like Apple Stores being created rapidly around the world

''If Apple is a cult, Microsoft is a religion - the only difference between the two being market share. (Linux, of course, is the radical extremist sect of the other major religion.)''
