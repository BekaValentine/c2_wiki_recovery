''Sometimes we use the word '''''good''''' when we really mean personally '''''useful''''' - '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20141208

Perhaps much of the not so useful debate surrounding the use of the word "good" could be avoided if we would carefully consider what we mean when we use either of the words.

Thus the pages GoodThing and BadThing might more profitably be split between moral preferences and the user's preferences as defined in the pages:
* UsefulThing 
* UselessThing
* BadVsUseless
