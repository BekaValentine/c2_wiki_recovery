Living in Vasteras, Sweden. Wants to do XP. Swedish CurriculumVitae is at http://vmlinux.org/jakob/jecv.pdf.

If the CurriculumVitae looks at all interesting, please contact me with job specifics and I may be able to do a more targeted version. It could happen that I have more to offer you than what fitted this generic CurriculumVitae.

(I'll get around to do an English version. In the meantime, you can marvel at how international computer jargon is.)
