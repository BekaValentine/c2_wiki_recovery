One of SixThinkingHats.BlueHat.MetaThinking

Process and procedure.

Many SixThinkingHats discussions start with an InitialBlueHat and end with a FinalBlueHat.

In a live discussion, BlueHat''''''s can also be inserted on the fly to respond to situations as they develop. Maybe nobody can come up with anything under a certain hat, or maybe an important contradiction has become obvious and needs to be resolved. Situations like these might call for the sequence of hats to be adjusted or changed. Such changes can only be made under the BlueHat.
