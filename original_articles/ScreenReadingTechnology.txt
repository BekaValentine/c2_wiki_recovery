There is need for ScreenReadingTechnology. It is not only a GoodThing, it is the law in some countries. This page is one starting point which can be used to raise the level of awareness of special needs which exist that need to be considered in the creation of information on the web (including this wiki). Perhaps we can use this page to move in this direction by discussing and providing examples of what can be done by those who create content.

Applications that need to be considered include:
* email
* word processing
* internet
----
Assistive technology for the blind does not automatically handle email as a side effect of being able to support internet access and word processing; it requires separate design and implementation.

After this you can begin visiting some sites dealing with the topic

There are tools available to help the developer experience some of the web accessibility issues encountered

* http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/existingtools.html. 

Some of tools will actually simulate what is seen by a person with low vision. 
* Vischeck provides tools to help designers understand the web experience of users with several forms of color blindness.

Windows XP has a built-in read-aloud feature called Narrator that works similarly to a screen reader. It does not work identically, but it can give you the experience of what one who can not see might experience on various content, including your own pages, various websites or software application.

MacOsx has built-in read-aloud features which can be enabled in the Spoken User Interface section of the speech system preferences. It can read the text associated with whatever GUI item is under the mouse pointer and can read text in windows when selected by the mouse.
