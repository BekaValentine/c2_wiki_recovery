This tag would not be needed if there are frequent participation in a survey. However given peoples reluctance in using RealName in posts, and that C2 is currently still in "restricted mode", there can be days/weeks in between entries made to a survey. So the original author may wish to increase awareness of such "open surveys" by adding this tag. -- dl 
* again got "inspired by CC" since his W''''''hoIsActiveOnWiki appear to have rolled off R''''''ecentChanges and he is still interested in response
