 Switch to another buffer.
 
 The buffer name is selected interactively by typing a substring.  The
 buffer is displayed according to `iswitchb-default-method' -- the
 default is to show it in the same window, unless it is already visible
 in another frame.
 For details of keybindings, do `C-h f iswitchb'.

 (require 'iswitchb)
