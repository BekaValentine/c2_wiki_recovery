''Hi Bob. You might want to look at the TextFormattingRules and not use mono-space - it's easier to read if you use bullet points for example. Welcome to WardsWiki, you might want to read WelcomeVisitors, and we look forward to your contributions.''

You also seem to be heading to a bit of a WalledGarden, which is frowned upon here. If you think it is relevant to the purpose of this wiki, then linking pages like ActionResearch into relevant other pages might help (as it happens, this author does have an interest in ActionResearch, but that may not be widely shared by other readers)
