'''Motivation''':

You're writing a shell script.  You want the reader of the script to know, right off the bat, how to use the program (the usage message).  You want the script to have a usage message when the user asks for something goofy.  You do not want the usage message and the usage comment to get out of sync.

'''Solution:'''

Make the first comment in the shell script the actual text of the usage message.  Use "different" comments (e.g., "##") to distinguish it from the other comments and the leading #!/bin/sh.  Then, for your usage function in the script, use the command
 sed -n '/^##/s/^## //p' "$0"

'''Typical uses:'''	
	1. I use it as described.
	2. Emacs's documentation for commands and functions works roughly the same way.
