Call For Collaboration

The wiki media is perfectly suited for collaboration. A CallForCollaboration can be thought of as similar to a call for papers for a seminar or proceeding. It is a marshalling of resources based upon common interest in the creation of a RealWorldObject or a RealWorldProcess utilizing the synergy of many people working as one, but supplying their several mind sets, abilities, and resources (cf. CrowdSource''''''ing).

Collaboration is hard. A media (even as cool as wiki) is not sufficient to enable collaboration.
* A call for papers is a call for individuals to present what they know - easy.
* A call for collaboration is a call for individuals to work together - hard.

I would like to work together in a synergistic way to create software and value (and I guess I am not alone in this). I am trying this on a local level in Chicago (but even this, with face to face communication, is hard).

Collaboration requires several principles to be in place:
* a unifying purpose
* a clear understanding of who does what
* an integration plan
* unambiguous interfaces
(for collaborating software components I also add, OnceAndOnlyOnce and unambiguous interfaces) -- PaulCaswell

There are some other useful principles at: http://www.communitycollaboration.net/id22.htm (''this link is broken'') Summarized by the following:
* Start With a Unifying Purpose
* Create, maintain and update SimplePracticalMissionStatements
* Set Goals and Objectives
* Believe in what you are Doing and the People who are Doing It
* LeadershipByExample
* Coordination - Organize and Document Efforts

* Underlying these rules, always remember three fundamental principals.

With VideoConferenceMeeting''''''s, A CallForCollaboration can convene participants in a relatively short (almost within minutes) period of time, providing many of above characteristics to be employed.
* examples: 
** GoogleHangouts
** OoVoo
