In my opinion, the phrase "pun not intended" is quite silly, especially in written work. If you notice a pun in what you've written, and are willing to take the time to write "pun not intended", and the pun is '''really''' so horrible that you can't '''stand''' to be associated with it or seen as responsible for it - why not reword yourself? Personally, I'd rather take pride in my serendipitous wit. And thus I do say "pun very much intended" in real life, in such situations. -- KarlKnechtel
