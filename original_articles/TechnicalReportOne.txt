A non-normative report for TheCppStandardsCommittee on extensions to the CeePlusPlus standard library. Its official name is the "Proposed Draft Technical Report on C++ Library Extensions", but nicknamed "TR1", because the extensions it defines are contained in a namespace call "std::tr1".

As the report itself states:
	 :	''Some of the library components in this technical report may be considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but they are not currently part of any C++ standard. Some of the components in this technical report may never be standardized, and others may be standardized in a substantially changed form.''

However, it's a safe bet that studying this report will give some insight into what's ahead for the standard library.

A draft is available at http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/papers/2005/n1745.pdf.

Some highlights:
* BoostSharedPtr (boost::shared_ptr<> and boost::weak_ptr<>) templates, replacing the problematic auto_ptr<> [AutoPtr]
* Improved support for FunctionalProgramming (of a sort)
* RegularExpression objects
* PseudoRandomNumber generation objects
* Tuple and fixed-size containers

See VariadicTemplatesForGnuCpp for an example implementation.
