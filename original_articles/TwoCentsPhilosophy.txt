''[Shouldn't this really be, "Two Cent Philosophy," referring to the value we place on such a thing?]''

EwDijkstra once said: "...  it seems there are societies in which philosophers still have some intellectual standing."

This even true for WikiSociety, and it's fun. 

But really, I wonder how many participants to the philosophical "debates" take philosophy (and themselves) seriously. And how one is expected to take philosophical arguments seriously.
