A Java archive that is prepared to start the main() method of a specified class.
This seems to work like an executable file, e.g. on MS Windows, double-clicking on the Jar file
will launch the VM to start the specified class in the archive.

It, however, requires that the JavaRuntimeEnvironment be already installed on the system.
