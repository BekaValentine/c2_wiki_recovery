 Too soft is RhymeMe:
 HaiKu, dry as winter thorns
 Makes a sharper point.

HaikuMe is at least as relevant to wiki as DeleteMe. It suggests you want to put your point succinctly, but aren't much good with HaiKu and would appreciate help. HaikuMe could be clearer on this, I admit. Consider that a challenge.

''Why add noise?''

They're not noise. They're requests. HaikuMe occurred when I read your contribution to PoemWiki. Since your contribution wasn't a poem, but wasn't drivel either, I wanted to make it into signal. So I tried to do that. Now I'll admit the result isn't great Haiku ... but one thing that's been entertaining me on the poetry pages is that '''the poems are getting better over time'''. As someone used to noodling poetry alone, I'm very curious about whether this will keep working like that.

Well, for what it's worth, I like it. How about a spring motife?:

     Grass Growing greener
  Reaching, striving to the sun
     Gas up the Lawn Boy

Or a morning one?:

      Slow roasted coffee
     Waiting for discovery
    Accept no substitution
