OpenDocument
* Was approved as an OASIS standard on May 1, 2005
* Became an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 26300, on May 3, 2006.
* Was developed by the OASIS industry consortium, 
* Is based upon the XML-based file format originally created by OpenOffice.org
* Is an open XML-based document file format for office applications to be used for documents containing text, spreadsheets, charts, and graphical elements. 
* Makes transformations to other formats simple by leveraging and reusing existing standards wherever possible. 
* As an open standard under the stewardship of OASIS, OpenDocument also creates the possibility for new types of applications and solutions to be developed other than traditional office productivity applications.
* Short for the OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications 
* Is an open document file format for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents (including memos, reports, and books), spreadsheets, databases, charts, and presentations. 
* Supports storing metadata (data about the data) by having a set of pre-defined metadata elements, as well as allowing user-defined and custom metadata. 
* Has predefined metadata including: Generator, Title, Description, Subject, Keywords, Initial Creator, Creator, Printed By, Creation Date and Time, Modification Date and Time, Print Date and Time, Document Template, Automatic Reload, Hyperlink Behavior, Language, Editing Cycles, Editing Duration, and Document Statistics."
* Layout is controlled by a variety of attributes. These include page size, number format, paper tray, print orientation, margins, border (and its line width), padding, shadow, background, columns, print page order, first page number, scale, table centering, maximum footnote height and separator, and many layout grid properties."
* Headers and footer can have defined fixed and minimum heights, margins, border border line width, padding, background, shadow, and dynamic spacing."

Reasons it will enjoy wide acceptance:
* As an individual or business user
** You want OpenDocument because it will give you choice and lower prices. 
* As a government official
** You want OpenDocument because it will create a freer market and make your voters less dependent on a single software vendor. 
* As a librarian or archivist
** You want OpenDocument because it can preserve today's history for hundreds of years. 
* As a developer
**You want OpenDocument because you won't be dependent on the whims of one of your competitors who doesn't have your best interests at heart. 

Alternatives:
* Microsoft
** is pushing its OpenXml document format as an alternative to ODF, plans to seek ISO approval for OpenXml as well. 
** plans to support interoperability with ODF documents as they start to appear and will not oppose its standardization or use by any organization 
* In March 2006, Microsoft Chairman and ChiefSoftwareArchitect BillGates, speaking at the Microsoft Office System Developers Conference, announced that the company has joined with 39 other organizations to form the Open XML Formats Developer Group. 

Conclusions:

* In the past
** the main interface for working with information in documents was the software application (an office suite or a text editor of some kind
* In the Future 
** the main interface will be the document itself, no matter what application you use. The OpenDocument Format will move the world from an application-centric model of computing into a document-centric model of computing. This will mean the creation of new business processes will be as easy as typing a memo on a PC or working with a small connected device. OpenDocument Format will make access to document data easier. It will give hope to organizations that longer document life cycles and smoother business processes will emerge.
