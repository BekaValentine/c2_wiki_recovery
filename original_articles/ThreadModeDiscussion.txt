A WikiTag used as a reminder to work in DocumentMode. This tag will usually be placed in a section of the page reserved for ThreadMode conversation while the area above is reserved for DocumentMode refactoring. In order to encourage refactoring, participants are asked to add their WikiName (see RealNamesPlease) to the section marked "Contributors" instead of signing individual comments. All comments may be refactored into the DocumentMode text and signatures moved to the "Contributors" list.

* Participants should consider RefactorByCondensingQuestionAnswerPair when answering commented questions.

At some point during the refactoring process anyone may elect to move the ThreadModeDiscussion to a new page linked as the original document's WikiName''''''+Discussion. This sometimes impedes incremental refactoring, however, and so should be performed only if the original page becomes noticeably more readable. Ideally, the comments provided in ThreadModeDiscussion are wisely '''molded''' into the DocumentMode text and effectively eliminated from the ThreadMode conversation altogether.
