Are there customizable versions of Eliza?  So we could maybe teach her to respond to programming matters and ask technical questions?

''Yes. The most famous and popular such is AliceBot, with the XML-based AIML language. See'' http://www.alicebot.org/alice/aiml.html

''There are others that are specialized for IRC, MUDs, etc.''  Not to mention those programmed to "talk dirty" to customers on pr0n web-sites.  

''Don't forget Dr. Sbaitso - the Creative Labs "talking eliza". . . "Perhaps in your dreams it was great"''
