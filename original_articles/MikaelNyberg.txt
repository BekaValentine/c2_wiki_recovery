This is my id page on WikiWiki. I found out about wikis years ago, and have often used them (this wiki in particular) to get information about programming-related topics, but (I must admit) not contributed a lot myself. Whether this will change, I'm not sure, but now at least I can properly sign my writing if I want to.

I live in Oslo, Norway. I first accessed the WWW in 1989 using Mosaic. -- MikaelNyberg

Haha, I just realized this is wrong, since Mosaic was released in 1993. Must have been Lynx back in '89. At least I accessed the Internet then, and whenever WWW is defined as having come into existence, I was there... -- MikaelNyberg

''Lynx didn't access the Web before the end of '92. See http://www.ku.edu/~grobe/early-lynx.html.''
