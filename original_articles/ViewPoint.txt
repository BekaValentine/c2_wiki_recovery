''If indeed the differences are insufficient to make or break the acceptance of the concept by end users, then I would like to hear Clifford's comments on his and Costin's model of wiki. But since Costin is close to having a real product, that additional effort does merit a serious consideration by people interested in setting up wiki communities. -- DavidLiu''
