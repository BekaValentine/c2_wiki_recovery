I'm a Macintosh programmer in the SF Bay area. 

''TheTimelessWayOfBuilding'' was loaned to me in the early 80s by a psychologist friend in E. Lansing. Its sphere of influence has really grown since then. I'm rereading the books in preparation for a group programming project with some members of the BMUG Macintosh Programmers Sig.
