Wiki normally generates pages on demand. However, some select pages are converted to html in a weekly batch process. These pages can be quickly served to readers seeking an overview of popular wiki topics. 

	* http:/ppr/wiki/ -- mirrored wiki pages (more below)
	* RoadMaps, RecentChanges -- consulted to identify popular pages

Readers at distant locations or with slow or expensive internet connections can download a zipped version of each select set of html pages. For example ...

	* http:/ppr/wiki/ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap/html.zip

will retrieve the XP roadmap and the pages it cites, all pre-converted to html and ready to be browsed from a local disk. Use a utility like PKUNZIP (http://www.pkware.com/) or Win''''''Zip (http://www.winzip.com) to install the downloaded files.

We encourage operators of websites around the world to download these zips on a regular schedule and serve them to wiki readers in their vicinity so long as they agree to our MirrorTerms.

Although sites do not seem eager to mirror wiki, visitors from around the world have found the zip files a convenient way to preview wiki. These international domain counts are for zip files downloaded this last week.

There should be a (read only??) WikiMirroringService (not unlike UseNet) that sends updated pages to a select few hosts (like someone with a permanent uplink on GnuTella or FreeNet, and some web servers too).

What is Ward's stance and position on Mirroring c2.com content?
