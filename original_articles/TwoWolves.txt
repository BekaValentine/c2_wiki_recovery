'''''Grandfather''''': ''What troubles you grandson?''

'''''Grandson''''': ''I am so angry because the other boys tease me.''

'''''Grandfather''''': ''I too have felt this anger. Inside me a great battle rages. Two wolves fight to dominate my spirit. Both wolves are powerful and strong. One is fearful, angry, arrogant, spiteful, and suspicious. The other is courageous, tolerant, humble, kind, and trusting. The same fight goes on inside you, and all human beings.''

'''''Grandson''''': ''Which wolf will win?''

'''''Grandfather''''': ''The one you feed.''

This is an old Native American story but I find it remarkably relevant in this age of social media, trolling, and relational aggression.
