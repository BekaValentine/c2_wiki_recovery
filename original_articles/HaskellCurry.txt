''Talk about a guy who will be remembered through history! His first name became a programming language (HaskellLanguage) ''[as did his middle]'', and his last name became a verb (CurryingSchonfinkelling). I'm going to Wikipedia to see whether he first coined the phrase "I will brook no argument"...''
