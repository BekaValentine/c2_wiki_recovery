Nick has been a geek since the days when he programmed the ZX Spectrum and dreamt of Jet Set Willy. He has officially worked in software since 1993, but wrote many small systems used by commerce from the age of 19. Today, his software foundations stand firmly in the ObjectOriented and he is forever excited with OO. 

Nicks other interests include off-road mountain biking, digital photography, snowboarding and other similar activities. Nick can be contacted at nick.robinson@lab49.com.
