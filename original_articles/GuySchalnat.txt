I'm a C++/C program with eight years of experience (4 in C++) as of 1999, much of it on my own projects.  Patterns just seem like common sense codified, and thus I'm quite interested.  Why learn from your own mistakes when you can learn from others?

Currently working for Compuware (http://www.compuware.com).  I think I'll lurk for a while and see if anything strikes me.  Email is mailto:gschal@infinet.com

Now let's see how this looks...
