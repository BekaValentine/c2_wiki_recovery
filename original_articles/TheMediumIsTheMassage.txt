Classic book by MarshallMcLuhan (ISBN 1584230703)

You can have a look, for example, at M.Mcluhan's "Understanding Media" whose Chapter 1 (Part I) is called "The Medium is the Message".

To clarify: Mc''''''Luhan said "The medium '''is''' the message". He later wrote TheMediumIsTheMassage, intentionally making that title a little bit of a joke.

Thus neither is an incorrect quote, they are both correct quotes, the original version was "message", and Mc''''''Luhan's joke version is "massage".

The Medium Is The Massage is also a gramophone record (I happen to possess a copy).
