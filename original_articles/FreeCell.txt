Better than Solitaire.

Much better than Solitaire. I have been playing a game called Spider Solitaire. Hardest game I've ever played. Haven't won yet. Tried to put the game on this screen, but I can't figure out how.

Some games of FreeCell have no solution [http://www.cs.uu.nl/~hansb/d.freecell/freecellhtml.html]. However, the FreeCell program distributed with MicrosoftWindows has a fixed (and relatively small) number of games, all of which have solutions except #11982.

FreeCell Solver (http://fc-solve.berlios.de/) is a CeeLanguage program created by Shlomi Fish. A lecture about it, "Freecell Solver - Evolution of a C Program," can be found at http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/.

I used to prefer FreeCell, but now I prefer Solitaire with "Draw Three" and Vegas scoring. I find it quite deep and subtle.

FreeCell and many other solitaires are available for MacOsx in the ''Solitaire Till Dawn X'' app from http://www.semicolon.com/ The clickability is great, and the cards feature beautiful portraits by Van Gogh, da Vinci, etc. Hmm... it's almost dawn here now...

I think that FreeCell is an excellent learning tool that gives some general guidelines as to how solve nebulous problems.  In fact, I could argue that eveything that I've needed to know about life I learned from FreeCell... (see ImportantFreeCellLessons).
