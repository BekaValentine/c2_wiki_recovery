"The chaordic design process has six dimensions, beginning with purpose and ending with practice."  This looks like the How-to part of making a Chaordic organiation happen.
----
The six dimensions are:

1 '''Develop a Statement of Purpose'''

2 '''Define a Set of Principles'''

3 '''Identify All Participants'''

4 '''Create a New Organizational Concept'''

5 '''Write a Constitution'''

6 '''Foster Innovative Practices'''


-------

I am initially concerned about the money being asked for by the ChaordicCommons for assistance.  

''I am initially concerned about how vague the first 5 "dimensions" are, how magical the 6th "dimension" is and how these activities can be called "dimensions".  Is there a vector with these 6 dimensions?''
