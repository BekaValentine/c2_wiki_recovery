Partially dragging over a word or a sequence of adjacent words makes them into a link, immediately after releasing the mousekey: it initially produces a 
	* '''Target Page Or File''' with a default WikiName, based on the selected text, and a
	* BidirectionalLink. 

I used this technique for my own modified editor. It's very comfortable and even Microsoft has not implemented it in WinWord as a basic operation.

A generalization for the ''Drag And Link Option'', useful for a WysiwygWiki, is the DragAndSelectOption.

Fridemar: this usage model intrudes into the flow of writing. I can type WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo or [[Words Smashed Together Like So]] or *Words Smashed Together Like So* (in various Wiki syntaxes) without interrupting my typing to reach for the mouse. While a facility like you describe is useful (and provided) in StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage editors it seems to me that much of what we do on Wiki is either simpler or more complex; the complex stuff needs a Wiki RefactoringBrowser. I'd be more interested in seeing a feature which suggested links to me as I typed, showing WikiNames containing the current word; the most common reason (apart from spelling) that I come back to edit pages in Wiki is to ''reorder'' phrases (not just highlight them) to convert them to links -- BrianEwins

Brian:  A db-based '''Related Wiki names Suggester''' would be indeed a nice 
tool. My tool e.g. produces from the selected text above (in one stroke) RelatedWikiNamesSuggester (out of: 'related Wiki names suggester') and the suggested page and lets you go on editing there.  -- Fridemar
