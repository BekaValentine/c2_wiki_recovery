'''EndemeSet'''

The BusinessTalentEndemeSet is an EndemeSet for describing cognitive business talents and aptitudes.

[Lol.  Mine is JERK, though I suppose we're supposed to take it seriously and use all the letters in a sequence that indicates ranking.  Looks like an EndemeSet is a generalisation of the notion behind the GeekCode and various similar letter-based coding schemes.  What happens if you need more than 26 characteristics?]

(There is some similarity between geek codes and endemes. You might metaphorically think of a geek code as like a bitwise enumeration, and an endeme as like an ordered bitwise enumeration.)

If you need more than 26 characteristics, then you are either looking at two EndemeSet''''''s that have been conflated, or you are looking at something that needs to be converted into an EndemeList.

For example if you were trying to use the endeme set on this page for football players for an NFL team, you might start adding things for various kinds of physical intelligences such as 'balance', 'speed', 'size', 'intimidation', 'taking pressure', 'quick thinking' etc. and you would soon run past 26. In this case you would divide out the endeme set into two, perhaps one called MentalBusinessTalentEndemeSet, and one called AthleticTalentEndemeSet, or something.

As an example of the second situation, if you started adding various more precisely defined skills to the EndemeSet like 'filing', 'bookkeeping', 'running meetings' etc. you would soon run past 26 items. What you would then do is cull your EndemeSet and identify those items that were core EndemeCharacteristic''''''s, and other items that needed to be in a list each item of which would have a profile defined by those core items. For example, if you had culled 'Running Meetings' out of this EndemeSet into an EndemeList, you might end up with the first entry of the following EndemeList:
