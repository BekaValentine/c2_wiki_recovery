Over the years, you have developed a personal practice or design structure that you have successfully used on at least three separate projects.  You benefit from writing this practice in pattern form and giving it a name.

You have not yet seen others use this practice.  But this may only be because they, too, have yet to post it...

Is there a good way to share or notate this personal practice on Wiki without implying that it is already a timeless industry best practice?

How about calling it a ProtoPattern instead of a Pattern?

I kind of like PersonalPattern. Says what it means.
