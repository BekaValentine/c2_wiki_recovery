Original author of the LinuxKernel, implemented borrowing ideas from AndrewTanenbaum's Minix (later completely rewritten with POSIX compatibility as the sole goal). Previously worked for TransMeta, a company whose product is a VLIW microprocessor that (with the help of some clever JIT-like software) executes x86 code. Allegedly it's very fast and very low-power.

Currently works for the OpenSourceDevelopmentLab.
