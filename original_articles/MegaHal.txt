MegaHAL is a "conversation simulator": a computer program which responds in natural language to what you type, written by Jason Hutchens, who is now working with Artificial Intelligence on an exciting project to create "true" AI. It is able to "learn" what to say by observing the things which you write to it, and is therefore not limited to the English language.

More like a first cousin to MarkvShaney.

Wouldn't it be practical to simulate/generate tutorial conversations in a more restricted problem domain than mathematics?

At moment Balwin's best MegaHal conversation runs like this: http://megahal.alioth.debian.org/Best.html.  

How long will it take that MegaHal produces a tutorial dialog (completely autonomous or taking the changing roles of Q or A towards a human): http://home.att.net/~baldwin.dick/Intro/Java004r.htm?
