ShannonInformation is a quantifiable notion of what information (or data) is, developed by ClaudeShannon at BellLabs. The idea is that data that you know is going to appear has '''low''' information content, and data that surprises you has '''high''' information content.

There is a formula: H = log2(1/p(n)).

It's quite cool and radical.
