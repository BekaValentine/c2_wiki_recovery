''Some ways Desktop folders can be used with wiki '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20121030
----
The most frequent use made of folders by users is as a place to collect and store files. There are other collections and ways to store files, and other artifacts which require just a little memory space and a great deal of flexibility in making your way around this wiki

One of the other ways folders may be used is to quickly and easily personally organize internet artifacts using the artifactory known as a shortcut. Shortcuts are not new, but here is a way you can save them using your own personal External Categories system. 

Create a top level folder called wikisites. In it create another folder representaing this wiki, call it c2, or WardsWiki, or whatever you like. It is in this desktop subfolder wikisites/c2/ that you will create a grouping of folders organized under whatever topics or categories you like.

I can suggest several:
* Projects
* Programming
* People
* AgileAndExtreme 
* UsingWiki
* Roadmaps

The good thing about such organization is that it places little loading on the wiki server.

Here is the good part:
* While it is not AutomaticExternalCategorization it is ExternalCategorization and can be reduced to a drag and drop operation 
** Drag the link from the page be it 
*** RecentChanges
*** HomePage
*** Category List such as one might find when backlisting of a topic of interest - like CategoryWiki, or CategoryRoadmap
** Drop it into the folder into the desktop folder representing the external category you have created for it
