When involved in design or programming for scenarios involving components and processes for which FailureIsNotAnOption:

For those requiring FailSafe operation:
* Provide Backup equipment or software to fix each possible failure.
* Hot Backups
* Backup or duplication of critical components, processes, or data

Sample Pseudocode for FailSafe items:
* On Failure Fixit
** This requires specific information or knowledge of the error, its location and severity, and for multiprocessing scenarios, the dependent items for which the process is a precedent
