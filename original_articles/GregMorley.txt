Fascinated by design philosophies and logic. A combination of 'Thinking in Java' (Bruce Eckel) and "Focault's Pendulum" (Umberto Eco) introduced me to this absorbing subject. Email address is mailto:greg.morley@btopenworld.com

After spending five years and lots of money studying industrial psychology in Cape Town, GregMorley quit his degree in 1997 to study a diploma in information technology, offered by the UniversityOfCambridge, facilitated by the Computer Science Institute (http://www.csc.co.za) in Cape Town.

Now head of an Internet start-up in the UK, Greg has combined design patterns and logic theory with his background in medical anthropology and psychology to break new ground in multicultural project management methodologies.
