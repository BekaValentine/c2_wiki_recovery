POT is a persistancy layer that lets the programer persist almost any thinkable object tree.

It can be found at http://pot.forgeahead.hu/ 

Its similar to ThePrevayler but lets you create a object tree in any way one feels like.

Questions:
	* For which language?
	* ThePrevayler persists object *graphs*, doesn't it?
