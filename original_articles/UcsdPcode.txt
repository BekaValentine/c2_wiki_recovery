Also known as the UcsdPsystem.

UCSD-P code (or simply UCSD-P) was a virtual machine used
as a foundation for such languages as UCSD Pascal and
DigitalResearch C-BASIC (CeeBasic).

This allowed the UCSD-P runtime "engine" to be implemented
on the CPU & OS of choice, and take code written on some
other machine (already compiled) and run the "MachineCode"
on the new target without change.

One might say it allowed "WriteOnceRunAnywhere" -- or
something like that.
