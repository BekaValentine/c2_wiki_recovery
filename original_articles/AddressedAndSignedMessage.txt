If the list of contributors becomes unhandy, it may be practical to factor them out to a separate page and expand their identity there, e.g. TheGangOfFour, TheBourbakiGroup.

On the other hand, it can be used by semi anonymous users, who identify their actions with some idea, presented on a WikiPage, e.g. :
	* FriendlyPeerContributor
