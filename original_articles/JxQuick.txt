Quick is a tool for generating and processing XML. Arbitrary object structures can be converted into trees of XML elements. Cross-linked XML documents can be converted into structures of objects. 

Quick is a data modeling system for Java. Quick fully supports Java inheritance, including abstract and interface elements. The developer is given fine-grained control over code generation, so the generated code can extend and interoperate with pre-existing classes. 

Quick works with Java Beans and Bean Property Editors. Developer-provided Bean Property Editors allow the use of custom data types (Java classes) when processing XML attributes and simple elements with text content. 

Quick provides a thread-safe framework (the ocm package) for simple and complex data transformations.
