SiteScooper is an AvantGo style web site reader and manipulator for the PalmPilot.  It consists of a set of perl scripts, plus user contributed site files to define individual site formats. From their web page at http://sitescooper.org :

	 :	Sitescooper automatically retrieves the stories from several news websites, trims off extraneous HTML, and converts them into formats you can read on your Palm computing device for later reading on-the-move. It maintains a cache, and will avoid stories you've already read. It can handle 1-page sites, 1-page with diffing, 2-level and 3-level sites, and it's very easy to add a new site to its list. Even if you don't have a Palm handheld, it's still handy for simple website-to-text conversion.
