''Given that TwikiClone appear to have a high adoption rate in Corporations, see WikiInTheNews regarding Orbis for example, would the community think our problems would be lessened if WardsWiki is using a similar scheme to TwikiWikiEngine? How well is Twiki standing up to spammers and EditWar''''''s?''

Not well.  There were a spate of Twiki exploits in 2005 which caused many sites to switch to other wiki engines.  Twikis are used mostly for closed communities such as intranets, so EditWar''''''s are not such a problem.
