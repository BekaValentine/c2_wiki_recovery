* is a little language that compiles to JavaScript. 
* It adds useful features and smoother syntax while compiling to clean, readable JavaScript. 
* You can use it anywhere you use JavaScript: in the browser, or on the server.
* has exploded in popularity since April 2011.
* It was talked about in every other presentation at JSConf. 
* Itâ€™s made enough waves that some language features popularized by CoffeeScript are planned for inclusion in future versions of JavaScript itself
