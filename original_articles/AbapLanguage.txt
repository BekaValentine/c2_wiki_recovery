''A fourth generation ProgrammingLanguage developed by SapCorporation (SAP AG).''

ABAP/4 stands for Advanced Business Application Programming. It is the programming language that SAP AG has used to develop all of the SAP R/3 business modules, applications, and system management functions.
The current incarnation is called AbapObjects.

ABAP... "German COBOL". ABAP is a very cumbersome language and SAP R3 is a cumbersome development environment.
* ''To me it came across as COBOL without all the things that make COBOL disgusting, but still maintaining its cumbersome verbosity. It also takes a while to get used to the idea of doing everything with a command instead of a function. On the other hand, being able to directly call an SQL query without having to use API functions is kinda nice''.
* ''Full ACK, see example on AbapObjects.''

'''AbapLanguage QuickQuestions'''

'''Q''' Is AbapLanguage going to play any significant role in NetWeaver?

'''A''' Yes. NetWeaver will contain two language stacks: Java (actually, J2EE), and ABAP Objects. The vast majority of the SAP business coding is and will remain for quite some time written in ABAP.

Bet you didn't know this: according the the TIOBE Index 
* ABAP is the 17th most referenced language on the internet! Lots of SAP installations means lots of miserable ABAP programmers, desperately looking for help.
