InstantRunoffVoting is frequently called the AlternativeVote in the UK (although Instant Runoff is more informative).

It is equivalent to the SingleTransferableVote when there is only one position to be filled.

Procedure:

	1. Voters cast preferences 1, 2, 3, ... for the candidates.
	2. Votes are assigned to the candidate who has the First preference (1).
	3. If any candidate has a majority of the votes, they are elected. STOP.
	4. Remove the candidate with the fewest votes, and assign each of their votes to the next available preference (eg 2) expressed on the ballot paper. GO TO 3.
