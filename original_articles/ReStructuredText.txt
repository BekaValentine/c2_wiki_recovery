An enhancement of StructuredText whose primary intended use is PythonLanguage doc strings.  I use it for all kinds of outlining and note making as well. http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

Could someone provide some concise examples of StructuredText or ReStructuredText?  Also, perhaps a concise comparison to Wiki's TextFormattingRules and WhyReinventTheWheel ??  (My assumption here is that the Wiki came first.)

PyLit is LiterateProgramming using ReStructuredText

PanDoc is a conversion tool which can read and write ReStructuredText and convert to other markup (TextFilter) formats.

I heard about ProleText and structure-enhanced text (setext) long before I heard of Wiki.
