Remember Microsoft was a bit late on catching the Internet bandwagon and look where they are now.

Microsoft is also not an early adopter of Xml. But here goes some news

The first two seemingly opposing moves have more in common than the word XML suggests. MicrosoftCorporation is in the business to grab marketshare whichever way it can.

I am also interested in ways and means to develop a trial XmlRpc VbClassic application. -- dl
