Hardly any improvement in software development, to code or process, can easily be justified.

You want to replace your nasty homemade socket interface with a third party library? Why would you? The one you have already works and it OnlyTakesAminute to extend it when the interface changes.

You want to start write unit tests? Even when it OnlyTakesAminute to run the manual tests?

And why on earth did you go to all trouble of scripting the release procedure when it OnlyTakesAminute?

When I'm put on the spot, I sometimes have trouble explaining why I did, or need to do, a couple of days' work in order to speed up something that, on the face of it, doesn't seem all that time-consuming. All I know is that my days are filled with these tedious one-minute tasks. And if I happen to fall into a hypnotic trance, probably induced by mind-numbing boredom and déjà vu, one minute can easily stretch to half a day. -- ChrisSteinbach

''This reminds me of a department secretary who had been charged by the department head to do numerous small tasks each day. Each one was justified as it would "only take ten minutes," but cumulatively they took several hours and impacted her ability to accomplish her other tasks.''

Respond with NotEnoughTime, or simply IdoNotHaveTime

OTOH, HoursOfPreparation can indeed help realize the OnlyTakesAminute task.
