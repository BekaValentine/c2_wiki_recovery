TestOptimal (http://testoptimal.com) is a ModelBasedTestAutomation tool with built-in Data-Driven Testing (DDT) and Combinatorial Testing. It supports both oline testing and offline testing and provides http based integration with other test automation tools.  The same models used for functional / regression testing can be re-purposed for LoadTesting with no changes.
