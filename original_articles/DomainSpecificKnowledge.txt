In one word: "experience"? 

If that is all that is meant by DomainSpecificKnowledge, the term should be abandoned in favour of normal English which we can all understand. Bad terms obscure knowledge by appearing to represent some grand concept. One is forced to make a detour into a jungle of muddled-thinking before finally realizing that the word carries no meaning.

''No, it's not the same as "experience". Say you're writing a piece of software that helps with medical diagnosis. You probably want an experienced doctor and an experienced software developer on your team, at the minimum. They both have "experience", but the doctor has ProblemDomain experience (which would also be useful to someone writing a book, or making a film, about whatever medical conditions your software is concerned with) and the software developer has SolutionDomain experience (which would also be useful to someone writing a web server or a 3D shoot-em-up game). Isn't this obvious?''
