PowerPlant is an object-oriented class FrameWork for developing on MacOs and MacOsx. It's written in C++ with a bit of MultipleInheritance. Some portions of PowerPlant can be used separately (that is, used in certain kinds of code resources that are not full-blown applications). PowerPlant is the most popular framework for C++ Mac programming. Alternatives include MacApp, WxWidgets and MacZoop. Architecural overview:

Metrowerks bundled PowerPlant and its successor, PPx, for years with the CodeWarrior compiler suite. The forward-looking PPx is geared toward Carbon development under Mac OS X. Though Metrowerks has left the Macintosh market for CodeWarrior, an open source community continues to maintain it.
