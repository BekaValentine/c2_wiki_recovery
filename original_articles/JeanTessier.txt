I am a software guy in California's SF Bay Area.

''I used to say I was JustaProgrammer for irony, but the discussion there has turned away from irony so I'm not using that designation anymore.''

I went to school in Montreal, Canada.  He worked in NewJersey before coming to California.

I built DependencyFinder and JarJarDiff.  They are analysis tools to help manage complexity in programs written in the JavaLanguage.

I'm a good friend to JeanPhilippeBelanger.
