Despite popular belief, this is far from the worst film ever made.  Plan 9 is a cheap film, a film that tries to do more than it ought, but at least it tries.  It has brought more joy to the world than "Town & Country", "Love Affair", "Bugsy", "Dick Tracy" and "Ishtar" combined.

''Jeez, what do you have against Warren Beatty? There are plenty of horrible movies that he's not in.''

''I particularly like the one about sunlight being made of many atoms.''
