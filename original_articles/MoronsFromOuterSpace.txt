''They Came, They Saw, They Did a Little Shopping''

A somewhat flawed movie starring Mel Smith and Griff Rhys-Jones.

Most of it is not very memorable, but there are a few good set-piece gags.

My favourite chuckle is the very simple one of the character floating along in his space suit who drifts past the inverted sign saying "Caution: Entering Normal Gravity".  I had such a sign on the door of my room for a while. --FrankCarver
