'''The TgpMethodology Benefits'''

* '''Reduce the gap between business needs and the delivered software'''. In fact, this gap is composed by three gaps: 
** '''Developers gap''' - The gap between the written requirements (in SRS documents) and the delivered software. TGP responds by BusinessProfessionals collaboration on a VisualSharedModel. 

** '''Analysts' gap''' - The gap between the customers desired features and the way they are written as requirements (in SRS documents). TGP responds by IncrementalDevelopment and BusinessProfessionals collaboration.

** '''Domain dynamics gap''' - Future requirement costs rise due to the evolvement of the business domain. TGP responds by its FlexibilityZonesArchitecture, and give its quick and easy answer to this evolution. 

* '''Improves time to delivery'''. The overall benefits of the tight involvement of the BusinessProfessionals through the involvement VisualSharedModel, the flexibility of the TgpArchitecture, the IncrementalDevelopment and the OrganicTesting, sum up to a tangible way to meet the deadline. The TGP AgileSoftwareDevelopment can be expressed as reduced cost.

-- Improves time to delivery compared to what?  That question really goes for all of the benefit statements - it's not clear what you're comparing it to.  If you're comparing it to Waterfall, then it's a meaningless comparison. If you're comparing it to XP or Scrum, then it's interesting.

* '''Improves the software quality'''. Software is more reliable, as it is tested by a net of hundreds and thousands of tests as part of the development process by the development team numerous times (see the OrganicTesting component of the TgpMethodology).  

* '''Improves utilization of the human resources'''. The different roles presented by TGP can make the most of the talent and knowledge of business professionals and developers. In an enterprise, the TGP can take advantage of the great mass of developers and BusinessProfessionals that can be recruited to a project (see ImplementingTgp).
