We use the term multi-dimensional separation of concerns (MDSOC) to refer to flexible and incremental separation, modularization, and integration of software artifacts based on any number of concerns. It overcomes limitations of existing mechanisms by permitting clean separation of multiple, potentially overlapping and interacting concerns simultaneously, with support for on-demand remodularization to encapsulate new concerns at any time.

Realizations of MDSOC can permit incremental identification and encapsulation of concerns, without requiring the use of new languages or formalisms. MDSOC promotes reuse, improves comprehension, reduces the impact of change, eases maintenance and
evolution, improves traceability, and opens the door to system refactoring and reengineering. Thus, it addresses some fundamental limitations in software engineering.
