Here I found a lot of ground breaking thoughts & ideas about WhyWikiWorks and information about WikiHistory which inspires me a lot, connects me to the beginning of it all and thus serves my need for continuity since I consider myself to be ultra-conservative. I like to build on solid ground. And wikiwise this liquid site is most solid ground ;-) -- ManorainjanHolzapfel
