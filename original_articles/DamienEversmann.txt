Hello,

This is my WikiWiki home page.  My web home page is at http://www.eversmann.com .  I am an IT Specialist with IBM (InternationalBusinessMachines).  I have a wife and a son and live in central Ohio.  I started looking at this Wiki because it is one of the first and I wanted to play around with it in the interest of trying to create my own.  I'm a ComputerGeek and I like the challenge.  I've mostly used this page to experiment and play around.  Maybe some day I'll actually put a little more in here about DamienEversmann.

Hi there!  You may find TextFormattingRules helpful.  There's also the WikiWikiSandbox for trying things out, though you're perfectly welcome to test things on your HomePage if you don't mind the clutter.  -- JonathanTang
