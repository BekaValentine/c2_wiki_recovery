Jungle funk band formed in 1980. Meteoric career out of London's dance scene ended when the lead singer, Annabella Lwin, finished puberty. Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as influential, all the way up to the RedHotChiliPeppers.

''"Power rap"? Is that some sort of revisionist term or am I just that out of it? I believe the term at the time was "New Romantic".'' -- KielHodges (just curious)

I was around at the time, bought some of their stuff, never heard the term 'Power Rap'. Didn't come out of the 'dance scene', as there was no such thing then. 

Lwin was gorgeous, I was only 17 at the time, so that's OK.

Punk surf band formed in 1980. Meteoric career out of London's dance scene ended when the lead singer, Annabella Lwin, became old enough to vote. Critically acclaimed and widely regarded as influential, all the way up to TheBeastieBoys.

Does anyone have a link to a picture of BowWowWow?

''Oh, man! This was an 80s'' punk '' band. Why the heck would you want to look at a picture of that?!? The hair alone would give me nightmares. Well, maybe just bring back memories...that would be bad enough.''

A Malcolm McLaren creation of one time Antz and Annabella, only 13 at the time.  Another of Malcolm's cutting edge, African rythym's based electronic pop/punk bands.  Great stuff!
