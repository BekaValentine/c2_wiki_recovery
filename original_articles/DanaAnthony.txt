Dana Anthony became interested in patterns when a group at
KnowledgeSystemsCorporation, begun by BruceWhitenack, was discussing the GangOfFour patterns at lunch time.

She wrote a paper called Patterns for Classroom Education (IanChai has/had this online somewhere) that she worked on
at the 2nd PLoP and was published in the 2nd proceedings.

Now she works at SasInstitute.
