In Apr05 I saw a statement in a sister site where the administrator said:

'''''Anonymous contributions''' are welcomed. '''Anonymous contributors''' are not.''

Do we have something similar on WardsWiki? I am aware Ward has previously stated the preference for anon contributions to be unsigned, but it is not the same as the above statement.
* Is Wards preference based on the preference for DocumentMode pages? Whilst there is a discussion of content going on, people need to be identified, even if temporarily, so the proper context is kept. Any one objects to that line of thinking?

I suppose the statement was made due to experience that "new anonymous contributors" often resist compliance to existing WikiSocialNorms, and many even enjoy debating as an end in itself.

BTW there are a lot of pages on identities, user names, etc and I think interested and capable (rules me out) community members should get together to do a lot of RefactorByCondensingConversation. We need good and balanced guidance for new members of the community who can use RealName''''''s.

On RegularContributors, Ward clearly states: ''Finally, in a few cases it wasn't clear to me who made the contributions so I identified the pages with the author's host machine. There is nothing wrong with being anonymous.''

AnonymousOnPurpose for now. But regulars know who I am.
