''Simple pragmatism'' is the plain and hard-working little sister of the beautiful and alluring ''pure elegance''. If you marry simple pragmatism, be careful. Because simple pragmatism and pure elegance are related, pure elegance will often be tantalizingly near. It is OK to admire her, and even desire her, but you must never try to embrace her. If simple pragmatism catches you in the arms of pure elegance, she will divorce you.
