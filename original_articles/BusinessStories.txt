-------------------------

Looking at the examples of MotherhoodStory, I suspect we're barking up the wrong tree. A BusinessStory describes some discrete chunk of BusinessArchitecture (goals, measures, organisations, workflows, rules), regardless of whether a software system is involved. Arguably, things like a company's mission statement, a company dress code and a "no refunds" policy are all examples of business stories. They describe the business in which the system will be used, not the system itself.

''Amen. I suggest that, from a developer's point of view, a BusinessStory is simply a UserStory about '''collecting UserStories'''.''
