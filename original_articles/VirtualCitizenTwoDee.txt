A kind of GlobalSupercomputer, perhaps using LinuxClustering, where the community 
can freely upload and download RealTime a kind of AbbreviatedAsciiUml
using Mobile or more FeatureRich devices,
to share ideas, information and even implement a virtual NeighborhoodWatch,
allowing Whistleblowing and LawfulIntercept but generally a kind of OpenSource
provision for education and the upholding of Democracy. 
Depicting and simulating the intricacies of relevant 
Financial, Social and Political Networks and Systems, yet specific enough to 
identify real problems and/or opportunities, the FrontPage could
look something like:

*EconomicsEngine
*SocialEngine
*PoliticalEngine
etc.

The pages could be hyperlinked such that users can continuously view, edit 
and modify content interactively, navigating as effortlessly as possible.
Alerts could be sent automatically on an OptIn basis, and uploading could be
done by SMS, WML or HTML. PayPerUse versions could be developed later on
on this foundation, but in an Era where whole Industries are evaporating
and abberations like TrafficHacking are being aimed with DeadlyForce at
innocent pedestrians, the community should take CounterMeasures using available technology.

Simulating economic systems is something I've been playing with, in my spare time, for years.  It's an amusing diversion.  However...  "T''''''rafficHacking [is] being aimed with deadly force at innocent pedestrians?"  Huh?  I'd agree that bad driving is occasionally -- presumably unintentionally -- aimed with deadly force at innocent pedestrians, but I'd hardly call it an organised effort.
