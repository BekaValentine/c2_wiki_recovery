'''''XpPitfalls'''''

	* '''Problem:''' Ergonomics. Pair programming can lead to hunching, squinting, and reaching.
Solution: Make an effort to change your workspace to accommodate pairing. For example: Adjustable keyboard trays; large monitors; increase your font size; put your workstation on a long side of a desk, not in a corner. Take a look at cordless keyboards and mice; Logitech makes a nice wireless keyboard/mouse combo with a receiver that plugs into a USB port and the keyboard connector. Windoze only, but that may change.

Solution: Switch drivers often. Many RMD disorders come from ''sustained'' repetitive motion. If you switch, then the driver's wrist and back gets a break.

	* '''Problem:''' Keyboard hog. One partner will take the keyboard for long stretches. This encourages the navigator to "space out" or to not fully participate.

Solution: Set a timer for 15 minutes. When it rings, switch, and set the timer again. (A loud timer can serve this function for every pair in the room.)

	* '''Problem:''' "But I don't want to pair program all the time!"
Solution: So don't. Pair 80% of the time, or 20%, or whatever works for you. But make sure you make your decision on measured productivity, not on speculation and habit.

Solution: XP does not recommend pairing 100% of the time - only when writing production code. Spikes, and potentially even tests, can be done solo. But once you get used to pair programming, you'll soon find yourself, while programming solo, turning to ask a neighbor, "Hey, could you help me on this?"
