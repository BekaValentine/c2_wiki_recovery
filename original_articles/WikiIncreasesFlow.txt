I have just noticed a little habit I have formed. Every morning I
come into my office with a coffee, sit down and browse around Wiki.
I'm doing it just now, my coffee is finished, and I'm about to
start work.

The great thing is that wiki has put me into that
MentalStateCalledFlow, which is often difficult to get into on
Monday morning.

Thanks, wiki!

Thank you David for this contribution. I find the same sort of thing - I notice a difference on days when there is so much going on that I don't get to look at this wiki. -- JohnFletcher
