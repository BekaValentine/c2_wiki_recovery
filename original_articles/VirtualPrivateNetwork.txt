VirtualPrivateNetwork (VPN) is a network for private use and transported over a public medium such as the Internet. For this virtual network to be private, it is necessary that sound SecurityManagement practices are in place.

Until recently, security for most VPNs are implemented using IpSec mechanisms. These will typically require some configuration of the client machine for the setup, thus introducing challenges in administration of such links.

Other major considerations, from a security perspective, are the issues of identity management and security of the computing environment which the offsite client machine is deployed.
