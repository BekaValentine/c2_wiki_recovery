The use of InformationDevices (ID) to DiscoverAnalyzeRelate (DAR) information in accordance with specified filtering mechanisms customized and refined while in use via AutomatingContextParticipation (ACP)

Scrap the idea of Artificial Intelligence in favor of practical, PersonalAutomatedIntelligence (PAI). With the maturing of the internet, such discovery and information mining mechanisms are the wave of the future for the IndividualInformationConsumer (IIC).

Technologies that are destined to change the way we will interact with our environment.
* Mobile Computing
* PeerToPeer Networking (PTPN)
* Ubiquitous WirelessAccess
* Intelligent SoftwareAgents
* ReachMaintenanceBots (RMB)
Hopefully, big business will encourage these innovations in a way which will increase profits for itself and the users of such technologies as well.

See the following for hints only. No one has yet put it all together for the individual. Maybe you can become a Bicycle''''''Mechanic for this age and turn it into reality - I''''''ndividualInformationFlight not dreamworld and fantasy as in InvisibilityOrFlight.

'''GeneticAlgorithms and FitnessFunction'''
*"It occurred to me that perhaps you could combine GeneticAlgorithms with the basic thrust of AI, which was to get computers to do things '''automatically''' - that perhaps you could evolve a population of programs." 
** Genetic Pragmatism - an exclusive interview with JohnKoza -- EvoNet; August 1998
*"GeneticAlgorithms are based on a biological metaphor: They view learning as a competition among a population of evolving candidate problem solutions. A "FitnessFunction" evaluates each solution to decide whether it will contribute to the next generation of solutions."

AutomatedIntelligence and the role of the new H''''''yperLearning -- Weaving new economy fabric using FourKeyTechnologicalThreads
* S''''''martEnvironment -- First is the "smart" environment, where every artifact you touch or are touched by - cars, houses, toilets, clothes, tools, toys, whatever - is endowed with its own intelligence. The special significance of this intelligence is that it increasingly includes the ability not only to aid humans to learn, but to actively participate in the process of learning itself.
* T''''''eleCosm -- Second is what my colleague GeorgeGilder calls the "telecosm" - the growing BroadbandCommunicationsInfrastructure that makes all knowledge accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime. For both human and non-human learning, the telecosm makes the "best and brightest" available everywhere.
* H''''''ypermediaSoftwareTools -- The third thread is a kit of "hypermedia" software tools needed to navigate through a knowledge-dense universe. In relation to multimedia, hypermedia is an expanded, multi-dimensional version of a book index. Hypermedia provides the technical bridge that leads the user away from informing and toward understanding.
* B''''''rainTechnology -- The fourth and last thread in the matrix of HL technology is brain technology, a broad category representing the application of biology and other sciences to thinking and sensing systems. In a sense, brain tech is the "wild card" in the HL deck. It contributes much of the basic science and technical tools that underlie the other three areas of hyperlearning technology. But it also offers a growing potential for biotechnology that can alter the learning process from the inside out.
