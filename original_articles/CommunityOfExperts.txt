*** ''"First, do no harm." Please use the same care in editing an existing master record as you would use in creating a new record''
*** NEVER remove
**** ''correct and accurate information from a master record (such as classification numbers or subject headings) simply because your institution does not find it useful''
*** NEVER change 
**** ''the basic nature of a master bibliographic record into something different''
*** AVOID 
**** ''including local data or local practices''
*** Be cautious 
**** ''about changing bibliographic records with a different Language of Cataloging''
