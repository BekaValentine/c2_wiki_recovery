Object Arts Ltd., based in London, was responsible for the development of DolphinSmalltalk, a MicroSoft WinThirtyTwo-based version of SmalltalkLanguage. Its two owner-employees were AndyBower and BlairMcGlashan. They founded the company after their previous employer, IntuitiveSystems, began then abandoned development of Dolphin Smalltalk.

As of March 2008 Dolphin is still available and supported but major development has ceased. Bower and Mc''''Glashan are busy elsewhere (AlcheMetrics and MicrosoftResearch respectively), and they have decided that the commercial prospects for Dolphin don't justify the work required to port it to DotNet.
