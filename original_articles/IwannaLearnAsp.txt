ASP (ActiveServerPages) is old technology, and MicrosoftCorporation would like you to learn AspDotNet instead.

But two years into the release of MicrosoftDotNet, most companies still stay with older technology, probably because DotNet is still evolving. (see WindowsVista)
* And three years into DotNet there is a resurgent of demand for RichInternetApplication. So IwannaLearnAsp, with a async XmlHttpRequest twist. Others with similar interests are recommended to start with the very readable Jesse James Garrett article that depicted graphically how Ajax work differently from synchronous WebApplication. See link in AjaxWebApplications.

For people new to the Microsoft world ASP is something they can get started quickly, provided if they can source older software (and essential Microsoft patches).

Since ASP is mostly a hosting medium for JavaScript and VbScript where real complexities and capabilities arise, I suggest we spend some time in getting familiar with these two scripting languages. Links include:
* JavaScript 101 http://javascript.about.com/library/weekly/aa011402a.htm
* VbScript from Step 1 http://www.intranetjournal.com/text/corner/aitken/vbs-1.shtml
* VbScript tutorial http://www.intranetjournal.com/text/corner/wrox/progref/vbt/ch21_15.shtml
