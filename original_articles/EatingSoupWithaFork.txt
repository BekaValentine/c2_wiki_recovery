I propose this easy to understand analogy to describe inefficient tools.  When you have nothing, eating soup with a fork may seem OK, but once you have a spoon, by comparison, the fork seems ridiculously inefficient.

However, EatingSoupWithaFork is more efficient, if you are only trying to get at the bits of meat.

	* There's also DrinkingSoupFromTheBowl, which is messy and inelegant, but it gets the job done without any special tools (except the bowl).  In some countries, this is the preferred method.

	* There's DrinkingSoupWithaStraw, which works for some kinds of soup.

	* There's FeedingYourselfWithBrokenHands, which is about the user and not the tools.

There are many other possible food analogies.  Maybe I like them because of my last name.
