''One of many ways to organize written thoughts '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20111103

While considering thoughts and ideas which are organized and written down, and how to design a means to make them ReachableArtifacts, I considered the use of a SequenceOfUnduplicatedNumbers. This would provide me a way of organizing things found as they exist into a body of ideas and thoughts as I would like to have them and as a result make them easy to find. 

I have been using a numbering machine as a mechanical means of generating a six-digit unique number in my ArtifactNumberingSystem. The number is always a link or association to a resource which has been created such that it always remains "reachable". This machine makes it possible for generation of a million numbers. (I use 900000 of the numbers, purposely reserving those with a leftmost digit 0f zero, using the sequence for 100000 thru 999999. 

This is found to be useful in connecting Topics, Categories, Groups and Collections, allowing them to become  associated or attached artifacts, using this easily utilized notation scheme which is designed by its user to match a personal method of Organizing Thought.
