	* excited by the intellectual community of the wikis
	* PairProgramming is fun and productive
	* C# coder at large
Development Environment:
	* VisualStudio.net 2003 (Upgraded Sept 2, 2003)
	* Eclipse

Currently projects:
	* putting a gui on JPhoto (not active)
	* a traffic logic game (not active)

The traffic logic game is my first stab at a game in C# (Mono).  

PairProgramming:
	* you must really try it before you can comment on it
	* two eyes are better than one
	* I have found a closer matching of skills to be beneficial
	* knowing the goal is critical
