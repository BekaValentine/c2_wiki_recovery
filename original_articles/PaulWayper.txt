Paul Wayper. Hmmmmm - how to describe myself.

Would a simple picture suffice? A short piece of prose ("six foot tall, brown hair, supererogatory and inclined to enjoy novelty")? A detailed question and answer session ("What is your favourite colour?" "I don't have one" "When were you last born?" "September 3 1971" "What station of the London Underground contains none of the letters of the word 'Mackerel'?" "Hey, wait a minute, I'm supposed to ask you that!")? Or is all of this merely a tracing, the skidding pencil leaving an impression of the hand but revealing very little else?

Well, enough mysticism for today, I have other parts of the WikiWikiWeb to explore.
