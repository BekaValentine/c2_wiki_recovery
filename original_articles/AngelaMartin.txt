Hey there ;-)

My PHD research is on the agile customer with a strong focus on the ExtremeProgramming Customer Role.  I also work full-time as a business analyst, on some not so agile projects.  My home page which includes a little more detail about me (and even some links to publications on this topic), it is located at https://www.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~angela/
