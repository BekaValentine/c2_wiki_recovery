	CulDeSac (a.k.a. a ''knot''):	A Wiki page, or an interlinked set of pages, with no outbound links.

Once you're inside a CulDeSac, there's no way out (except through standard navigation links like BackLink''''''s, FindPage, and LikePages). Some WalledGardens are CulDeSac''''''s; creating either is discouraged on Wiki, because neither serves as a GoodEntryPoint to Wiki.

If you run across a CulDeSac, consider
	* adding an outbound link
	* refactoring it into a related page
	* deciding whether it's a DeletionCandidate

Some ShortWikiPages are CulDeSac''''''s.
* UseModWiki has a discussion of algorithms used to find CulDeSac''''''s: http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?KnotDetection.
* See WikiLinkStructureAnalysis
* Contrast with OrphanPage
