(AKA DontModeMeIn)

From WikiMode

(Power-) Users of software don't seem to be very happy, if they have to change modes for simple procedures: Keying versus Mousing, Editing versus Browsing.

E.g. in the AmayaBrowser there is no duality between presentation mode and edit mode.
The same holds for the WikiMode in Emacs. Other examples welcome.

''a vote of disagreement.  I '''hate''' opening (frex) MicrosoftWord and accidentally hitting a letter key, and then, hours later when I close the document, getting asked if I want to save my changes -- what changes!?  Give me a ModeFul editor any day.'' --PeteHardie

As you sing this, it may help the effect to imagine a dozen women, all of
whom resemble Bill Joy, dressed in black and dancing sinuously.

Addicted To vi
(with apologies to Robert Palmer)

 You press the keys with no effect,
 Your mode is not correct.
 The screen blurs, your fingers shake;
 You forgot to press escape.
 Can't insert, can't delete,
 Cursor keys won't repeat.
 You try to quit, but can't leave,
 An extra "bang" is all you need.

 You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--
 Oh yeah?
 You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die
 You know you're gonna have to face it;
 You're addicted to vi!

 You edit files one at a time;
 That doesn't seem too out of line?
 You don't think of keys to bind--
 A meta key would blow your mind.
 H, J, K, L?  You're not annoyed?
 Expressions must be a Joy!
 Just press "f", or is it "t"?
 Maybe "n", or just "g"?

 Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--
 Oh yeah?
 You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die
 You know you're gonna have to face it;
 You're addicted to vi!

 Might as well face it,
 You're addicted to vi!

 You press the keys without effect,
 Your life is now a wreck.
 What a waste!  Such a shame!
 And all you have is vi to blame.

 Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--
 Oh yeah?
 You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die
 You know you're gonna have to face it;
 You're addicted to vi!

 Might as well face it,
 You're addicted to vi!
