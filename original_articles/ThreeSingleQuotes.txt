You can emphasize text by using ThreeSingleQuotes on either side of the text to emphasize. On most systems, this will make the enclosed text '''bold'''. This provides another level of emphasis than is provided by TwoSingleQuotes.

'''This is an example of using ThreeSingleQuotes on either side of an entire sentence.'''

This is an example of using ThreeSingleQuotes on either side of just '''this'''.

Note that this does not work right if you '''use it
over more than''' one line.
