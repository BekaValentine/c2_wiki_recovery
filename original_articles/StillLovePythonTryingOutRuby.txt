''Turn back now. Ruby will ruin you for Python (and Java). Every irritation - every extra keystroke, method call, statement, operator, & 2,000 line module that Ruby would have saved you - will hurt like a paper burn inside your soul. Stay with Python and live in blissful ignorance, while you have the chance.'' --PhlIp (2y Python, 4y Ruby, back to Python now).

In its defense, Python is much more stable at runtime. But that gets us to LuaLanguage...
