From the back of the book:

	 :	Readers will learn to:
** Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex.
** Write automated tests before coding. 
** Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time.
** Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions.
** Use patterns to decide what tests to write.
** Create tests using xUnit, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools.

	 :	This book follows two TDD projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured TDD patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, Test-Driven Development is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques.
