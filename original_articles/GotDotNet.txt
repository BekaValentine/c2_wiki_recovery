http://www.gotdotnet.com is the .NET Framework community Web site.

It is managed directly by Microsoft, and contains a lot of good stuff.
	* message boards
	* resource center
	* workspaces
	* samples
	* downloads
	* tutorials

Workspaces looks a little like SourceForge, but is really far behind.

In many ways it has airs of MicrosoftFakeGrassroots.....
