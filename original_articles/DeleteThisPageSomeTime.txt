DeleteThisPageSoon is often too harsh. 'Soon' seems to mean as soon as another WikiGnome notices it.

Sometimes a page merits considering deletion, but not necessarily '''really soon'''.
Sometimes pages need to be looked at by a few people to see if it will be expanded.
Or it is funny enough (though inappropriate) to let at least some WikiGnome''''''s see it.
