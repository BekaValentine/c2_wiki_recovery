TayloredSoftware, located in Lompoc, CA, is a small custom IT consulting firm focusing primarily on software development and network design, and more recently on software project management. At the moment, I'm not really fully "doing" ExtremeProgramming, though many of my projects are TransitioningTowardExtremeProgramming.

For now, I'll probably add more of my observations about this process to my user page.
