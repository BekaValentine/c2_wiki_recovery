The Chrysler Payroll project is a VisualWorks / GemstoneProject aimed at paying all Chrysler employees well before Year 2000.  It is presently paying about 10,000 monthly-paid management and professional employees.

The project is essentially a batch-processing system. When it is time to pay, it cycles over all employees, computing the pay due, and exporting results.  There are about 15 main external export receivers and a half-dozen different input sources.  There are around a hundred different input transactions.  

A typical payee receives perhaps two to five input transactions in any given month.  The paycheck computation involves the production of about 1200 unique and reported export values.

There are about 700 model classes, 13,000 methods, less than 8 lines per method. There are over 500 test classes, with 6,000 methods, less than 11 lines per method.

The database is around 2.5 GB, grows to about 4 during payment, comes back down after garbage collection.  It will grow continually month to month.

Chrysler has over 6,000 Executives and over one hundred thousand Employees.

Imagine having to wait until the year 2000 to be paid. (I'm kidding - I assume they were paid by other systems.)


I imagine this wiki page will have to be refactored, as the corporation was refactored in 2009.  (The press don't use the word refactored: they said something about the sale of most of its assets to Fiat Group.)

"Chrysler - now run by Italians!" --GaryTrudeau, citing "In Heaven, the police are English, the chefs are French, the engineers are German, the lovers Italian, and it's all run by the Swiss. In Hell, the chefs are English, the engineers are French, the police German, the lovers Swiss, and it's all run by the Italians."
