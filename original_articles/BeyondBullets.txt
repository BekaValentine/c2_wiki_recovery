No this is not spam it is something which was already here and is in my opinion interesting to discuss. It is based on work done with Microsoft PowerPoint but there is a lot more to it than just that. The main point is the application of ideas of how the human mind absorbs information to the use of presentation media. -- JohnFletcher
