What we look for is often what we find.

The mind is a strong determining factor in producing results

Plenty of research shows this to be the case. The mind is not a general
computing mechanism. It works via attention. If we prime the mind,
say looking for red things, we will be much more efficient at finding
red things.

''Anecdotally I can attest that the mind has the power to influence outcomes.  Essentially, you don't get what you '''want''' but rather what you '''expect'''.  The "MindOverMatter" paradigm is institutionally trite, but careful observation leads to the conclusion that it can't be discounted.''

If you want to more than just vaguely "influence outcomes" and really take command of the situation use the JediMindTrick
