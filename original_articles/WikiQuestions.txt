Sometimes we see unexpected behavior, and can't tell if it reflects a bug, an opportunity for learning, or is just something new for us. Use this page to collect such questions.

'''Q:''' Why is the following link perfectly fine here but broken on my site (which is based on WikiInHyperPerl)? I also tried it out on my PC running ActivePerl build 626 (perl v5.6.1) on Apache 1.3.20 and the same broken link.

I only got up to first ampersand as below.

'''A:''' Testing showed (http://earth.prohosting.com/splina/cgi-bin/splina.cgi?WhereToStayinPerth) that the length of the url is irrelevant. So there is a bug in Ward's code (or some obscure compatibility issue between different versions of perl).

'''Q:''' Why are IP addresses sometimes name-reversed in RecentChanges, and sometimes not?

'''A:''' Answered on the WikiWikiWebFaq.

'''Q:''' The date and time of the previous edit are shown. Is there any way to find out when the edit before that was made, i.e. the date and time of EditCopy? RecentPosts only works for the last CuplaDays, since it comes from the server logs. My understanding is that both versions of a page (current and EditCopy) are saved as complete files, not just a file and a diff, so the information should be available. Editing a page again should kick the EditCopy into the HistoryPages, but the date displayed there seems to be the kick-date, unfortunately. Knowing the date of the EditCopy can be useful, I think, for instance with AbandonedHomePage''''''s on which someone did a spelling correction. -- AalbertTorsius
