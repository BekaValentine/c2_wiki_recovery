SQL Refactor allows you to automatically format your SQL code and database objects in the style of your choice. It also allows you to modify your database easily by providing as of  April 2008 the following refactorings:

* Renames functions, views, stored procedures and tables, and updates all the references to these renamed objects.
* Rename parameters and columns renames parameters of stored procedures and functions, and columns of tables and views.
* Splits a tables into two tables, and automatically rewrites the referencing stored procedures, views, and so on.
* Encapsulate As New Stored Procedure turns your selection into a new stored procedure and, if requested, introduces a reference to it in your script.
* Expand Wildcards expands SELECT * statements to include a full list of columns in the select part.
