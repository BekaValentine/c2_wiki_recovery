Working on my MastersDegree in ComputerScience at StanfordUniversity, after getting a Bachelor at the UniversityOfUtah. After four enjoyable years on the OS Performance team at AppleComputer, I've headed back to get my PhD in ComputerEngineering at a joint program between CarnegieMellon and the UniversityOfPorto.
