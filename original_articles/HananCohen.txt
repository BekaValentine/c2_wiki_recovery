Shalom

I have created a web application called Wikilist.

Wiki List is intended for sharing information that's formatted as ... lists.

It is written in PHP/MySQL.

Wiki List can be downloaded from here http://www.info.org.il/english/wikilist.html

[''You might wish to change 'laid of' in that page to 'laid off'.'']

Come visit.

Thanks.

p.s. It's actually called WikiList, but this wiki already has a page called WikiList so I had to un-capitalize the "L".
