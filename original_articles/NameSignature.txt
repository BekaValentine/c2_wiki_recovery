The NameSignature is the complete information about a function (or method) within a LopLanguage (e.g. ThelopLanguage).
It contains:
	* name (e.g. F''''''ileCpy)
	* parameters (e.g. 2 strings; target file name, source file name)
	* return value (e.g. error status)
	* meaning (e.g. copies the source file to the target file)
There may be
	* examples
	* comments

LOP says that it should be possible to derive the NameSignature of a function by combining the WordSignature''''''s of the words from which the function name is built.

THELOP tries to implement this by
	* defining words, see: ThelopDictionary, ThelopWordExample''''''s
	* defining rules, see: ThelopRule''''''s
