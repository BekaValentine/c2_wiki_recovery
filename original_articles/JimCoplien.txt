You wrote, of "The Language Instinct":
''This is one of five books that I buy in lots because I'm ever giving copies away.'' -- JimCoplien

AnswerMe: May one ask what the other four are? Thanks.

''Jim's stated the whole list somewhere else in Wiki. I know that two are GriefObserved and TheLittlePrince.''

See GreatBooksAboutSoftware for a list that might be the one mentioned. Or perhaps GreatSoftwareBooks?

It's not there. I did a couple of searches and could not find the list in wiki anywhere.

Hi Jim!
During your stay in Brazil for SugarLoafPlop, you gave a talk where you defend the idea the software should be written as many authors would write a collaborative book. I argued that most collaborative writings ''suck''. I believe that Wiki community would like to read about your ideas on it. -- GeraldoXexeo

I believe that Wiki community would like to ''write'' your ideas about it ;-) -- PhilJones
