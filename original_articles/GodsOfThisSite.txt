There are none. We are a consensual community. We don't make Laws or enforce RulesToLiveBy. We have simply grown to respect each other, and thereby we have evolved a set of WikiSocialNorms. 

There are plentiful exceptions to those norms. They justify their existence by containing signal. You may ask yourself WhatIsSignal ... in practice it's the cause of the communal response prevents your edits from being deleted.

Some folk assert that WardCunningham is the god of this site. This is debatable.

Ward can pull the plug on the server, but so many different people possess so many backups of so many different parts of the place, Ward could never truly destroy its content.

Obviously Ward didn't create the content either. More than this, Ward never anticipated the flowers that would bloom from the WikiNature. He simply tied a knot in the web, and let its own tensegrity do the work.

So Ward is not the god of this site. He is the Buddha of this site. And the rest of us are not GodsOfThisSite. We are, at our best, Boddhisatvas of this site ...

''There are none.'' What, not even QwanYin?
