I have since found your earlier page of W''''''ebServicesStandardBodies which I have linked to this page instead. There are other standards related organizations (e.g. OasisOrganization, WebServicesInteroperabilityOrganization), industry groups (e.g. LibertyAlliance) and companies that specialize in consulting for this arena (e.g. ZapThink). You may wish to move the links from here to that page. Your contributions are much valued.
