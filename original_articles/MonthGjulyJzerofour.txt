Horrible example of a WikiDate, representing July 2004 as a WikiWord that sorts correctly.  More elegant approaches sought!  MonthAzeroxEfourxxGjuly would be better for sorting (but not good)

''WikiWord''''''s on this Wiki do not lend themselves readily to numerical or numerically sortable formats.  Luckily, we try to go more for the WikiNow, so it really hasn't been a big issue.''

Not a big issue, I know.  But I've done the WikiNow, kicked the RecentChangesJunkie habit, and sometimes would just like to pick up where I left off.  References to March 25th, 1995 anyone?  [DateJninexFfivexCmarCtwoxxFfivex!!]
