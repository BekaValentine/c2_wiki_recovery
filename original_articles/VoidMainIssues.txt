''The behavior of void main, though seems to be consistent - if main() returns, a "success" code is returned to the process which spawned the program. If exit() or abort() is called, or if an exception handler propagates out of main, those behave in the same way as if main were defined to return an int.''

''VoidMain may be a bit of ugliness in C/C++, but there are things far uglier to be found. -- ScottJohnson''

VM causes destructive thread recidivism on news:comp.lang.c++, due primarily to MicroSoft's usual scoffing at others' standards.

I would hold VoidMain to be a bad idea unless for some reason this particular MainFunction cannot return. Legend has it that some old BSD kernels defined main as void main(void *fp).
