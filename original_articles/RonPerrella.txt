I use the right technology for the right job. That doesn't necessarily imply J2EE, DotNet or anything else. I'm simply not a TechnologyBigot and I won't cram the NewNewThing down a customer's throat.

Though I program primarily in JavaLanguage, KornShell, PhpLanguage, and PerlLanguage, I'm always open to a new experience. Heck, I used to program in LispLanguage, ForthLanguage, RexxLanguage, and AssemblyLanguage!

I like ExtremeProgramming but (naturally) don't agree with everything mentioned. I'm a big believer in PairProgramming which I call "BuddyProgramming".  I'm also a big believer in test scaffolding and built-in UnitTest''''''s.  I do ''not'' believe that large open areas are good for programming. Give me a closed office ''any'' day.

Ron:  I was quite pleasantly surprised to find your response to AlistairCockburn about REXX availability.  Would you happen to know if any of the Linux versions would run under Cygwin?  Thanks, again.  -- HansWobbe.

Well, Hans, I believe that Regina would work just fine under Cygwin.

Thanks Ron.  I've been too busy to try this, but hopefully will get to do so before this month of July ends.  Regards, -- hwo.

I also run a fairly complete Wiki on TextEditor''''''s called http://www.TextEditors.org - it is based on a plain, PERL based Wiki. - RonPerrella
