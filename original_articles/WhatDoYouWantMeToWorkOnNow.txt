''A statement made when a team leader is faced with exhausted funding of one of the projects being worked on - '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20141027

Conversation: (this really did happen)
* Project W, X, Y, and Z Manager: ''We have run out of money on Project X, it needs to be done, but you can't charge any more of your time to the Project X Account''
* Team Leader who is lead on Project W, X and Z: (as he logs-out of project X) ''What do want us to work on now?'' (''Project W, or Project Z, or some other new project'')

The points made in this post:
* ''To illustrate to those who have never encountered something similar, that others have.''
** ''To illustrate RealLife situations encountered, hidden agendas and all that, when a team leader is cheesed off.''
*** http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/learningenglish/language/theenglishwespeak/2014/09/140902_tews_191_cheesed_off.shtml
** ''That sometimes managers who run out of money, instead of getting more money for continuing a work, try to get it done by utilizing resources not paid for by the project receiving the benefits of work done.''
** ''That jobs are terminated or fail, when adequate resources and management are not applied.''
* ''To illustrate that resourceless projects may only be done when resources are made available, or are not withdrawn.''
