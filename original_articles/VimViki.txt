The vim viki[1] plugin adds wiki-like hypertext capabilities to Vim. You can use viki as a "minor" mode (i.e., as an add-on to any other mode) or as a full-fledged wiki mode. There is also an add-on plugin for "wikifying" latex documents by turning some latex commands into wiki names. If viki is properly configured, activating a reference to an image, a webpage etc. will view that resource in an external viewer.

From http://deplate.sf.net you can download a ruby based tool to convert viki markup to html, latex, or docbook.

viki can be classified as PersonalWiki.
