LOLCODE (or LOLcode) is an amusing, new EsotericProgrammingLanguage, so new that its definition is still in the works. Nevertheless, there are a DotNet compiler, PerlLanguage interpreter, PythonLanguage translator, LuaLanguage translator, a JavaScript implementation, and an EclipseIde syntax highlighter for LOLCODE.

Examples at the site show that LOLCODE is an ImperativeLanguage with LoopingConstructs, if/else constructs, try/catch constructs, and file & terminal i/o. Some day it might be suitable for EventDrivenProgramming.

Can't wait to get the ''LOLCODE for Dummies'' book!
