An InappropriateTechnicalObjective is what a manager gives to a developer or a designer to pretend he knows about technical stuff.

It is a manager parade to hide the lack of understanding of technical matters and a way to prove to the line management the manager is still able to manage his staff technically. Very often, the objective in itself is not applicable, irrelevant, or even dangerous or totally absurd.
