I'm a Unix SysAdmin (Solaris, Linux, Openbsd) in New Jersey. 
I'm still trying to unlock the true power of Wiki.
Toward that end, I've installed PikiPiki (yes, love the simple engines) at a couple of sites.
I used to maintain a DokuWiki.

For fun, I race HO-scale slot cars (remember Aurora Model Motoring?) and tinker with old computers.
