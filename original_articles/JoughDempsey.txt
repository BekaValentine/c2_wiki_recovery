'''Q.''' Why does he deserve his own page?

'''A.''' Why not?

For my wiki, please see: the [http://openpoetry.com Open Poetry Project]

Or you could simply link to topics using my InterWiki prefix: OPP
(''providing of course that you use [http://tavi.sourceforge.net 'Tavi] or its ilk'')

You can leave a message for me after the beep (or the <hr>, anyway).
