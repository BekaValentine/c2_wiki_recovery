From the BigOmega page on GreenCheese:

''So what is BigOmega? BigOmega is the limit to all of this. The number bigger than all numbers, ordinal, meta-ordinal or otherwise. The only number bigger than itself, violating all previous set-up rules. Of course, formally, there's no such thing. Its existence violates the OBR, and the meta-OBR, and all the others. Don't think too much about BigOmega. Cantor did, and he became mad.''

BigOmega Î©(n) is also the asymptotic ''lower'' bound of the complexity of an algorithm.

Pshaw. A trifle, this piddling BigOmega. You wouldn't want to be seen with something like ''that''. Why, I've got a BiggerOmega sitting in the lot out behind the dealership:
