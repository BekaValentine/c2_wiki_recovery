Chris La''''''Voie is a student at the University of Iowa (http://uiowa.edu), majoring in Math and Computer Science.  After several semesters of doing Math he is now leaning towards throwing his efforts into Computer Science.  

Chris will be going into his senior year of college at the U of I as of Summer 2004.  

In August 2004 he is to wed Jessica Embach at the Iowa State Memorial Union on August 13th (which happens to be on a Friday).  He met Jessica in his gen-ed creative writing class sophomore year.  They started dating after he invited her to see a play he wrote get performed.  The play is titled "CP I Love U", and is about a computer falling in love with its owner (named Dave).  The actual computer in the performance of the play was an Apple Performa with an old copy of "Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness" in it.  The actor playing Dave owned said computer and donated it to the play for its performance during the annual "Ten Minute Play Festival".  Before that point the actor thought he had lost his Warcraft CD.

'La''''''Voie' is an old French word for "the way" or "the road".  It is not in use any more, but is still a very common French / French-Canadian last name.
