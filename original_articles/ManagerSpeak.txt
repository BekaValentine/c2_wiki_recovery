ManagerSpeak is the variant of NewSpeak adopted by graduates of Business Management programs in higher education.  It tends to fixate on phrases with "quality" in them, and on the removal of any word with negative connotations. Examples: 

* '''problems''': challenges or opportunities 
* '''layoffs''': downsizing or right-sizing 
* '''moving jobs overseas''': globalizing, right-shoring, culture diversification, internationalizing our workforce
