A page on doing ObjectOriented programming in VbClassic (versions up to 6, but not VB.NET, version 7).
VisualBasicDotNet has better features such as true inheritance, but people still have to work with legacy programs.

'''Introduction material'''
* Intro to Com http://www.vbexplorer.com/VBExplorer/wrox/vbcomsamp.asp
* Intro Class programming http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/ShowCode.asp?txtCodeId=47486&lngWId=1
* create strongly typed collections http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnhcvb03/html/vb03l10.asp

A good book on Component Development for VbClassic is ''Developing COM/ActiveX Components with Visual Basic 6'' by Dan Appleman.

I put this book up here as well: ''Visual Basic 6 COM+ Programming Bible'' by John Paul Mueller.

----
AreObjectsComponents, and AreComponentsObjects, are they all very confusing to Mainframe developers having to work with Objects? Not if the ''Object''ive is to stay employed.

''In the case of VbClassic, the objects are always accessed via a particular model, e.g. the ComponentObjectModel (COM). So one could say that the distinction does not actually arise. Of course, the important thing is to define what one means by a "component".''

Another Interesting thing to note is that VbClassic supports SingleThreadedApartment (STA) ComComponent only. http://www.devx.com/vb2themax/Door/18897

Another ComComponent ToughLove example. -- dl

'''ComComponent examples'''

''See three VbClassicSupportForXmlProcessing, XmlRpc and RSS examples '' at http://www.enappsys.com/backend.jsp
* with impressive release notes, install and help, think suitable for beginners

----
'''Applications of Com objects created via VbClassic'''
* ''create Com datasource for CrystalReports.'' see Apr2003 newsletter from http://www.chelseatech.co.nz
* ''COMAddin for VisualBasicForApplications'' http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnovba00/html/Add-insDetail.asp

Suggestions from StevenNewton for beginners in Com technology

The next one looked advanced to me and is C based, but I put it up anyway

Before DotNet days, people started to talk about BusinessObject. One company's view on what that means for VbClassic is described at http://www.asp101.com/articles/visible/vbbizobjprimer/default.asp.
