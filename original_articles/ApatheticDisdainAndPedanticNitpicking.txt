A common reaction when people promote new ideas or propose action.

This reaction can be discouraging.  However, it should be recognized that whenever nobody seriously criticizes an idea, it is either because the idea is basically a good one, or because nobody understands it. If the worst thing critics can say is that you misspelled a few words or didn't use the proper jargon, then you may be on the right track. Lack of vocal enthusiasm from others does not imply lack of support.
