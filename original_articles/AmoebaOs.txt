Amoeba is free distributed OperatingSystem.
It's been developed by AndrewTanenbaum in Vrije Universiteit as a research project in distributed and parallel computing.
Its first prototype was released in 1983 an the last official update was in 1996.
Amoeba has four main goals:
*Distribution: connecting together many machines
*Parallelism: allowing individual jobs to use multiple CPUs easily 
*Transparency: users should not involve with system complexities
*Performance: achieving the three goals above.It's specially done by FLIP (Fast Local Internet Protocol)
