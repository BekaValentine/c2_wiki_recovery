LiveCd is a term coined to describe a bootable cd that will boot up an operating system and usually includes a whole set of applications. The system is completely independent of whatever may exist on the hard drive. This can be nice for experimenting with new operating systems (a number of Linux Live CDs exist) as well as for performing maintenance on an existing system, especially a system that will not boot.
