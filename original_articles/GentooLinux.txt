Gentoo lets you (insists that you?) use their portage program to download the source code and compile your apps, in an easy, automated fashion.  (That's what "ports-based" above means; BSD has "ports", Gentoo has "portage".)  For some people, this just means that it takes longer to install stuff.  For others, it means that each install is tuned to the machine on which it runs.  For still others, it means that if something breaks, they've already got the source on the box, and can UseTheSourceLuke to their heart's content.  --DavidJaquay

For me, it means good-bye to DependencyHell.  Just tell portage what you want, and it gets all the dependencies that I don't have yet.

In the contrary to popular belief, there are also binary packages prepared for use with Gentoo, so one does not have to compile monsters like kde or openoffice on his own box. --R_B

''(insists that you?)'' It doesn't insist anything. Portage is used by default, but it's not forced. Heck, dpkg is in the portage repository.

''MetaDistribution ?''

In part, this means that it can be used to form other distributions, in addition to being usable as-is.  In fact, the Gentoo folks are expanding their portage system to allow apps to be built under MacOsx as well as under Linux.  --DavidJaquay
