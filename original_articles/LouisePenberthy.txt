This is my first trip into a Wiki.  It's an interesting voyage of discovery, but I'm confused.  What ''is'' a Wiki?  It seems to be a multi-user edit-able hypertext -- am I right?

''Here's the definition of a WikiWikiWeb.''

A little bit about me.  I work in Digital Media.  I have been a project manager and interface designer for Web-based application projects.  For this academic year, I'm teaching at Kennesaw State University.  In the spring, I'll be team-teaching a course on Hypermedia.  MarkGuzdial, a researcher at Georgia Tech, mentioned to me that he's been doing research on Wikis.  So I plan to teach something about them in my course in the spring.
