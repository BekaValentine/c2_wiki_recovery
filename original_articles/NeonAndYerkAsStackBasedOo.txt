For an OoEnvironmentForPalm ? I got this update from http://cuiwww.unige.ch/langlist, where it says, "The Language List is an attempt to enumerate all known programming languages. It is maintained by Bill Kinnersley billk@cs.ukans.edu  and is periodically published on comp.lang.misc. This service is provided in collaboration with Software Composition Group, University of Berne."
