I'm a software developer at Progress Software in Bedford, MA. I'm now living in Benbrook, TX but telecommute to Progress machines in California and Massachussets. (Progress acquired my former employer--Persistence Software--based in San Mateo).

I think I came across the PortlandPatternRepository a few years back but didn't grok ''Wiki'' then. I recently came across ExtremeProgramming (backing into it from TestFirstDesign :-)) and '''Wiki''' was there again!

I got TheWikiWay and am trying to get other developers in my company to use a wiki for discussing process issues. But if I take '''Wiki''' to the eXtreme, does that mean we all have to have our own wikis?  ''Yes!! See PersonalWiki.''

OK. After playing around with several WikiWikiClone''''''s, I've put in a UseMod:UseModWiki for work even though it seems a bit broken in handling mixed numbered vs. bulleted items. ''TheWikiWay handled that pretty well, but didn't have diff support''

Of course, getting people to '''use''' it is another issue. Not a BuildItAndTheyWillCome situation. :-)
