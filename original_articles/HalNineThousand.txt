The name is derived from IBM by shifting the three letters one place upwards in the alphabet. 

HAL can control all technical elements of a SpaceShip, kill whomsoever including humans by those means, see everything inside, speak to humans about everything, have an agenda, and can read lips if cut of from the sound of a compartment. But HAL is not a RepliCant.
