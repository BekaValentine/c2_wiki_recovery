This page discusses various contemporary educational techniques commonly used by computer science professors. 

	*Book Reading - This is where a professor will read you a book for 1 hour a day, several days a week for an entire semester. You touchingly recall when your mom used to read you bed time stories.

	*The Duality Rule - In this case, the professor will operate on two mutually exclusive levels:

		1. Lectures

		1. Assignments

	*The Proxy Method - This is an administrative technique in which students are taught by other students (usually foreign grad students). These courses are often challenging, both linguistically and emotionally.

	*The Discussion Method - This is where students stare blankly at each other while the professor asks them to discuss the material "they read last night."

	*The Lab Method - This is where professors make the labs so hard that they have as much extra credit labs as regular labs and the brightest student in the class gets a 174% in the class while about a quarter of the class actually shows up for lab and really does them at 5 am the day before they're due.

	*My preferred method of education is that of full immersion into a computer driven learning system which is able to push the student only if he/she is able to comprehend the material and provide active feedback. The "system" would consist of the following main components.

		1. Computer
		1. Large touchscreen plasma monitors 
		1. interactive web tablet (wireless)
		1. complex interactive software
		1. nation database to update course material
