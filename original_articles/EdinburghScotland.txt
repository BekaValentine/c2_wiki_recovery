''pronounced 'Embra' in local parlance, not 'Edin-bo-ro'. --AlanFrancis''

AlanFrancis saves Americans from looking stupid.   Okay, not looking stupid is perhaps too big a job for one wiki... --AnonymousDonor 

Kent, if that's you, I thought you'd have realised after Sardinia that Scots live for the chance to make Americans look stupid.  It's actually pronounced "Throat-Wobbler-Mangrove", I just wanted the yanks to look dumb saying "Embra" :-) --AlanFrancis  ''You're a very silly man and I'm not going to interview you!''

British toponyms are notorious traps for the uninitiated. Leicester is my personal favorite.

... And also a haven of peurile humour... I work near a place called Haseley Nob, which sounds like a particularly nasty affliction. And you'll ''never'' guess what the local graffiti artists did to the signs pointing to Snitterfield. -- JayBell

I used to live in an area of Coventry called "Cheylesmore". Some people pronounce it "Chay-als-more" like it's spelled. Some people pronounce it "Charles' Moor".. the next area round is called Styvechale, and pretty much anything starting with an S is considered a viable attempt at pronouncing it..

Hey I live in Coventry!   But toponyms get more fun further South.... Towcester ("toaster") and Bicester  ("bister") confused me ... and oddly-named villages in the Cotswolds.  BillWeston
