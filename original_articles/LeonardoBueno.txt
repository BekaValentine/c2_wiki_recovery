I'm trying ExtremeProgramming, for the first time, at TheMarbleProject. I've being reading extremeprogramming@yahoogroups.com.br for more than 6 months and I've read almost everything in Wiki about ExtremeProgramming.

In my previous job, I worked for a company who used an instance of RUP with some ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices: CodingStandard''''''s, ContinuousIntegration and UnitTest''''''s. Simple design (DoSimpleThings, YouArentGonnaNeedIt, OnceAndOnlyOnce, SimplifyVigorously) was applied in a programmer by programmer basis.

I can be reached at mailto:leonardo@itera.com.br.
