Since I'm very interested in XML, I created this category. Click into the title to see all the pages related to XML.

Some links to get you started on XML are at http://moin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xml/moin/XmlLinks (BrokenLink 20100909) 

See also XmlPattern and XmlSchemaPatterns RelaxNgSchemaPatterns, SchematronSchemaPatterns.

'''Wikis about XML'''

* XML wiki: http://moin.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xml/moin/FrontPage

'''Wikis that use XML internally'''

* AxKitXspWiki -- a wiki written using AxKit. Pages may be edited in WikiText (currently broken), POD (Perl documentation) or custom XML using stylesheets. For example, here's a wiki page written using a custom schema (an "person" entity) and XSLT stylesheets: http://crew.ccs.neu.edu/wiki/CrewPeople -- IanLangworth

* OpenWiki -- http://www.openwiki.com -- XML/XSL architecture. ASP code. Excellent tool. I'm using it at work right now, and love it. My only gripe is I can't get co-workers to understand the WikiEssence and start using the damn thing! :(  -- DaveCantrell

* OpenWiki -- I'm using OpenWiki too at http://www.jediwars.com/lotr for a Lord of the Rings Wiki. Reformating for XSL is a snap, and love the subpaging and dbl-click-to-edit features. Also multiple choices for backend databases was refreshing. -- BryceNielsen

* PerspectiveWiki -- XML/XSLT with WYSIWYG editing across multiple browsers. Incoming messy HTML from browsers is normalised into an XML form for storage.
