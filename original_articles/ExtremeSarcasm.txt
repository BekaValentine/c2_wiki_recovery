ForExample:

ExtremeProgramming --- isn't that what they used on the failed
ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation project? (see CthreeProjectTerminated) ''That's "cancelled", not "failed"''
(there's a difference in a page called ExtremeSarcasm?)

I know I shouldn't have written this example, but I couldn't resist it.
MeaCulpa, MeaCulpa, MeaMaximaCulpa.

See BrutalSarcasm, HaHaOnlySerious, and IronyGulf, especially them cultural notes.

------

ExtremeSarcasm can probably only exist where the same, or similar, 'problem' crops up again and again.  As similar issues turn up the sarcasm gradually becomes more elaborate and (possibly) subtle.

An example based on a crackpot scheme:

Time 1:

"Hmmm - what a *wonderful* solution"

Time 2:

"This seems almost as good an idea as the [project that failed in a HorriblyHairy way] project. Lets do it!"

Time 3:

etc..

''Yes, we tried that at ChapterElevenDotCom.''
