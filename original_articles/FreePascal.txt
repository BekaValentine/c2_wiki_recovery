Free Pascal (once known as FPK Pascal) is an OpenSource 32 bit PascalLanguage (ObjectPascal) compiler and IDE (LazarusIde).

It is available for many processors: Intel x86, Motorola 680x0 (1.0.x only), PowerPc (from 1.9.2), SPARC, and ARM. The following operating systems are supported: LinuxOs, FreeBsd, NetBsd, MacOsx/Darwin, MacOsClassic, MsDos, Win32 (MicrosoftWindowsApi), OS/2 (IbmOsTwo), BeOs, SunSolaris, QNX (QnxOs) and Classic AmigaDos.

Free Pascal supports both BorlandDelphi and TurboPascal style object systems and also has ported most of their class libraries.  Much TurboPascal code will run unmodified under Free Pascal, even down to the {$...} compiler pragmas.

Version 2.0 was released in May 2005.  It is a substantial refactoring, allowing greater code optimization and making it easier to target other platforms.
