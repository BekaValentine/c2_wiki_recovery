Better known expanded name for Windows '''DNA'''. Also see note at the end of this page

An implementation framework, now superseded by 2002 MicrosoftDotNet, proposed in 1999 by Microsoft for a one-stop solution for all computing needs for medium to larger Enterprises. 

It was aimed at the market segment that traditionally deployed mainframe based solutions, and at the same time designed to check the growing influence of the SunJava consortium, who have championed the EnterpriseJavaBeans alternative to Mainframe Computing.

Key technology and Components include:
* TCP/IP based networking
* Thin client Web GUI based frontend served by ASP
* XML messaging, evolving to SOAP
* UniversalDataAccess
* COM+ to provide transaction and security services for server based COM objects

WindowsTwoThousand, especially the server version, is the flagship product that provides the means to implement this all Microsoft solution. Another key product, BizTalk, only made available much later.

COM+ (ComPlus) is the revamped MicrosoftTransactionServer (MTS) that provided message queuing and event model on top of the ComponentObjectModel (COM). COM objects have been around for years before DNA from MicroSoft, and it is an example of implementation of InterfaceBasedProgramming. An article somewhere described VisualBasic, now called VbClassic, as the GUI version of a COM programming tool. Perhaps the ease of creating COM objects by VbClassic contributed to its popularity. The Internet enabled version of COM object is called Activex, which has been taken out from the web/server scene after MicrosoftDotNet came out as the DNA replacement framework.

----
Although MicrosoftCorporation has been withdrawing material about DNA since early days of DotNet, many key component technologies within this architecture are expected to stay useful till WindowsLonghorn becomes a reality, and at mid 2004 that date is 2007 the earliest. 

And the MicrosoftIndigo component of the next windows may not arrive until the server version of WindowsLonghorn, and until then ComPlus will be used by DotNet for transaction services.

Found a good description of this still on MS site in mid 2004, at http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/technologies/iis/deploy/projplan/componen.mspx

The article is actually chapter 13 taken from book ''Professional Active Server Pages 3.0'', and go by the name of ''Components and Web Application Architecture''.

Check it out before it is forever gone.

Microsoft has a paper on the ''...lessons learned from building N-tier Applications using Microsoft Windows DNA''. It contrasts DNA with DotNet setups

'''Additional note on the full name'''

The official name was ''Distributed interNet Application Architecture''. However when doing a Google search 'Distributed Internet Architecture' came up with more relevant match than 'Distributed Internet Application'.
