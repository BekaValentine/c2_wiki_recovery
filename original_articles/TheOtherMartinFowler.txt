Whenever I tell Brits they should read something relevant by MartinFowler, I tend to get howls of laughter... then I have to say, "no, there's another MartinFowler".

Here's a link to the one most Brits know about: 

http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/characters/character_content/character_martin_f.shtml

He's a bit younger than the real MartinFowler, and this lad knows more about teen crime than he does about refactoring.

''[Same problem with MichaelJackson vs the Michael Jackson Who Sang Bad.]''

''[Same problem with RobinWilliams vs RobinWilliamsTheActor.]''

''most Brits know about'' - BritishCulturalAssumption. Some of us GaveUpOnTelevision or never even watched soap operas in the first place. Reading TheOtherMartinFowler only provoked a blank stare from me.

So you aren't "most Brits" then?

[Is it another BritishCulturalAssumption that Eastenders isn't in global syndication?]

I saw Eastenders on TV during the summer of 2004 in Seattle, WA, so it probablly is on global syndication. I just wonder what americans make of it.
