I'm building a data store. I want it to have these properties:

* No SinglePointOfFailure. If any single hard drive or other thing fails, users never even notice -- can still read and write files as always.
* "hot repair" -- a technician can fix any single failure without taking the system offline.
* "hot testing" -- I can confirm all the data is properly backed up, without risking overwriting the current "live" data with old "backup" data, and users can still read and write files as always during the test.

Surely I'm not the only person in the world that wants something like this.
A few of the people I mention this to claim "All businesses big enough to have an IT department already have something like this".
But when I ask "If such a system already really exists, where can I buy one (BuyDontBuild)?", no one seems to know.

If such a system doesn't yet exist, perhaps I'll not only build one for me, but start selling it to other people ...

'''"making stuff smaller"'''

DavidCary has programmed several EmbeddedSystem''''''s with little RAM, no hard drive, and anemic processors.
This leads to an interest in "making stuff smaller".

I am porting ForthLanguage to a microcontroller with 256 Bytes (that would be 0.256 kiloBytes) of RAM.
I suppose
http://forthfreak.net/index.cgi?DavidCary
would be a more appropriate forum to discuss it.

With little RAM, it would be nice to have a "space-optimizing compiler".
Perhaps CategoryDuplicationFindingTool could help?

'''programming languages'''

DavidCary has programmed in over two handfuls of computer "languages", and is trying to become fluent in 3 natural languages. This leads to an interest in

.

My Pascal teacher taught us to draw Nassi-Shneiderman flowcharts, and in another class I wrote a very crude prototype of piece of software to let users draw Nassi-Shneiderman flowcharts. Later I *almost* learned LabView. This and my interest in learning new programming languages leads to an interest in 
NassiShneidermanDiagrams
LiterateProgramming
VisualLanguage VisualProgramming VisualProgrammingLanguage GraphicalProgrammingLanguage
(MentalShorthand?).

I even became the First Editor of the Visual Wiki http://visual.wiki.taoriver.net/ .

I discovered HyperCard and UseNet in college, so I was already pre-primed to understand the WWW when it came out. (I suppose you can get a pretty good estimate of my age from that fact.)

(Then I went and created the RemoteStrangulationProtocol. Sigh.)

The day after I read IndexCard on Ward's Wiki, I bought a stack of 3x5 IndexCard''''''s. ShopForIndexCards.
I find BuckminsterFuller (the person, or rather, the books he's written, not the WikiPage) very inspiring.
I've built a few Platonic solids out of IndexCard''''''s.
And I've started carrying around a HipTop as described on the

'''To do'''

Todo: refactor
GeographyExample
HexGridIcosahedron
HexGridSphere
HexGridDisk
to put "non-intuitive / common mistakes" up front. There seems to be a lot of redundancy on these pages; should I combine them and then break them back apart? Perhaps SphereTiling and squares_vs_triangles_vs_hexagons?
(2004-08-30: I created WithoutCause)

Todo: run the test at BetterForLoopConstruct on my machine.

Todo: read ChangeYourOrganizationDiary

Todo: 
compile the code at
http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LanguageLawyerRequired
and see what my GCC compiler produces.

''I just made that up on-the-spot for ProgrammableCalculators - I don't remember ever hearing that idea before. I extrapolated the idea of handheld devices having more and more ability.

Good stuff you did on the PowerTrip page, may I suggest adding NotInventedHere as an example of "Behavioral aspects" section entry? I do not want to change it myself to take away the QuickDiff credit that is yours.

One thing you scientists can help solve one of my queries. Years ago I saw lots of "solar powered" calculators, and decades ago we have watches that were "human motion powered". Do we not have enough energy to harness through these and other sources to keep a SmartPhone running? Or is it the economics (energy still too cheap) that have prevented resurgence of such "alternate energy" solutions?

''Good question. Does this article answer your question?:

''"On 'Dick Tracy' Time"'' by Junko Yoshida, 2004-11-01
http://www.eetimes.com/consumer/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=51200433
" A typical watch, which can run without interruption for three years, needs only 1 milliamp; a cell phone integrated with DSP and RF capabilities needs at least 150 mA."

I think this 150 mA is in the receiver, which must be constantly turned on (otherwise it wouldn't know to ring when someone called you).
3 years times (1 mA / 150 mA) is about 7 days.

Hey Dave!

My name is Marcus and I noticed that you were looking for a Hackerspace in Tulsa. I started an electronics club last year, but now we need a place to meet. So the time is nigh, that we pool together some resources and start a hackerspace!

The only internet safe way to give you my contact information (that I can think of at the moment) is facebook. You can find me there under my full name Marcus Gaskamp.

I hope to talk to you soon!

Hey Marcus.
I hope to talk to you soon.
Do Tulsa electronics enthusiasts have a web site like http://geeksok.com/ ?
I would like to set up a wiki for Tulsa electronics enthusiasts, if you don't have one already.
My telephone number is on my resume at http://david.carybros.com/html/resume.html .
