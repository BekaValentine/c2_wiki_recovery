Languages which appeal more to corporate management than to "guru" programmers. Corporate languages tend to be statically-typed, and lack features such as closures, lambda's, etc. This is possibly because they target "average" programmers rather than higher-end programmers. Also, static typing gives one the feeling/illusion (depending on your stance) of machine checking.

Surely Eiffel isn't a corporate language? It fits the rest of the definition, but for some reason has never got its foot in the corporate door to the extent of the others on the list. I'd suggest removing Eiffel and adding VisualBasic. -- BrianCooke
