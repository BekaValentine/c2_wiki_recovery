Phonetic alphabets usually refer to alphabets with special characters with a single pronunciation in order to indicate in dictionaries, and other documents, how to pronounce words.

Phonetic alphabet is the name also used when referring to alphabets containing an internationally recognized words for each letter of an alphabet used by operators to remove ambiguity when spelling words.  These were particularly used during historical wars and by telephone operators when communication equipment was of a poor quality.

Here follows various phonetic alphabets for English.
