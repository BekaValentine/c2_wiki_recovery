I'm an avid web application programmer, who first discovered computers at age 5, and for the next 18 years never stopped using them. I have been a longtime reader of Wikis and WikiLikeThing''''''s including Everything2, Wikipedia, Meatball and last but most enjoyable WikiWikiWeb. I love reading about and pondering the sciences of WebCommunityBuilding and CollaborativeSoftware.

I've been developing my own WikiLikeEngine WikiCms lately, although have been toying with the idea of forking it into a 2nd project called WikiAuthor (or something else), because I seem to have 2 distinct ideas in my head on the subject.

My longest running personal project has been AutoCoder (which I'm considering renaming to the more descriptive UniversalDataInterface), which is a set of php scripts which is capable of providing a user interface for any MySQL database in existence. It provides multiple user logins and groups (which represent MySQL users and permissions) the ability to search, list, edit, add, delete, and report upon records in many tables with any type of Relationship. The configuration is designed to be very simple, requiring less than an hour of an administrator's time to provide a user interface for a massive, multi-table pre-existing RelationalDatabase.

I'm fluent in php, ASP, JavaScript, ColdFusion, perl, and C. I work as a ColdFusion application developer for the Intranets and Internets of various hospitals. I also have my own FreeBSD server, on which I host various AdultSites and the sites of my friends, it is located at http://www.pr0nserver.com. I also spend some time pleading my friends to program with me, or check out whatever WebApp I've built recently. (http://www.erbst.org/lines.php is my most recent)

Outside of computer science, my interests include HouseMusic, HarmReduction, my cats and my significant other.

My home page is http://www.erbst.org and my projects are currently located at http://www.autocoder.org and http://www.wikicms.com/docs/

''Autocoder sounds like a rather unusual project; I'll have to look into what you've done.''
