Why not sign your name like this -- isn't it more stylish? ~ WaldenMathews

I kinda like that, but Ward has a semi-official standard of space-double-dash-space. -- LikeThis

''double-dash-space, of course, is the standard signature separator in email.''

plus, we wouldn't want to suffer the same fate when the squatter sends down the troopers.

	''Monkey. see: Monkey do. "Standard Shmandard." No "buts" about it. Do what you want to do.''

A tilde is often used in a filename to indicate a temporary or backup file, so count me in favour of the Tilde''''''Sig ''temporarily''.<-~-~~ CarstenKlapp


I use both. Perhaps a standard will evolve where
	*  --WikiName  is for serious comments.
	* ~WikiName is for quips, OffTopic comments, and anything the author feels is transitory in nature. It sure is easier than putting OpenAuthor after each sig.

The tilde can be used to mean "approximately", as in "pi ~= 4" (For sufficiently small values of 4 :-)

It is also standard unix shorthand for a home directory.

The tilde also combines with an n in Spanish to form the "''eñe''", as in "''Mañana''". But can the ñ be used in a WikiÑame? HastaMañana?  Sadly, no, it can't. 

I like it better for a short sig. Not so much for a long one. ~ Pete
