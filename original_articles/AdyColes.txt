Well, I've been using the information on these pages for quite some time. I thought it was about time to come out into the open, so to speak.

My interests are ComponentBasedDevelopment (CBD), ComponentBasedProgramming, the Software management process & development life-cycle, DesignPatterns, ProcessPatterns & poetry (OnlinePoetry).

I've a book of poetry published - "Getting it out of my system" (ISBN: 1-85863-428-8 ''amazon.co.uk only''), or visit http://www.theivorytower.org.uk/poetry/ for more recent efforts.
