Many discussions on Wiki are like the archtypical superhero battle, where dialog as to the powers and abilities of each side are exchanged during battle.


Example:
My opinion is such and such ...

''My opinion is the exact opposite here's why ...''

Well I invented the internet and etc etc

''I discovered the GeneticCode and i'm right because blah blah''

...

Your AdHominem cannot harm me: my wings are like a shield of steel! (BatFink)

Till one or the other gives up.
