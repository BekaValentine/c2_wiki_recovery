Also known as DataOrientedProgramming.

An alternative programming methodology. It gets from RecordTypes to objects not by adding methods, but by adding handlers to the variables. I.e. the only 'slots' of an object are still variables, but arbitrary (chains of) methods, that are called on-access can be attached to these variables. Advanced systems will have apriori, validation and post assignment handling of the slots. 

One commercial application of Access Oriented Programming was the graphical user interface builder ViewSoft Internet. Unfortunately, the software is no longer available.

I remember having read about it in some IEEE journal, but cannot find the original article, though google 'access-oriented-programming' turns up some references. ''Found: Stefik, M., Bobrow, D.G., and Kahn, K. "Integrating access-oriented programming into a multiparadigm environment" (1986) IEEE Software 3(1)January 1986''

''Sounds to me like a MetaObjectProtocol of some sort.''

Ahh, yes, and no. You could implement it with an MOP, but on the other hand, you could implement classes with it too. But I think it ''is'' a kind of specialized MOP. .gz
