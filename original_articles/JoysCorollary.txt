The code generation rate of a development group is a linear function of the number of developers, while the idea generation rate is exponential. The ratio, ''i.e.'' productivity, therefore approaches zero.

And I thought, the idea generation rate was quadratic, because the communication possible/required is quadratic. At least, I don't think that it is exponential.

But the productivity approaches zero anyway :-)

''It could be exponential because the ideas may come as '''2^n''', being the number of ways you can get a sub-collection of developers.''

Remember that not all idea generators are developers, some aren't even employers.

Can you buy an Idea''''''Generator at Amazon? I want one!

''Sure. It's called a "book". ;-)''
