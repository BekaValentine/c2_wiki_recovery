"Create, Read, Update, and Delete" ("CRUD") = the four basic operations on a database record.  Also, an application which provides only a thin interface over database operations.

From an SQL relational database perspective, "SelectInsertUpdateDelete."

Some tools and frameworks will automatically generate CrudScreen''''''s for you -- AutoGenCrudScreens.

"CRUD" is not descriptive enough in my opinion. I'd instead suggest "SER":
* Search
* Edit - Includes add, change, and delete
* Report

''Furtherless, despite all the tutorials teach CRUD, industrial-strength programs often should never Update or Delete. To Update, you add a new record, with a timestamp, that adjusts a previous record. To Read, you look thru a View of some type that rolls up all this auditing trail. And, naturally, you only mark for deletion.''

''That is the only way to preserve consistent auditing and accountability across mistakes and revisions.''
