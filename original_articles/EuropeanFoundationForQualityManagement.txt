An industry body endorsed by the European Union, the EFQM seeks to promote a version of TotalQualityManagement throughout the EU. The EFQM maintains an ExcellenceModel against which companies may be audited.

EFQM assessment differs from IsoNineThousand accreditation since it is a measure, not a boolean, and since it asks whether or not your processes are ''any good'', as measured by the satisfaction of your stakeholders: managers, employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and, ultimately, the general public.
