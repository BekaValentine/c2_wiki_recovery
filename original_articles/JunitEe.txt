JUnitEE is free software for unit testing in a J2EE ( JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition ) environment.

http://www.junitee.org includes a tutorial.

You might also want to look at http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/. It's significantly more complicated, but it makes the HTTP servlet objects available to your test case.
----

JakartaCactus is useful for automated testing during the builds and JUnitEE is useful for manual testing.  I think both are good to have in your J2EE development toolkit.

From the JakartaCactus web page, Cactus is for Integration Unit Testing.
----
JUnitEE allows you to run your unit tests from a servlet on an app server.  To put it simply, it adds an additional TestRunner (HTML or XML) to the AWT, Swing, and command line test available with JUnit.  Thus it is similar, to JakartaCactus in that it provides Integration Unit Testing.

HttpUnit, available at http://www.httpunit.org, is more complicated, and provides support for testing the View layer.  According to the JakartaCactus web site it is considered "functional unit testing".  Like JUnitEE, it can be integrated with JakartaCactus.

See the JakartaCactus web page for some good diagrams and detail on the differences between JUnitEe , HttpUnit, and JakartaCactus.

Should JUnitEE be considered obsolete software? In other words, does it work with Java EE 5 and support its new features? And is it still being developed? / Kent

----
Somehow there is nothing more annoying than an is it obsolete question, as in IsJavaDead ?  Besides the issue that the question to me is not very relevant as you should really be asking if your tests are obsolete.  JUnitEE is simply a thin wrapper around JUnit that allows you to execute your unit tests in a container.  Anyway, to answer your question, taking a look at the project page, there is a recent release that adds support for JUnit 4.x.
