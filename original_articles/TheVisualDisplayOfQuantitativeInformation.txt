Now I remember where I got the hint. Ordered EdwardTufte's next book EnvisioningInformation, had to wait a very long time for it, and loved it. Not only an interesting, but before all a beautiful book. This seems like a good place to share reviews. See StayingCurrent. -- MartineDevos

The best piece of advice I got from this book was to take a graph, then erase everything you can without removing any of the underlying information. Tufte illustrates this exercise with a very clever looking graph (the kind you might get out of Excel) that turns into a simple and elegant graph. The best part of it was that the original graph had a grid printed under the data. Erasing the horizontal lines in the grid left little spaces in the vertical grid lines that reminded you of the values of the y axis, but very subtly and without intruding on the information. -- KentBeck

One of the more beautiful books you'll ever hold in your hands; Tufte took out a second mortgage on his house in order to self-publish the book according to his own standards for production. Now that's dedication! -- BetsyHanesPerry

I hate 3D pie charts. By definition and design, they distort the data. The whole point of doing a pie chart is to make the relative sizes easy to see. The primary result of tilting the chart and making it "thick" is to distort the data. -- JeffGrigg

''Pie charts are still bad because most people don't perceive the X and Y axes as equal. A small slice in one direction is often judged to be a different size from an identical slice in another.''
