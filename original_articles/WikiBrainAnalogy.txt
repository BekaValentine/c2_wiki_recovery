I was just noticing that this Wiki structure is an awful lot like how science believes the brain forms new connections.

I was also wondering if it was all as simple as it sounds.

* so far
* so good
** and even better...
At least as far as it goes ;)

And if a thought should wander ...

I do not really understand what is analogous to what in this analogy. Could you elaborate? (Ah, I'm ArguingWithGhosts, last edit November 11, 2004) - and why does Wiki think that I wrote all of this?
