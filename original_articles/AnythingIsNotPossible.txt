In contrast to AnythingIsPossible, not everything is possible. It's not possible for a human to run 100 meters in 0.0001 second.

Sorry sir. Pigs cannot fly. That's a fact.

A DevilsAdvocate would argue that you could make a pig fly by genetically modifying it (adding massive wings and making the bones hollow for weight savings). This is likely true; however you would develop a new animal that is no longer a pig, it would be a bird like animal with some pig qualities.

Of course pigs can fly, they can get through airport security pretty easily, too.  Now if you meant flying under their own power...

''This is another example of TwistingWords... they can fly on airplanes first class and order peanuts and other snacks... but they can't fly themselves like a bird can..''
