Whenever I analyze and design, I ask the user what he does the most frequently. The process that user does most frequently is to be automated first. Then next frequently etc. And I find that it applies to every other aspects of software design.
	* Automate most frequently executed process.
	* Make efficient implementation of most frequently used code.
	* Make it easier for the user to use most frequently used functionality.
	* Provide flexibility and simplicity to the most frequently used code.
	* Standardize most frequently used protocol.
	* etc.

So, put maximum efforts where it is used most frequently.
