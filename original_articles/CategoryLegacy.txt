EditHint: Requesting permission to create CategoryLegacy.

Comments? 

''Permission is not needed to create a category. People will comment if they think it does not make sense. What is needed is sufficient pages to make it worthwhile having it. Say a minimum of 10 but that is just my opinion.'' -- JohnFletcher

Maybe CategoryHistory is "close enough". There is also CategoryWikiHistory as well and even CategoryComputingHistory.

''Sometimes it is good to have some related ones with links to each other. Anyone who comes across one will find the other one too.''

I'd lean toward a smaller set of categories. Although, I wish this wiki had a "synonym engine".
