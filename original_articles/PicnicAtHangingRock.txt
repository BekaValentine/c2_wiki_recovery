1970s Australian cultural renaissance flick starring a host of lovely young things most particularly the young Anne Lambert. One notably aged wikizen is lucky enough to still possess several neurons containing the image of the young Lambert's first nude scene in the classic Australian soapsploitation TV series, ''Number 96''. And then to have seen her on Sydney streets in her only slightly faded forties. Some women are born to haunt men's minds. ''Sigh.''

The score of this film is only slightly less haunting.
