SimpleMinded solution to Success: 

* Know what is to be accomplished. 
* Make sure that adequate resources are available to accomplish each known task.
* If resources do not seem to be available, AskQuestions.
* If no one at the level of request answers to the request by providing the necessary resources, either remove the task from your list of what is to be accomplished, or escalate the request to a higher level.
* If resources are made available, apply resources where they fit requirements..
* Repeat

Do not forget to let everyone know your successes as soon as they occur. This is important to avoid being fired because you have not achieved what you were supposed to do.

Success is not something that happens on your mind, it is something that happens on everyone's mind at the same time.
