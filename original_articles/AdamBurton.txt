I really enjoy returning to WikiWikiWeb occasionally to see what is happening. It has been a long time since I have had a good look around. I have not succeeded in learning the programming languages that I would like to learn however hopefully I will slowly get to grips with them.

I want to apply what I am slowly beginning to learn about web programming to my web site - http://adamburton.com/ - which is evolving into a hopefully confusing enough state for people to become immersed/lost in it for some time as one can with WikiWikiWeb and Wikipedia et cetera but with images and writing about nothing in particular. A useless resource.

Never mind.
