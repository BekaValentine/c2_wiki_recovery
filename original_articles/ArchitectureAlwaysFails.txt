In any large organization, perception is more important than reality. If a Software Architect is not good at creating the perception of value by doing architecture, this effort always fails.

Most often, Software Architects are senior developers pushed into this role. They lack the necessary political skills to create this perception in an organization. Typical software organizations are reactive in nature, and they live by releases and current customers. In a reactive environment, it is nearly impossible to create value for using architecture. Architecture in a typical company is always doomed to fail.

We in software need to be more politically savvy. Architecture must be reframed
in some critical customer requirements. You will get nowhere saying this will make the
product better. Nobody gives a frig. Instead, figure out how to attach it
as a rider to another requirement.

The problem though, I'm guessing, is that the architecture is probably poor and won't work anyway.

Architecture is not easily measurable or quantifiable in numbers. You can not really attach a dollar figure to architecture benefits. 

So, its a hard task. If you are a sr developer and is considering to becoming an architect, be aware that it may waste your valuable time in terms of career growth.
