If you were to sample the areas in which the readers and writers on this wiki are expert, you would find a broad representation of disciplines and levels of expertise. In making this wiki a better place and to ChangeTheCommunity of people making new contributions and to modify pages, We should encourage and support those who would RaiseTheWikiPagePotential. If you have something to say or add, you should ContributePagesFromYourExpertise.

While this wiki is not intended to be an authoritative source of information, the content is generally fairly reliable and accurate. This will be particularly so if those who are experts in their field, but otherwise somewhat reluctant to make contributions, are encouraged and reinforced to do so.  

If you consider yourself to be an expert in an area of computing and programming, or have had good success in applying your skill in projects and patterns of software and management, try your hand in composing the beginning of a page on a topic which you think might interest readers of this wiki.

Your experience might be somewhat like mine. Several years ago, I composed my first page, and immediately was confronted with comments which made me rethink what was in, and how I presented the topic. There is probably no other way to become a wiki contributor that to make your first steps, however haltingly in the process of creating content.  You will need to do so with the realization that others do not understand or phrase things quite the way you do, and you will need to factor this consideration into how you present and modify your page.

Put your feelings aside, and realize you are not presenting "your version", but what can become a "community version" of the topic.
