More realistic version of DoItRightTheFirstTime. Incompatible with IfItWorksItIsOk.

The core of iterative development.

XP covers this with OnceAndOnlyOnce, UnitTest''''''s and AcceptanceTest''''''s ('do it right'). Also YouArentGonnaNeedIt ('this time') is meant to help to DoItRightThisTime. Each iteration develops a system that is fit for its current niche (requirements). As the niche changes the system evolves (iterates).

Hopefully this will lead to an EmergentArchitecture.



Also a conversational AntiPattern, as in, "We're sure to get it right this time!"

I know too many people who want to do it right, but they want to do that next time.  There is no next time.
