
You would like to AdoptPairProgramming, but management doesn't believe you when you tell them all of its benefits.

'''Therefore,'''

Bring out the research and present it to them. (Tips on this?) See PairProgrammingCostsBenefits for sources.

'''Evidence/Examples'''

''(none so far)''

'''Discussion'''

I'm currently trying this out at my job. The manager is already keen on some form of pairing (he calls it shadowing), so I don't know if this will be good support for the ProtoPattern. -- RH
