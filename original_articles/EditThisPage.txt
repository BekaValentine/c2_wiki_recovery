<http://www.EditThisPage.com> one of the domain names acquired by UserLand for their free web hosting services that showcases ( and stress tests ) the ManilaInterface web sites from their Scriptable ObjectDatabase product UserlandFrontier. Using either a web browser RadioUserland  to access <http://EditThisPage.com/ > and signing up as a member the ManilaInterface lets the member choose a new machine name for their web site that will be created inside the EditThisPage domain. 

Each web created supports the Authentication concepts of Public, Member, Contributing Editors and Managing Editors ( creator ) with preferences set by the Managing Editors on the Authorities for the site. Any page you are allowed to edit sprouts an EditThisPage button [ hence the domain name ] and allows the body text of the web document message to be edited in the clients web browser or in their local copy of Frontier or Radio.

Userland launched the Manila EditThisPage hosting service in December 1999 and by  March 1st 2000 had over 3,000 sites; with ThePlan to be hosting 10,000 sites by June.

Frontier creates a new independent FrontierObjectDatabase for the member based on the members identity so that the machine name of their site ( and their entire web ) can be changed at whim.
