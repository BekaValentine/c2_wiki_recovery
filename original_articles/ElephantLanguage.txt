'''Elephant 2000: A Programming Language Based on Speech Acts'''

''I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful, one hundred percent!'' 

''moreover, ''

''An elephant never forgets!''

Elephant 2000 is a computer programming language (CategoryProgrammingLanguage), apparently named because it can refer to past events:
"Elephant source programs may not need data structures, because they can refer directly to the past. Thus a program can say that an airline passenger has a reservation if he has made one and hasn't cancelled it."
(Is it theoretical, or has it ever been implemented ?)

Elephant's Memory is something completely different -- a ConLang intended for human-to-human communication (CategoryNaturalLanguage).
