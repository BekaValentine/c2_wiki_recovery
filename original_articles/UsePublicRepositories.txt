WikiStub

A key principle suggested for adapting ExtremeProgramming to OpenSourceCulture.

Some popular code repositories:

* GitHub
* SourceForge
* BitBucket

WikiStub:

Make and keep a '''development''' branch and '''release''' branch.

The development branch can hold commits that don't pass their tests. The release branch should only hold code that has passed all its tests. A mailing list or issues tracker should at all times hold all current coding trajectories so people can know what team to join.

Those who want to do more design or ReFactoring, checkout from the release branch. Those who want to code, see the development branch. Merging will have to be coordinated at unpredictable intervals.

To stay consistent, with regard to licensing:  Use the GnuPublicLicense for '''code'''; for the content people make using your code, use CreativeCommons (Attribution, ShareAlike).
