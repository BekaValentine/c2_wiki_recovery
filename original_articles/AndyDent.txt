Software developer in Perth, Western Australia with a very very wide range of interests (and about 21 years experience as of April 2004).


No, this isn't intended to be a giant commercial (a lot of these tools are OpenSource).


(Deep breath)
Core interests in software:
	* User interface design and usability http://www.oofile.com.au/adsother/UIDesign.html
	* Cross-platform development (especially Mac to Windows/Unix) http://www.oofile.com.au/crossplat.html
	* Database application development tools and putting usable C++ API's on top of ISAM engines like Faircom's c-tree Plus http://www.oofile.com.au/databasedev.html
	* Information presentation, especially printing and reporting http://www.oofile.com.au/reportwriter.html
	* Code generation  (worked on AppMaker and Marksman nee Prototyper)
	* AgileProcesses - I started work on processes like my Diary-Driven Development in the early nineties http://www.oofile.com.au/adsother/SoftwareEngineeringIdeas.html
	* XML tools including the expatpp wrapper http://www.oofile.com.au/xml.html
	* PythonLanguage (I've got religion!)
	
If you are more formally interested in my services, look at http://www.oofile.com.au/andy/AndyDentShortResume.html but I'm currently on a 18 month term at the CSIRO, working in Predictive Mineral Discovery, stretching my scientific programming skills.


The more human side - I have two children from my first marriage, enjoy Ice Dancing, Scuba Diving and have been practising Chinese Martial Arts for most of my adult life.



I am also very interested in Solar House design, and we're now living in a house built to our design. I will eventually have pages posted showing the progress of the design process - we spent about 8 months refining it.
