These days (1999) I distinguish between Modeling and Designing.  I say
	* "Modeling" is describing something you know. A good model makes correct assertions.
	* "Designing" is manipulating space for things you don't know. A good design e.g., lets you change things easily (there are many dimensions of 'goodness').
You take a drawing of the Model into the room full of business and database and other experts.  They critique it to see whether it contains any FalseAssertionsAndUnattractiveRestrictions regarding their business.

"Designing" for me is manipulating space for things you know for sure (i.e. you have running automated tests for). --KentBeck

Just as a good design lets you change things easily, so does a good modeling language.  From ''InformationModelingAndRelationalDatabases'' by TerryHalpin, the following criteria provide a basis for evaluating conceptual modeling languages:
* Expressibility
* Clarity
* Simplicity and orthogonality
* Semantic stability
* Semantic relevance
* Validation mechanisms
* Abstraction mechanisms
* Formal foundation

A design is a model without any implementation-specific or technology-specific details. A model is a design with those details.

Programmers are prone to seeing a spectrum of detail between designs and models, but this is false. There is a very sharp distinction between the two determined by the fact that users of a system only ever see its design whereas implementors are most interested in the model details. The ExplicitUserModel of a system is its design.

'''''Hmm.''' An ''architecture'' is a description (with visuals, perhaps) of a system containing modeling information, but lacking implementation or (sometimes) technology-specific details. A ''design'' is one solution to an architecture that fits technology to the system. The ''code'' is one particular implementation of the design that expresses a particular technology with specific details. This is the normal descent of granularity in designing. Eh?''
