(ISBN 0932633161), a new spin on problem solving; spend more defining the problem than attempting to solve it!

Actually, for my money, anything Gerry writes is worth getting; writing one great book is an achievement, but 30? Thanks, Gerry. -- StewartBaird

''After the "No matter how it looks at first, it's always a people problem." insight, what more can be said?''

Seriously, are there any quotable quotes out from this book? I live in a country where I cannot browse a lot of the books at bookstore, and have already exhausted my book budget long ago, are there any scraps to share?

''spend more defining the problem than attempting to solve it''

Sounds like TestDrivenDevelopment to me! :-)

Any time you solve one problem you create another - until you have thought of five possible problems you are about to create, you don't understand the original problem. It's a great book.
