German author, born 1877, died 1962. He wrote a number of novels dealing with themes of the subconcious and spirituality including one named ''Siddhartha'', a story set in Northern India during the time of Siddhartha Gautama (The Buddha). Other novels included ''Steppenwolf'', ''Journey to the East'', ''Rosshalde'', and ''The GlassBeadGame'' (also known, incorrectly, as ''Magister Ludi''). Hesse received the Nobel Prize in 1946.

There's a good summary/deconstruction of ''Siddhartha'' in SheldonKopp's book ''If You Meet The Buddha On the Road, Kill Him!''.
