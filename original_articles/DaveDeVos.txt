Dave de Vos is JustaProgrammer from the Netherlands.

He is very interested in subjects like AgileProcesses, FourLayerArchitecture and DesignPatterns.

His main hobby is playing the GameOfGo. He has recently reached the level of 4 dan.
He hopes that one day he will succeed in writing a strong go-playing program (something at which nobody has been successful, in spite of a 1 million dollar prize standing out for more than 5 years now)
