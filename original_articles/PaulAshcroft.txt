PaulAshcroft is a MicrosoftCertifiedProfessional with a special interest in bringing the full force of ExtremeProgramming  into the MicrosoftSolutionsFramework and .NET development environment.

I am actively looking to build relationships with (that includes working for!) companies that are serious about going down the XP path - especially ones which also use Microsoft tools.
