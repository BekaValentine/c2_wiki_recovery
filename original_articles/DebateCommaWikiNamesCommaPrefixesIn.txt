Hey, you guys, If you're going to argue that prefixing pages with their type identifier is the way to go, then let's get it right.

Whatsa matta you?  You can't ThinkMilitary?

Let's make this as rigid and Teutonic as we possibly can.

Movie, Willows, Wind in the

Book, Earth, Journey to the center of the

Idea, dumb, dumb, really, really.

I used to room with a guy who was a supply sergeant in the USAF.  We'd sit around making up bogus "supply system compliant" names for things.  Very "object oriented" naming.  We'd laugh til our sides hurt.

Look, if you want to accomplish a searchable or categorical indexing system to make it possible to relate content and locate related content, the damn name isn't going to be your ticket.

Now, knock it off before I go all MontyPython on you.
* I don't want to argue about this.
* ''Yes, you do.''
* No, I don't.
* ''Do too!''
* Do not!
