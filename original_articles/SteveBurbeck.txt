A very interesting fellow, and a good person to know.  He founded his own Smalltalk compiler company in the early 80's, then worked as a manager at Apple on the MacApp project. After that he became the vice-president and COO of KnowledgeSystemsCorporation.  From 1995 - 2005 he was a senior researcher/developer/deep-thinker at IBM.  Now he is an independent consultant.

Just a wee bit more detail (guaranteed 45% accuracy free)...
Steve formed SoftSmarts with AbdulNabi. I believe that they produced the first Xerox-independent Smalltalk system - pre Digitalk. Xerox/PARC didn't like this and sat on them.

Still more detail (guaranteed 100% accurate)...
Softsmarts was founded by Robert Roessler and myself in 1985.  Jerry Latter (now CIO of Rockefeller University) joined next and then Abdul Nabi.  We first did a Lisp port which sank like a stone, then moved on to Smalltalk.  Softsmarts produced the first fully Xerox compliant Smalltalk-80 for the IBM PC-AT, which we called Smalltalk-AT (say it out loud...clever, huh?).  Robert Roessler did most of the work on the virtual machine.  I focused on the Smalltalk image modifications and writing documentation (e.g., the paper on MVC which is now widely cited, see Google, and has been translated into Russian). Smalltalk-AT came out about the same time as Digitalk's "Methods" (at the first OOPSLA in 1986) which predated Digitalk Smalltalk by a year or so.  Due to royalty agreements with Xerox, Softsmarts could not compete with Digitalk's $100 pricing.  Xerox (by then ParcPlace) thought the proper price point was $1000, not $100.  The market agreed with Digitalk.  Nuf said.
