I just wanted to define the IdeaMethodology (YetAnotherMethodology) page but couldn't
find the appropriate place :) 
''Actually it should be IDEAMethodology but that wasn't picked up by Wiki''

About me: Started out in Adelaide, Australia as a undergrad in ComputerScience,
did Honours year at the ANU in Canberra, worked for the CSIRO with the
SIS Group, then moved to Berlin, Germany working on the MMM [basically
an ASP [*not* the Microsoft ASP] for mathematical models] at the 
Humboldt Uni, and currently at Oracle in the Object Technology and 
Middleware Group.

How did I get onto XP? Through a book review of KentBeck-s book in the iX [or was that the c't?]. [Which i then read -- the book that is, the article was duly skimmed] Why do I like XP? Because I believe that there has to be a better to build software then the current method of GoldenEggLaying. BTW has anybody done a study comparing OpenSource with XP ? I would be interested in doing something like that -- perhaps finding the best of both worlds .... or is XP really CorporateOpenSource ....

Of course, now the Microsoft has released .net, alles ist vergiftet, und ich bin total-verruckt. I have to finally admit that open source has been appropriated for the greater good by Gates und Ballmer - is this the end of the struggle?
''Someone involved in OpenSource development in Java once said to me that they saw GrayBoxTesting as the key thing the two approaches have in common. We should have more about this on Wiki I think. But as my experience of OpenSource development is zero, I'll let others lead the way. -- RichardDrake''
 
Definitely an OpenAuthor, and can be contacted directly at mailto:Gerrit.Riessen@wiwi.hu-berlin.de
