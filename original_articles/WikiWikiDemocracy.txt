A Rant that triggered this page:
* All right, all right, let's get this straight. GeorgeBush is not the problem. There are a lot of ... in the world, and he's just one of them. The problem is we all just sat around and let this particular ... all over America. I mean we amplified his ... through loudspeakers, we poured it in our eyeballs through the TV, and we cranked it through the Internet like it was hamburgers on Sunday.
* GeorgeBush will go - you can see him going now. We are waking from the dream of fascist America and we must all give .. him .. a little push - just a little one - so that he can feel 300 million little pushes all at once. Which will amount to a mighty shove.
* And that means you - yes, you gentle reader. You must take a few moments out of your life and think about how you - yes, you personally - can help America get rid of this evil smell once and for all. It is not enough to blame GeorgeBush for everything that's happened and think, well, good riddance to bad rubbish. GeorgeBush is just like a Lantana flower - there's a whole huge vine of the stuff and it's spread all through everything. If we're gonna get rid of the shrub we gotta poison it at the root.
* Now where is the root of GeorgeBush? Well, it's in this so-called democracy we got right here. It's not worthy of the name. You know it, and I know it. We're sitting here in the 21st century stuck with a 12th century show of hands once every 4 years with 3/4 of the hands tied behind peoples' backs. And that won't work - it will just saddle us with another GeorgeBush, new face, new line of crap, same stupidity-in-power.
* It is time, ladies and germs, for a WikiWikiDemocracy. Time to do it over. Put your thinking caps on - we have a mess of brush to cut and some sustainable horiculture to invent. Let's get busy.

''WikiWikiDemocracy. That is an interesting concept. A democratic process via a medium called Wiki. Could this work? If so, How?''
* Description of "Democracy"
** http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy 
* Mature Democracy
** Democracy is created and supported by its citizens, and nurtured and developed by its leaders. 
** It cannot be imposed "top-down" by authority, nor will it emerge "bottom-up" from chaos. 
** Instead, it is a product both of form (the right structures) and function (the right purposes). 
** Democracy works not only because it pragmatically allows citizens to carry on their lives in an orderly fashion, but because 
**it allows people the opportunity to create the meaning that gives those orderly lives their purpose.
* It also will:
** Favor enlightened self-interest and the common good.
** Respect individuals and rights; value relationships and responsibilities.
** Focus on process.
** Allow virtually unfettered opportunity for innovation and growth in all dimensions (political, moral, social, etc.-not just economic).
** Promote continuous dialogue.
** Foster multiple dimensions of, and access to, power.
** Create units large enough to allow diversity; small enough to encourage community; 
***    flexible enough to promote innovation; and 
***    strong enough to counterbalance tribalism, globalism, corporatism, and entropy.
** Encourage constant interaction between the process, practices, and products of democracy.
