Ok, I guess the rking is back.

After a long sabbatical as a blue collar worker, I'm giving up and going back to the comfortable old programming job.  I really don't hate programming... but there is something to be said for making your way out there in the sometimes-cold, sometimes-hot, sometimes-just-right non-virtual world.

You'll find some of my junk at these places:
  * http://search.cpan.org/~king/ - Hopefully this will end up being well-populated.  I'm happy with Clipboard.pm so far.
  * http://panoptic.com/rking - Did I mention junky?

BrianIngerson and SteveHowell are two programmers who have:
	* my respect
	* got me work.
