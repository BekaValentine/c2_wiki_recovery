Also known as dbXML.

This is one of the better known native XmlDatabaseServers that can also be run under WindowsOperatingSystems. It is based on the OpenSource''''''d BerkeleyDatabase.

I am looking for an expert to help build an MSWindows ComComponent that can allow VbClassic to create and change XML DOM objects, using dbXML as the storage medium. I would like to use this as a means to learn XmlProgramming but I lack CeePlusPlus skills. 

In terms of where to get BerkeleyDbXml:

	*  http://www.sleepycat.com/products/xml.shtml
	*  http://www.dbxmlgroup.com/index.html

I do not know whether the SleepyCat version listed above is open source or not. It is available for download so assumption is taken it could be free for developers.

PleaseComment if you can help.

These are 2 separate projects, both open source. -- 128.117.65.26

 * BerkeleyDbXml is based on BerkeleyDb C library.
 * dbXml is pure Java, and is more recent.

''What does it mean pure Java, does it work at all in Windows 9x and using Microsoft Java?''

Note that "native XML" is a bit misleading.  BerkeleyDbXml is a layer on BerkeleyDb; it parses XML, cracks it up into fragments and stores these in the original db format.  The interface is extended by a mechanism to execute queries against the Xml tree.  Apparently it can also create indices to accelerate the queries, though I had no luck in getting to perform anything, let alone with decent performance.
