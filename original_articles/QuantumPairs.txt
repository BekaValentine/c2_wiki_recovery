	 :	QuantumPairs solves the problem of remote development, by creating a concurrent, realtime, editor that allows two or more programmers to work simultaneously on the same document. QuantumPairs was developed from the ground up to literally track the changes occurring in the documents in a low bandwidth protocol... It is possible (even comfortable) to use even on 56k dialup.
