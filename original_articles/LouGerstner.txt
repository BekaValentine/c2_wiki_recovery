Lou Gerstner was an outsider brought in to BigBlue to reinvent the company in 1993, and was credited for his success in CulturalTransformation.

'''Culture is everything''' is one of his famous quotes. See http://hbswk.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3209&t=organizations

When he left in 2002, it was said he succeeded in changing the culture of "individualism" to "total solution provider", which could include solutions from outside competitors as well.

A 2005 article on departure of HP CEO, based on information by the headhunter for HPs failed experiment, was that Lou effected changes by working with the existing people.
