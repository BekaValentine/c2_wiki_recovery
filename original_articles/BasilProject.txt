The technology that is sought is LanguageTranscendentComputing. In order to build such an environment I am proposing to create a platform of the following elements:
	* BasilParserDevelopment
	* BasilMetamodeling
	* BasilBackendFramework

For more information, seek the many hats of Basil, the killer project:
	* Basil on SourceForge - http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/basil/
	* Basil on WildIdeaPreserve - http://www.wildideas.org/basil/
	* BasilProjectLog

* 2002/10/10 Is this dead?  I was interested in seeing where it had got to.
* 2003/01/18 I am trying to abduct undergraduate mind share for the purpose of making it go.  I am always interested in talking about it, I mean it is VaporWare after all, and is worthy of lengthy speculation. :) -- JonRiehl
* 2004/12/08 Any further news?
* 2006/04/18 Sure.  This time last year I tried to push forward with some grammar refactoring tools, and right now I'm trying to assimilate MetaBorg (building a SDF2 round trip integration).  I wanted to start playing better with the PythonLanguage people, possibly working on getting the AST stuff pushed out from C, and by blocking on that I'm stalling an initial 0.1 release.  -- JonRiehl
