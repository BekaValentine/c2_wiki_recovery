WallData was a middleware company.  They built a 3270 terminal Emulator for OS/2 and Windows that a lot of clients (GE Capital among them) used instead of IBM's products.

''With annual revenues of $139.4 million in fiscal 1996, Wall Data has 745 employees. The company has worldwide headquarters in Kirkland, Washington, corporate
headquarters in Palo Alto, California, and 67 offices worldwide.''

Is that "worldwide" as in "also outside Northern America"?

''Update'' WallData is deceased. Bought out by NetManage, which appears to be on the way to being deceased.

WRQ also did a very nice terminal emulation called Reflection;  I like the interface better. -- JoeFecarotta
