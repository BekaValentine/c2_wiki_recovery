Is there a chronicle on the Web's "last pages" like the one in http://www.w3schools.com/html/lastpage.htm ?

Do we know which one was the very first one? I vaguely remember it resting somewhere in the .ch domain but I am not sure. Plus it would be nice to locate the original author and ask him "What provoked that page?".
