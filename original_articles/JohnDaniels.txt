With JohnCheesman, I wrote a book on UmlComponents.

With coauthor SteveCook, I developed the SyntropyMethodology

I'm an independent consultant, working under the name Syntropy Limited.

I have worked with object-oriented tools and techniques continuously since 1984, applying them in a wide range of application areas, from factory automation to banking. I wrote and presented the first commercial training course on object-oriented design in the UK in 1986. My main areas of interest and research in object technology are concerned with system architectures, object modelling and project management.
