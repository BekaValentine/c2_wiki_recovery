What I really would like to try out is attaching little soundfiles with spoken comments to classes/methods. Does anybody have any ideas (or even experience) on how to do this?

You could embed the URL to a sound file in the comments.

And then write an editor macro to identify sound urls (i.e. with a regular expression) and play the audio file in response to user input such as a mouse click.
