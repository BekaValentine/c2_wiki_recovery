Three frenchmen are sitting in a traditional Parisian cafe on the left bank of the Seine, discussing the meaning of the phrase, "Savoir-Faire".

"Savoir-Faire," says the first, "is like zis: you come home, after a hard day's work, and you open ze front door of your house, and you see your beautiful wife, stark naked, on a bear-skin rug, in front of a roaring fire, making love to anozer man, and you say, 'Oh, excuse me, please continue' - zen, you have Savoir-Faire."

"Non," says the second, "you really have zis wrong. You see, Savoir-Faire is zis: you come home after a hard day's work, and you open ze front door of your house, and you see your beautiful wife, on a bear-skin rug, in front of a roaring fire, stark naked, and making love to anozer man, and you say, 'I'm sorry to interrupt, but would you like a drink?' - alors, zen, you have Savoir-Faire."

"I'm so sorry," says the third, "but you are both mistaken. Let us say you come 'ome after a hard day's work, and you open ze front door, and you see your beautiful wife, stark naked, in front of a roaring fire, on a bear-skin rug, making love to anozer man, and you say, 'Oh, excuse me, please continue' - and zat man can - zen he has Savoir-Faire!"

I told this joke to a french woman.  She said, no, if the husband were immediately to murder both the wife and the lover, that would be SavoirFaire.
