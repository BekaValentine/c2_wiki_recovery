'''HTAG''' is a programming language developed by SvenNeumann because he was fed up with other languages only ''almost'' doing what he wants them to do.

HTAG is mainly intended for the design of WebSite''''''s.

HtagLanguage has now gained a <!%REGEXREPLACE%> command, based on the PCRE implementation of the CeeLanguage, PerlFive Compatible, RegularExpression Evaluator.
----

'''Known uses'''

The HtagWiki has added some RegularExpression parsing to Htag.

A database for user-managed restaurant menus at http://www.FoodForfun.com is written entirely in the HtagLanguage, currently the only major commercial WebSite to be so.

The website http://www.GoldenPagesMalta.com is written now almost entirely in HtagLanguage (although a slightly out of date version) while the rewrite in pure HtagLanguage is almost complete (as of 2003-07-14) and is currently found at http://ywp.d2g.com.

'''Available implementations'''

Apparently none - not that I looked very hard.

Commands in the HtagLanguage.

Commonly delimited with "<!%" and "%>". The author, SvenNeumann is well aware of this ClunkySyntax and has revising it high on his ToDo.
