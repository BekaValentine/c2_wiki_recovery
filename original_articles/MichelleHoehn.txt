Hi!

I thought about changing references to myself elsewhere on the wiki but decided against at least at this point. Anyone watching RecentChanges have any opinions on whether that would be necessary and/or okay?

;)

shrug

You can look at DaveHoehn for my original page at least for now.

It's been awhile since I was active here but I do check back from time to time. Today I wanted to show someone TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign, and after a few more years of experience than last write (wow, 7 more years it looks like) it just occurred to me that really TheSourceCodeIsTheDetailedDesign would be a more appropriate statement, so I typed it into the address bar and it came up! :D

I love it here.

I'm an open book, happy to answer any questions.

Just as an update: current platforms/languages are

* Debian Linux w/ Xenomai RT co-kernel
** C++ for real-time stuff, POSIX Xenomai skin
** Mono/C# for non real-time tasks
* Windows XP/Vista
** Visual Studio .NET/C# -- Still my favorite!

MicrosoftDotNetDiscussions still pretty much describes my opinion of Microsoft and .NET/C# in general. :) Did I mention Microsoft rules? Yay Microsoft!
 :P
