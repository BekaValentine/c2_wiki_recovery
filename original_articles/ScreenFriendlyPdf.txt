It's possible to make PDFs that look good on screen, but only if you accept the idea of generating separate versions for print and screen:

* Paper version:  http://math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/tutorial/pdfmarks/hyper_p.pdf
* Screen version: http://math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/tutorial/pdfmarks/hyper.pdf
* More Examples:  http://math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/acrotex.html

These were produced with LaTex (and they convinced me to use LaTex for a project I'm working on now). If anyone knows how to get this kind of PDF from DocBook, I'd love to see some samples.
