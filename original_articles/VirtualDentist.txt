A most interesting application of Virtual Reality simulation environments is in the dentist's chair:  ...to keep the patient distracted while the dentist drills out your teeth.
If your dentist doesn't offer a VR headset for long procedures like fillings and root canals, '''get a new dentist.'''

Equipment:
	* '''VCR''' - to play tapes.
	* '''Visor with "TV" screen''' - for viewing.  (OK if screen is small and seen by one eye.)
	* '''earphones'''

Advantages:
	* Less stress for patient:  A good film can be pleasantly distracting.
	* Patient moves less, making it easier for the dentist to operate.
	* Procedures typically take less time.
-----
Selection of tapes, for your viewing pleasure:
	* cartoons for the kids
	* music video for the older kids

Drilling is noisy; avoid films with important dialog, as the patient will miss much of it.  Prefer films that are highly visual.

Avoid mystery and suspense films, unless the patient can take the tape home to see how it ends.

Avoid extremely funny movies; it's hard to work on a patent who's laughing.

Recommended films:
	* "Jesus Christ, Superstar"
