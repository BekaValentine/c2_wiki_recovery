It seems that lots of people are thinking about the different ways of searching different wikis; of using categories on different wikis; of linking to other wikis.  But how do wikis actually talk to each other? A standard needs to be defined for such a purpose. Has this been done? It should be possible to migrate from one wiki system to another without a hassle. It should be possible to exchange wiki pages over different wikis (for caching purposes for example). A definition of the core wiki functions and formatting needs to be defined (what is a MinimalWiki?). The exchange language, of course, needs provisions for the extension of this basic set. Oh - and all this without getting bloated :)

I use an XML document format for SennikiWiki. It's rather simple right now.

    <page version='1'>
      This is some text with a literal <link>Link</link> to the page named Link.
      Here is a symbolic <link url='http://www.slashdot.org'>Link</link> to Slashdot.
    </page>

It's not usable as a standard for most wikis but it's fairly minimal.

How about just using SimplifiedDocBook? -- DimiterKurtev
