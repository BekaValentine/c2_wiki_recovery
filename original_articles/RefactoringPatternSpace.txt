A lot of patterns have been written.  Some are well-written, some are
not.  There are many duplications.  Some are special cases of others, some
overlap.  Patterns need to be reorganized.

It doesn't make sense to try to do it all at once.  Instead, a better idea
is to take a set of related patterns and try to reorganize them.  Perhaps
this will lead to PatternLanguage''''''s.

There are several attempts to do this in progress at the moment. We would like to know of (and encourage) others.

	* OrganizationalPatterns -- lead by JimCoplien and others.
	* "Introducing Patterns into an Organization" -- MaryLynnManns and LindaRising.
	* PedagogicalPattern
	* telecom patterns -- the TelePlop gang (including BobHanmer, JimDoble, NeilHarrison, JohnLetourneau and others)
	* text based communication -- JoshuaKerievsky, RonGoldman, RichardGabriel and others.

This page could be called RefactoringPatterns, but that name was
already taken to mean source code refactoring patterns.

''Might a Topic Page work better? This way, the page does not have to be updated each a new page is created. Instead, tHe new page merely needs to reference something like ''T''''''opicPatternRefactoring'', or some such to be included in its listing.''
