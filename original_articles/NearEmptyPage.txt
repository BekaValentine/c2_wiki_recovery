A NearEmptyPage is a question - it's asking whether an idea resonates with someone here or not. If it doesn't resonate with you personally, fine, leave it be. If the page stays empty for a few weeks or months, then by all means delete it. Otherwise just you FixYourWiki and give these other seeds of signal time to flower.

''I'm not sure what I think of this. I haven't been deleting new, NearEmptyPage''''''s myself. But perhaps it should be incumbent on the starter of a new page to actually make an effort to justify that page's existence right from the start. I'm thinking, for example, of IllusionOfChaos, which seems to me to stem from a "Throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks" approach.''

''I'm reminded of the complaint of a friend who worked at a literary journal in college: "Good poetry can be short, but we get so many bad poems here because people think they can just dash stuff off and submit ten at a time."''

Sometimes page title could be the reason for deleting, if it's inconsistent with page contents page looks much more doubtful. What should people with weaker command of EnglishLanguage do in this case?

''If you have weak command of a language, then you shouldn't try to write short, pithy sayings in it. I was always wordier and less clever when I was living in Spain; yet the tradeoffs were worth the experience of communicating with others.''
Or, you could do your best, explain what you're trying to say, and ask for help from someone else. Pages can be renamed easily, especially new ones.

The point made is not about what the page contains, but the right of the poster to have the page seen by those other than the viewers of a single, or a few days.  Perhaps if you feel you must delete such a page and it is new, let it roll off of the RecentChanges first.

''The impression I get is that some people want to delete NearEmptyPage''''''s because they don't feel like the page presents anything new, and is just sort of rambling. Obviously, the line between "rambling non-idea" and "undeveloped idea with potential" is highly subjective, but so is everything else here on Wiki.''

''I will also say that too many people here place too much importance on starting new pages and contributing new content -- and not as much on less visible behavior like contributing to existing pages, and refactoring other people's content. I would even go so far as to say that one could fairly put a "burden of proof" against all new pages: All new pages should prove their right to exist or they are fair game for deletion. (I'd also say that the burden should be relatively forgiving, but a page like IllusionOfChaos seems like it would hardly pass such a test.)''
