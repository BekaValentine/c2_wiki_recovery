I'm interested in just about everything about software and software development.  My main areas of focus are software development processes, object-oriented and component-based development, and coding with C++ and Java on Unix.  Lately, though, I've been doing Windows desktop development in C++.

These days I'm temporarily living in San Jose, California, but threatening to move up San Francisco at any moment.  My current work up there might end soon, so I'm (rather lazily) looking for a job in San Francisco.

I've been a lurker here for quite some time; back in school at University of Illinois for computer science I heard about wiki from RalphJohnson.

I don't really check this wiki very often anymore.  You can leave a message here, but the best way to get hold of me is email to tim_huske at yahoo dot com
