PoliticallyIncorrect is a cool talk show hosted by BillMaher.  Each evening they have 4 guests and discuss some current event or philosophy.  Unfortunately, it is late at night, so I seldom watch more than a few minutes of it.

''Considering that they've got four guests on at once, they really should get a host that doesn't like to talk as much as BillMaher does.''
