RealData is the data counterpart to RealInformation. Real data tends to be precise, of high quantity and not directly meaningful to a non-programmer. A UserInterface is generally used to convert RealData to something the user can use. RealData can be converted to RealInformation using DataMining or Endemes, or AdHoc conversion within a user interface specifically designed to organize and provide context for a user. Most programmers work in the world of RealData and their field can be called DataOrientedProgramming.

RealData is generally expected to meet the AcId test. RealInformation is not. It gets a little tricky with a KnowledgeDatabase which uses information to address data. I'll have to think about that.
