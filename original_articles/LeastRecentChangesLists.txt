I have created lists of pages according to their edit stamp.

   Year of    Number in  Number in
    stamp      2004-10    2005-01
           
    1998          418        371
    1999          296        270
    2000         1423       1283
    2001         2026       1845
    2002         2808       2489
    2003         7116       6064
    2004        15324      17514
    2005            0        150

Note that no numbers can go up except those for the current year.

Some pages have stamps that are at odds with the change date given when the page is listed. I don't know why - this is gleaned from my logs and is completely independent of Ward's database.

* LeastRecentChangesNinetyEight
* LeastRecentChangesNinetyNine

from LeastRecentChanges, there are still differing views regarding this approach.

Is it possible to make available the script to redo this analysis? I have seen good pages rescued already. Thanks for your initiative.

''I make the following observation. This page and the ideas that gave rise to it are, in some part, '''a reaction against RecentChanges and the "now now now" mentality'''. To update this page too quickly could be regarding as falling into the same trap. Leave it lie for a time and see what comes of it.''
* So ArguingWithGhosts is the lesser evil, compared to WikiNow?
** ArguingWithGhosts does not contradict WikiNow, but rather corroborates it
