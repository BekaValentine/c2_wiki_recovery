Two glossed poems from the forthcoming ''What is Lojban'' booklet (see LojbanLanguage) are available from the booklet-in-development website: a poem in quartains (http://www.lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/bradi.html) and a sonnet (http://www.lojban.org/publications/level0/brochure/ckape.html). (Keep clicking for English translation and interlinear gloss.) Comments welcome, btw.
