The Sussex XP Users Group is a real world discussion group in Brighton UK formed with the help of the British Computer Society. We plan to cover Extreme Programming and agile.

Anyone is welcome, from novices to experts. There is no charge, but you might have to buy your own beer.

Meetings are on the last Wednesday of each month. The first meeting is on 27th March at the Lord Nelson pub, Trafalgar Street, Brighton, and thereafter. For further details see http://agilesussex.org/
