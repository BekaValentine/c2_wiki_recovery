We humans have a tendency to treat flow as an iteration of things. We talk about waves on the ocean, or clouds in the sky, or gods with long beards and white robes. Every discourse takes on dramatic identity. We forget ThereAreNoConspiracies. We treat communities as commodities - see WikiFarm - and the media as the message.

Sometimes doing this is profitable. Other times it disrupts the very flow it encodes. Other times it is vain. The trick is seeing flow as flow, and letting things arise and decay in their own time.
