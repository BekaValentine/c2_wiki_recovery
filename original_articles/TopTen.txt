There are a couple "magic" pages that you might see in the TopTen:

	* FaviconDotIco, which shows up quite often.  It might mean that someone bookmarked the site.  This isn't certain, though, since FaviconDotIco is also used for other purposes.

	* RobotsDotTxt, which is less common.  It probably means someone wanted to spider the site (this includes search engines as well as people using tools like wget).
