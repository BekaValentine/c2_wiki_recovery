Mishtu Banerjee is a partner in Harmeny Systems (http://www.harmeny.com), a resource management consulting firm, located in British Columbia. A forester whose knees gave out in the bush, he now spends a great deal of time in front of a computer; still working with trees and forests, but now as mathematical abstractions. Still, they are just as pretty.
