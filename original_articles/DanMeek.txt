Anyone can edit this page. Hi Dan,

Yes, anyone can edit this page, including deleting everything on it. Wikis are a powerful concept, and I strongly suggest you read WelcomeVisitors, which explains a little more about this particular wiki.

This is very strange. No-one is reading this. Au contraire. I am. Welcome Dan! Perhaps you can tell us more about yourself, your interests in programming, and other such tidbits.

BTW, you need %20 instead of space in various links in voters.net.

Welcome Dan, if you haven't yet, check out NewUserPages and TourBusStop.

Dan is a well-known political activist in the PortlandOregon area.
