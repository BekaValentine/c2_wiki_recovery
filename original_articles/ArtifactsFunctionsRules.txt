''... Annotated values, a reification of the notion of storage cell, are used to implement active values for procedural activation and properties for structural annotations. The implementation satisfies a number of criteria described for efficency of operation, and non-interference with respect to other paradigms of programming. The AccessOrientedProgrammingParadigm of programming has been integrated with the LoopsMultiParadigm knowledge programming system wich also provides ... for users'' :
