Lessen your sense of self in order to create something greater than your self. 

You mean strive to achieve negative self-esteem? But seriously, is the problem that we think too highly of ourselves, or is the problem that we will not allow ourselves to think highly enough about other people (as if the way we think about them would in any way impact our survival)? -- WaldenMathews 

I mean lessen your sense of self as an alternative to solipsism. I know of people who view themselves as very small in the world but have incredible self-esteem and power. It's a paradox and difficult for western minds to intuitively grasp. If your view of the world puts yourself at the center, it becomes impossible to create something that can rise above yourself. This isn't a concept meant for syllogistic reasoning. Sometimes viewing yourself as less significant can be an enabling exercise ... can get you to supersede yourself. -- RobertDiFalco 

"It may be possible for each to think too much of his own potential glory ... it is hardly possible for him to think too often or too deeply about that of his neighbour." -- CsLewis in TheWeightOfGlory? 

I see it as a positive analogy to the dictum that the most dangerous man is he who has nothing to lose - if you are too caught up in your sense of self, you become possessive of the trappings, and cannot do some of the things you might.
