A WikiRefactoring where an unsigned comment is appended with the "signature" of the author (or whoever is believed to be the author)--this includes adding DramaticIdentities or WikiBadge''''''s such as AnonymousDonor.  This can be done for several reasons.

* To clean up a ThreadMess--it is easier to follow messy ThreadMode when the comments are attributed to who wrote them (so two adjacent postings don't appear to be from the same contributor).

* To attribute possibly controversial opinions to their authors, especially when someone thinks another is engaging in VoiceOfWikiImpersonation

However, this is not always appreciated....

Proper addition of the author's signature consists of nothing else but that:  adding two dashes, and the individuals name.  Adding additional editorial comments, such as "in the opinion of SoAndSo" or "SoAndSo, in a moment of obvious drunkenness, scrawled the following rant" is likely to trigger a RudenessObjection.

For a counterpoint, see EgolessWiki.  Also consider use of a ContributorsList rather than signing individual contributions.

What a bad idea. If I don't sign something, it's because I don't want it signed. Adding it would '''not''' be ''a courtesy''!


* If someone uses AddTheAuthorsSignature, and the author objects; then the author can remove it.  At which point, the author's wishes ought to be respected.  If someone objects to the author's statement, a dissenting opinion can be added at this point.
