I am a friend of JimCoplien and TomCargill and WardCunningham.  I'm involved
in UbuntuLinux, WikiPedia, IETF, ComputerSecurity, PublicKeyInfrastructure, etc.
I love languages and other big-picture ideas, and keep coming back to
the benefits of PatternLanguage.  Just as you might expect: my MyersBriggs Type is INTP.
