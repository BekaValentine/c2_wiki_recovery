"Verve" is a process engine for executing embedded workflow, now renamed as the Versata Interaction Server (VIS) (http://www.versata.com/versata.vjsp?pageid=235) since being bought by Versata in early 2001. BobbyWoolf has been working with Verve since early 1999.

It originally ran in GemStoneJava (GS/J), and now runs on several JDBC databases, such as Oracle 8i, and in two EJB app servers, WebLogic and WebSphere.

If I remember correctly, the Verve implementation is an example of an AdaptiveObjectModel. -- PatrickLogan
