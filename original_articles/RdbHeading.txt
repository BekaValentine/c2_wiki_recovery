I'm trying to understand TheThirdManifesto.  I don't have a background in databases so I'm trying to bootstrap by first clearly expressing the fundamental terms and concepts.  If you see that I'm making an error in my descriptions, please jump in and help me better understand.  Thanks a mil. --BrandonCsSanders

An '''RdbHeading''' is a set of typed attributes.  To be an RdbHeading, the order of the attributes cannot matter.

 { <x, integer>, <y, integer>, <s, string> } is an RdbHeading.
 { <y, integer>, <x, integer>, <s, string> } is the same RdbHeading.

(also RdbTuple)
