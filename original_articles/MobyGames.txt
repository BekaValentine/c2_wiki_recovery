MobyGames is a web database of published ''video and computer'' games. It includes: descriptions, release details, platforms, box art-work, credits, trivia, and user reviews. Like a Wiki, the entries are contributed by users. Unlike Wiki there is an approval process for submissions. All submissions are copyrighted to MobyGames.

An alternate work that focuses on the authors of 8-bit games is here: http://www.dadgum.com/giantlist/list.html
