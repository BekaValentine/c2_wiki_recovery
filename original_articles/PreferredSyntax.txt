Informally, the ''preferred syntax'' of a language consist of those features which can be accessed by the programmer with a minimal amount of typing (compared to other features of the langage).  Other features may have non-preferred syntax (though be implemented by the language itself); still others may require an external implementation outside the language proper or its libraries.

Important, because SyntaxMatters.  One can often deduce what paradigm a language belongs to by examining its PreferredSyntax. 

(It should be noted that we are discussing ''concrete'' syntax here, not ''abstract'' syntax).
