XpDenver was an XP User Group founded in August of 2000 to serve the Colorado Front Range.  The official group name is now AgileDenver given our inclusive membership. With 800+ mailing list members, we normally meet on the fourth Monday of the month in Downtown Denver. Meetings are free and open to the public, and we encourage open minded discussions on agile software development topics.

Visit our website at http://www.agiledenver.org for up to date information on meetings and other events. Our mailing list is maintained at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/agiledenver. 

AgileDenver is organized by AlexViggio, LisaCrispin, PaulKarsten, DavidFarber, MikeCohn, ScottFlores, JeanTabaka, VictoriaMadison and AlexPukinskis. AgileDenver is a member of the AgileAlliance.

AgileDenver was the host user group for the AgileTwoThousandFive conference.
