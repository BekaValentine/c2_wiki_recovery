Are these things really the same?

* If I return from a SmalltalkLanguage block I wind up back in the scope where it was defined. It is effectively a continuation.
* If I return from a RubyLanguage block I wind up back in the scope of the caller. It is effectively a lambda.

Am I misunderstanding or what?

    require "Continuation"
    callcc do | ret |
       (1..10).each do | i |
          ret i
       end
     end

This replicates the SmallTalk behavior.  So, they are the same thing, but with different concepts of return.  See CallCc.
