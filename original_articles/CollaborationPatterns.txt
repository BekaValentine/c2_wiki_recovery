Quote from second article:
"According to Gottesdiener, collaboration patterns are collections of reusable techniques and activities (such as tasks or actions) that can be used by IT and customer teams in a group setting to work together more effectively. Goals of collaboration patterns include defining project scope, user requirements and ongoing process improvement."
