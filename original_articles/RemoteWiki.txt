Technically, same method as SisterWiki but alternative representation;

the SisterWiki method activated by TwinPages but the RemoteWiki method activated by non-existent WikiNames.

When some WikiName does not exist as RightToFork but exists in other SisterWiki, SisterWiki suggests it indirect method, but the RemoteWiki method suggests each non-existent links directly to SisterWiki's page.
