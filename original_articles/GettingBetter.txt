KentBeck said this on the XpMailingList (found in XpMailingListQuotes):

	 :	"How good the design is doesn't matter near as much as whether the design is getting better or worse. If it is getting better, day by day, I can live with it forever. If it is getting worse, I will die."

The more time goes by the more I realize how true this quote is.  It is very, very costly to make code that is beautiful when viewed statically. It is equally costly to fail to make code a little bit simpler every time you touch it.

Some might feel that this applies to other things, such as:
* the company that you work for
* the team you work with
* cleaning a room
* your life
* ...?

   It's getting better all the time
   I used to get mad at my school
   Now I can't complain
   The teachers who taught me weren't cool
   Now I can't complain
   You're holding me down, ah, turning me round, ah
   Filling me up with your rules, ooh ooh

   I've got to admit it's getting better, better
   A little better all the time, it can't get no worse
   I have to admit it's getting better, better
   It's getting better since you've been mine

   Me used to be angry young man
   Me hiding me head in the sand
   You gave me the word
   I finally heard
   I'm doing the best that I can

   Getting so much better all the time...

   I used to be cruel to my woman
   I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
   Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene
   And I'm doing the best that I can

   Getting so much better all the time...
