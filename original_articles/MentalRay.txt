Mental Ray is rendering software that costs a lot per CPU.  It can be used with SoftImage 3D and XSI (where most people use it), IBM's Catia cad software, and Discreet's ThreeDeeStudioMax (although early reports are that the binding is so poor that while MentalRay is better than the internal renderer, Max can't take advantage of the differences).
