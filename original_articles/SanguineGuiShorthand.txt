SANGUINE - Specific Action Notation for Graphical User Interface Navigation for Everyone

The 'everyone' part of this acronym is probably not valid. It turns out that this notation is geared toward kinesthetic learners.
A new name for this is GuiActionTrace (GAT), since one use of this notation is to trace what actions user takes with a GUI. The extension .gat also makes a nice (and generally unused) file name extension.

SanguineGuiShorthand is one possible solution to the GuiShorthand problem.

The context and forces for this ProtoPattern are on the GuiShorthand page.

----

This system of GUI shorthand is based on the idea of having the direction 
to click on a button look a little bit like a button:

   [button]



The idea is to make things look something like in ascii what they look in the GUI.


 Example:

 -- This is HowToAddPerlToYourSystemPath in Windows 2000 --

 [Start>Setting>Control Panel]
 [[System]]
 [Advanced]
 [Environment Variables...]        # envir.gif #
 |Environment Variables
 |  |System Variables
 |  |  |Path\/|
 |  |  [Edit...]
 |  |  |Edit System Variable
 |  |  |  Variable Value:[_<existingvalue>;<pathtoPerl>_]
 |  |  |__[OK]
 |  |__[OK]
 |__[OK]


 So these are the single character primitives used in the system:

 [   (left bracket)     click - mouse down or key down
 ]   (right bracket)    unclick - mouse up or key up
 <                      text
 >                      end of text (or next item in a selection order)
 :                      label of something
 _   (underscore)       input something (or don't select)
 X                      selection check or maximize or row and column (cell)
 |   (pipe)             inside window (or panel)


 Other single character symbols used are:

 -   (hyphen)           comment or single line ascii art
 (                      description or radio button
 )                      end of description or radio button
 #                      picture or number or screenshot
 .   (period)           wait, repeat, part of key combination, or file structure
 {                      beginning of...
                        a notation for clarification of the previous ']' or '|' element
                        or an action that is optional or is only needed sometimes
                        or a picture file reference used for clarification
 }                      end of...
                        a notation for clarification of the previous ']' or '|' element
                        or an action that is optional or is only needed sometimes
                        or a picture file reference used for clarification
 ^                      control
 /                      menu navigation
 \                      menu navigation or toggle
 '   (apostrophe)       literal or character
 ,   (comma)            list of things
 ^                      control
 +                      single line ascii art
 *   (asterisk)         radio button selection [Preprocessing: convert all selections to *]
 "   (double quote)     refer to this process in this other file or elsewhere in this


 Optional Character Symbols (usually blank):
 ;   (semicolon)        the end of a window
 `   (back tick)        surrounds text sent to the user by the computer
 =                      possibly used to indicate a drag

The notation for Sanguine Gui Shorthand is based on the idea of a button.  The following
symbol is the notation that says 'press the label button':

 [label]

This looks like an ASCII representation of a button with the label 'label' displayed on it. It means 'press the label button'. The rest of Sanguine notation is based on this symbology.

The proper level of detail for this is probably the symbolic keystroke level of detail, so that every keystroke is represented. This provides enough detail for a nontechnical person, and a symbolic format provides enough terseness for a technical person.

'''Examples'''

 -- log in to the system --
 Username: [_<username>_] Password: [_<password>_] [Submit]

 -- select a city name --
 City Name: [city\/] -- a selection list, for example 
                        the selection of a city from a list of cities --

 --	                  -- this is a comment describing the action to be taken.
 Text outside of          -- text you should see on the screen 
   '[' etc. symbols          already as part of the form.

'''Discussion'''
----
Why does the name refer to blood?  Or is that just the way the acronym worked out?

''Sanguine does indeed come from the latin sanguin, or blood, but in English the adjective sanguine has the common meanings of "healthy" or "optimistic".  It comes from the 'four humors' theory of medieval medicine.  Other humorous [ugh, WorstPunEver] adjectives include choleric  (easily angered), melancholy (depressed), and phlegmatic (cool, unemotional); how medieval psychologists came to these as the four basic emotional states is beyond me.'' --TimLesher

I've been working with and on the notation for the past five years now and I have found that a possibly better name for it is GAT. This stands for GUI Action Trace, and seems to be good for tracing what a user actually does in a GUI. I have opened a new page at GatCouldMakeGuisEasier to perhaps further the discussion. --JonGrover

Doesn't SAP have something like this?
----
Users will probably reject this because of the complexity of the notation. A translator would have to be written to convert this to English in order to be acceptable to users. In addition programmers will find the notation ugly.

This proposal is very ambitious.  It tries to show pictures of text boxes and command buttons, using a very brief syntax.  Unfortunately, the [] syntax for showing command buttons can be confusing, especially if the command button text has an arrow on it.  
----
This would be easier for a computer to parse.
----
[RefactorMe:  If you think this is the best solution among ProgrammersGuiShorthand, AsciiArtGuiShorthand, and SanguineGuiShorthand, you may want to reincorporate this page into the GuiShorthand page.]
----

The 'everyone' part of this acronym is probably not valid. It turns out that this notation is geared toward KinestheticLearner''''''s.
A new name for this is GuiActionTrace (GAT), since one use of this notation is to trace what actions user takes with a GUI.
.gat also makes a nice (and generally unused) file name extension. --JonGrover
