AlternativesToXml is a page on solutions that replace the use of Xml completely, or reduce the dependence on raw Xml programming tasks, through the use of higher level tools.

Situations where proposed solutions replace the use of Xml completely include:
* RelationalAlternativeToXml (Which spreads into FusdxDiscussion and FlirtDataTextFormat)
* YamlAintMarkupLanguage (YAML)
* JavaScriptObjectNotation (JSON)
* XmlIsaPoorCopyOfEssExpressions
* ClearSilverHierarchicalDataFormat
* ONX = Open Node Syntax - http://www.seairth.com/web/onx/onx.html
* AbstractSyntaxNotationOne - ASN.1
* Ordered Graph Data Language (OGDL) - http://ogdl.sourceforge.net/
* Sofu - http://sofu.sourceforge.net/
* WikiMarkup - For text
* ZCDSF (see: ZcdsfFileFormat)

for XSLT only:
* XSLScript = a more user-friendly syntax for XSLT - http://www.pault.com/XSLScript/pault/prod/XSLScript
* XSLTXT = the XSLT compact form - http://www.zanthan.com/ajm/xsltxt/index.html / http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/xsltxt

On formatting XML:
* GroupRelatedData
* WBXML (Wireless Binary XML) - a tokenized (compressed) representation for XML, used in WAP (Wireless Application Protocol)
* Binary Optimized XML (BOX) - a tokenized (compressed) representation for XML, intended to be simpler than WBXML, and in particular to provide very easy SAX support - http://box.sourceforge.net/
