A discussion elsewhere of Be Decimal, Be Octal reminded me of this key fact:

Halloween is Christmas.

Because 31 Oct = 25 Dec. 

Another "P''''''eculiarNotion": that Octal = October and Decimal = December
----
Or is it because, immediately after Halloween, the stores put out their Christmas stuff ;-(
