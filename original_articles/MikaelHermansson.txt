I was born in SwedenEurope and I am living in DenmarkEurope.
I have a master degree (1980) from LinkopingSweden. For the last couple of years, I have been doing JavaLanguage programming for an environmental research project: http://www.ecoworks.dk.
I am also fond of PythonLanguage and CsharpLanguage. 

I am living in a small ecological society: http://www.andelssamfundet.dk.
As an administrator for our LocalAreaNetwork, I get in touch with many average computer users.

I am using LinuxOperatingSystem as a webserver, firewall, router, and I am becoming a real fan. It is so amazingly stable. During 6 months, the system has only gone down once. And that's because someone, by mistake, touched the power switch.

Beside my life as a computer consultant, I have another identity. I work a lot with humour, bodylanguage and human communication. I am making talkshows about it: http://www.veryfunny.dk/pomp
I am also performing as a clown. Klovnen Karl Oskar: http://www.veryfunny.dk 

That is why I am extremely interested in starting a HumourWiki.
