Should computer users be regulated, and required to undergo formal training and demonstrate competency before they are allowed unrestricted access to computers? If so, what should the requirements be, and how would they be enforced?

This is best used as a rhetorical defense against licensing of programmers. Since if it were implemented, it would lead to enormous free speech and personal rights violations. Perhaps even China is incapable of implementing it.

Beyond that, ''why'' would this be a good idea? Usually, licensing is required for activities that involve a significant risk to other people - driving, flying, civil engineering practicing medicine, practicing law (there, the risk is usually financial, or the possibility of incarceration for criminal cases). If an incompetent user sits down at the computer, the worst that happens is they download and pass on a virus. There're much less dramatic solutions to that (eg. requiring root access to install programs) than licensing.

''Well then the risk is exactly analogous to the risk that underlies the reasons for licensing lawyers and public accountants (note - not doctors and engineers). The risk is to the harmonious working of society as a whole, by creating an unnecessary financial risk to what has become an essential element of it: computers and networks. The question is whether the risk justifies the means (licensing) of controlling it.''

I don't see the analogy. We're talking computer ''users'', not computer ''programmers''. If a user's incompetent at using the computer, fire them. The stakes just aren't high enough (barring certain mission-critical industries, like NASA, where they already do extensive vetting) to warrant pre-emptive licensing.

''The analogy is that users take something ''already'' defined and use it for their own purposes, as do lawyers and accountants (they have the law and GAAP - GenerallyAcceptedAccountingPrinciples). The risk comes from how they use it and the potential consequences for society (thinking mostly about virus replication here). Note that only some users are employees and subject to firing. One might compare programmers with legislators, who, ironically, are not licensed either. The question of stakes (risk) vs. freedom is the critical one.''

"All users on a ComputerLearnerLicence must display 'L' plates on their monitor (this includes laptops, desktops, tablets or PDAs). 'L' plates must be on both the front and rear of the monitors."

"The 'L' plate must be able to be clearly seen by other users and not restrict your front or rear vision."
