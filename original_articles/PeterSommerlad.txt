It has been really some time since I last visited Wiki. (still true,
we run our intranet wiki for our projects and I still like to thank
Ward for his great invention. it is the SimpleThing that counts.)


As some might see I have left Siemens 1997 and joined IFA Informatik. There I took over
ErichGamma's position, who is now with OTI/IBM in Zurich.
In 1999 four partners and I bought the shares of IFA and
renamed it to itopia[1]. We were doing e-business consulting
and solution development based on an inhouse framework.... (so much for the advertising)

After severe illness diagnosed in 2000 (leukemia), treated with a stem-cell(bone marrow) transplantation in 2001, and about two years of recovery I am up and running again. I joined SYNLOGIC with my development team from itopia in February 2003 but things that year didn't run well. I quit April 2004, looking for some new challenges.
I will become a professor at HSR Rapperswil (http://www.hsr.ch) a technical university in fall 2004.

I am using the time available now for writing and editing a book on SecurityPatterns together with MarkusSchumacher, EdFernandez, DuaneHybertson and FrankBuschmann.
