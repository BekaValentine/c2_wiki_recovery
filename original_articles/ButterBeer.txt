The frothy, buttery drink served in the wizard town of Hogsmeade in the HarryPotter books -- a favorite of HarryPotter and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley.

Here are some recipes:
 
Ingredients:


* Root Beer Soda
* Butter
* Cream 

Directions:

Place 1/4 cube of butter in a microwave-safe bowl and melt it. Pour Root Beer soda into a tall microwave-safe glass and heat on 50% for 30 seconds or as needed so it is moderately warm. (Warning: If it is warmed too much, it won't be fizzy or taste good.)

Pour 1 teaspoon of melted butter into the Root Beer a little at a time, stirring constantly. After butter and Root Beer is well blended, gently add a little bit of cream and stir. It may take a few times to determine the amount of butter and cream needed to make the perfect-tasting ButterBeer!


OR


* 12 fluid ounces of root beer OR cream soda (for American readers, 1 can) 
* 1 tablespoon of honey 
* 2 teaspoons of butter 

Directions:

Step 1: Place root beer (or cream soda) into a microwave-safe glass and heat in microwave for about 30 seconds.

Step 2: Remove root beer (or cream soda) and sit aside while you place butter into microwave long enough to melt it.

Step 3: Now, add your warm root beer (or cream soda), melted butter and honey to the blender and blend for 5-10 seconds. (We recommend 5 as going past this may remove all the fizziness from your root beer (or cream soda) and it just won't taste the same!)

Step 4: Enjoy!

''Reading this, it looks kind of sickening.''

'''I agree. Then again, there are those who might say that about the entire HarryPotter series ;) There's no accounting for taste.'''

I don't think that I'll be ready to eat anything for a few hours after reading that, thank you...
sounds good:)

It does sound gross. Butter and soda?! Never tried that before. Kinda thought butterbeer was just a name for something nice to drink...didn't think it really contained butter. So how does it taste like, anyone tried it? Like some kinda smoothie or milkshake?
