''HowTo release publicPages From PersonalWiki '' -- ThinkingOutLoud DonaldNoyes 20070304

When I read the the following remark from WikiAsProgrammersNotebook, I thought, This for me is an IsureCan kind of thing.

'' My PowerBook runs an instance of SnipSnap for a notebook, and I'm looking to integrate my notebook and personal blog.  Someday, I hope to figure out how to effectively host a shared "snip space" for all our developers, but I haven't figured out how to encourage sharing of knowledge while respecting territory (a ProgrammersNotebook is a very personal thing). -- HansGerwitz ''

'''Mechanism used: P''''''ublicPages WikiTag'''

C''''''hangesRequired: The writing of a few routines in the PersonalWiki which would 
* Be initiated by a S''''''ideBarMenuItem
* Get the names of all pages with the WikiTag, and
* Collect and Publish the pages to a Public (or Designated) area for viewing, or for convenience and size considerations a Zip of all (or Selected Members) of Non-Private pages. 
 
'''Further thoughts:'''
* Or alternatively Publish all or part of the page in a Personal BlogSpace by Subject or by Date
* This might also be useful in publishing TopicalReadingList''''''s which in addition to presenting Public pages from your own Personal Wiki, might also include L''''''inkingPages which refer to P''''''ubliclyAvailable pages or resources which others have produced and which are relevant

A Structure used in a personal information manager one might create could or should include:
* The P''''''ageWithHyperlinks   -- serving as a home base for the topic presented within a larger venue which we might call a "Category"
* The P''''''ageCategories       -- A single or multiple list of "Categories" to which the page belongs
* The E''''''xistanceRecord      -- The record of versions through which the page passes in its lifetime
* The D''''''ifferenceRecord     -- The difference the current page has from the last page state
* The D''''''ateOfChange         -- The date (and perhaps the time also) the page was last changed
* The I''''''dentityOfModifier   -- The name or URL of the last person or entity which changed the page
* The M''''''odificationRecord   -- The names or URLs of those modifying the page, beginning with who or what created it and those following including the most recent
* The BackLinks and ForwardLinks -- Linkages maintained about known BackLinks and developed ForwardLinks
* The R''''''egisteredTerms      -- UnduplicatedList of words, terms, WikiTags, acronyms, dates, values, images, sounds and other objects used in the current page
