* XSOAP -- http://www.extreme.indiana.edu/xgws/xsoap/overview/index.html
** XSOAP (previously known as SoapRMI) is a RMI system based on SOAP that is implemented both in Java and C++ that allows to create and access web services. It has a simple and elegant RMI API that is not limited to Java RMI but is interoperable with Apache SOAP and hopefully any other SOAP 1.1 implementation.
