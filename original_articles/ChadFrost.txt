Chad is the (acting) Area Lead for Autonomous Systems and Robotics, in the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA's Ames Research Center.

I am a proponent of wiki use for small team collaboration and project documentation, having used MediaWiki to good effect on a variety of personal and work projects.

Ward paid us a visit in 2006 and spoke about his original design goals for the WikiWikiWeb, so I thought I'd go back to WardsWiki after not peeking in here for several years.

My general interests include:
* Single-track vehicle (e.g. bicycle) design patterns
* Autonomous flying vehicles
* Emergent behavior
...and gobs of other stuff.
