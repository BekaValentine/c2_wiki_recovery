''Uh, first? What about Dos, Vim, EMACS, Unix, C++, Java, VB SmallTalk, XP ... we are all acolytes of one kind or another here. Nothing new under the sun.''

Not to mention, Kibology nor the Usenet Oracle. You might even neglect to mention TheChurchOfTheSubGenius, since that came before computers took hold. Or forget about Discordianism. You might really choose to totally ignore HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy. And we all never heard about MurphysLaw. (Honestly, I certainly had never heard of the Religion of CHI until today.. honestly, all jokes aside)

WhatIsLogologie

Logologie is a religion of reason. It is free of devilization and has many things common with Buddhism. Its main subjects include the entire
abandonation of brutality and of senseless brain destruction. Its main goal ist the preservation and development of this mankind by teaching
sovereignous- holistical thinking.
