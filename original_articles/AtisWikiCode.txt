I was looking at the code for wiki and noticed line 85 in FormatWiki.pm:

	$_ =~ s/\\.*\n/ /g;

From what I gather, this line takes everything from the backslash to newline and replaces it with a space. This is not something that I want to happen, because sometimes I want to display backslashes! I've looked at the rest of the code, but I can't determine if commenting out this line would break something else. 

Does anyone know what purpose this like serves? And if it's safe to remove it?
Thanks!

From AtisWiki:

Try using the following replacement:

    $_ =~ s/\\[ \t]*\n/ /g; 

...which will only substitute the backslash if it is at the end of a line.

You could just remove that line.  The only thing it would affect are the single-line formatting rules like lists.  Some browsers don't handle really long lines very well, so if you have a long list-item you might want to break it onto multiple lines.  The backslash-code above allows one to use multiple lines, which are combined into one line before the list-item formatting is applied.  

Here's an example:

	* This is a list item that is split on multiple lines using backslashes.

(edit this page to see the backslashes)
