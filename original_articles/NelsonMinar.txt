I am a software engineer at Google. Before then I was CTO and cofounder of Popular Power, an Internet metacomputing company. I used to be a student at the MIT MediaLab, I have a fair amount of information over there.

I have built several large OO projects, including Hive (a bit like Jini, using mobile agents) and Swarm (a complex systems simulator from the SantaFeInstitute). I have not drank the entire glass of XpAndPatternKoolAid, but the first few sips sure are good. I was also one of the people who implemented JikiJikiJava in a mad fit of programming at OopslaNinetyEight.

I learned a whole lot as an apprentice with BillTrost at ReedCollege. I'm part of the BoDo gang with my friends JosephKiniry, MarkBaker, and RonResnick. We run the DistObj list.
