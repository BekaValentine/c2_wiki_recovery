Some people are so famous that they're known by their initials.

Examples:

* RMS (RichardStallman)
* ESR (EricRaymond)
* GLS (GuySteele)
* JMS (JohnMichaelStraczynski, creator of BabylonFive)
* GVR (GuidoVanRossum)
** ''Factoid: GVR happens to be the dutch translation of BFG - the Big Friendly Giant, of RoaldDahl fame.''
*** See MisuseOfFactoid
* JFK (JohnKennedy) (John Forbes Kerry also fits; but he's ''not'' referred to as "JFK")
* JFM (JamesMcGovern) ''Known enterprise architect blogger and industry thought leader''
* FDR (Franklin Roosevelt)
* LBJ (LyndonBainesJohnson)
* MLK (Martin Luther King Jr.)
** Wait, someone stole my initials? :) --MarnenLaibowKoser, 10 Dec 2012
* ken (KenThompson) - yes, it's his name, but he has been known as just "ken" for a long time.
* JWZ (JamieZawinski)

How about people who are well enough known as to be '''recognized''' by a single initial?

Like:
Grouped initials (one per individual - as part of a representation)
* K&R (BrianKernighan & DennisRitchie) - Ritchie is also known as DMR
* RSA (RonRivest, AdiShamir and LeonardAdelman)
* AWK (AlfredAho, PeterWeinberger, BrianKernighan)
Single initial representing most notable person associated with that letter
* W (GeorgeBush [middle initial])
* M and Q (for you James Bond fans)
* T (Mr. T)
** ''No relation to TOP, A.K.A. TopMind.''
* U (floating abbreviationism referring to YOU)

Other people are famous, but are (for whatever reasons) never referred to by their initials. Some are lucky to have a rare first name that is used:
* LinusTorvalds
* WardCunningham
* RasmusLerdorf
* Sir Tim (i.e., TimBernersLee)
