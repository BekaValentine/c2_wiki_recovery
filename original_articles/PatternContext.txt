A PatternContext is used to evaluate a SoftwarePattern.

A PatternContext can be a SoftwarePattern.  An example
is the WikiPattern, which is one context for the 
LogCommentPattern.

The PolliteLens is another Pattern that is also a Context.

What is the relationship between a PatternContext and a
PatternLanguage?
