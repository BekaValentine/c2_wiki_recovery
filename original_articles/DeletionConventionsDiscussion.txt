I have been here many months and yet unaware of the 24 hours convention mentioned on DeleteVulture. It is not directly listed on DeletionConventions. If this is a time-honoured tradition, many others would have missed it too. Also did anyone mention anywhere about seconding deletion of spams? Still 24 hours?
As it stands, DeleteOnceRestoreOnce does not work well. A page created with lots of effort could be deleted within 15 minutes of its creation. 

I suggest maybe there should be a ''fresh discussion'' of DeletionConventions for all current (2004) regulars, instead of referring people to read pages and pages of ''various suggestions to create and delete pages''.

I wasn't aware of the 24 hour convention either, but it seems like a good idea. PeerReview is an essential part of WhyWikiWorks; ForestFire''''''s and other rapid EditWar''''''s defeat that mechanism.

I really think that ''if'' consistently applied, DeleteOnceRestoreOnce works really well. Yes, a page created with lots of effort could be deleted within 15 minutes of its creation. If that page actually contains useful information, it'll be restored within 15 minutes of its deletion. It's not how much effort you put into a page that matters: it's how useful it is to other people. Wiki is a reader-centric medium (or should be, ideally); if you want a writer-centric medium, get a WebLog or LiveJournal.

Of course, the problem with any set of DeletionConventions is getting people to adhere to them. DeleteOnceRestoreOnce doesn't help much if somebody writes a script to delete every minute. -- JonathanTang

'''MicrosoftSlave position on PageDeletion'''

''Never allow anon IP to delete pages, nor to second these deletes.''  
* WikiNow has to be complemented by other considerations a lot of the times.
* If R''''''ecentChanges indeed is not 

I think I get upset by people who deletes pages of existing community members (people who posts often ) in a stealthy manner. And I laud the efforts of DM to publicly identify himself when he wants to do that. 

Most of these difficulties being:
* with just an IP, there is very little information to go seek reasons why a page gets deleted. In many cases the deletion was completed (seconded) by another anon IP. In this situation the person starting the delete sequence is almost invisible.
* with lots of WikiTrolling going on, I think I am at least correct some of the times I feel that are '''agitators wanting C2 community to implode''' (borrowed word).
* there are also new comers wanting to verify page deletion works. Find a page that is marked for delete and seconds it.
