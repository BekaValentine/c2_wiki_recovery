A visitor(=IP) who makes just one single edit can create a page of his own. But he can also edit an existing page - these existing pages seem to be favorites of single-edit visitors:

	*WikiWikiWeb is most popular
	*RecentVisitors
	*OneMinuteWiki
	*FrontPage
	*WikiWikiSandbox
	*WikiWikiWebFaq
	*WelcomeVisitors
	*WikiWeb
	*WhyWikiWorks
