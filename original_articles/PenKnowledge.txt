PenKnowledge was a company formed in Birmingham, Alabama to create a computerised patient records system, with Pen Computers and wireless LANs, in the early 1990s. The vision was way ahead of the technology available and the doctor's mindset was hard to change. A few people from the computer science department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham provided the software engineering manpower to build the solution envisioned by the founder Bill Council. The company was later sold to Riteaid pharmacy.
