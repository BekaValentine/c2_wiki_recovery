WorstThingsFirst is an example of RuleDrivenTasking.  It is often helpful to have a set of policies that everyone is tuned into and knows so that management 
people don't have to explain why something has to stop so something else can be done.  This is primarily important in small companies where everyone is doing almost everything, but it can be important in larger companies especially when allocating scarce resources.  Using Rules you can begin to embed important principles into the culture of the company.
