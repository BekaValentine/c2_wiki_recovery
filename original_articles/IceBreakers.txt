When starting a workshop session we use simple exercises to stimulate thinking and to get participants moving. Collectively called IceBreakers we can use this kind of exercises whenever there is a break or a transition in a workshop. We can use them for introductions with groups or to allow a heterogeneous group to loosen up We can use intellectual puzzles as well as lively games. Common to all is the light, humorous touch. Many organizations provide libraries of IceBreakers for their members to use in planning events.
