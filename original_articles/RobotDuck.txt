''So is this a HomePage, WikiSpam or what?''

Actually this page was initially created by some anonymous visitor, and it said something like 'the best shockwave programmer ever'. I found it by chance via google, and removed the superlative comments and just added some facts. I left it here rather than simply deleting it, because it serves as an easy way to find my real name, and as an example of ShockWave site, both relevant to the ShockWave entry in this Wiki. -- Ben Pitt.
