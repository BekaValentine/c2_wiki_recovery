The best defense against WikiSpam is IP blocking.

So, spammer put their wikispam software into worms, and send these into penetrated computers. Then those computers spam the wikis they see.

Also, they are beginning to provide Spam payloads containing no URLs, so the second best defense - bouncing edits with URLs, no longer works.

I hope I live to see the day when we look back and laugh about this D''''''isnformationEra. --PhlIp
