Add to the Resulting Context so that it names the next problems you are likely to encounter.  If your Resulting Contexts only says, "problem solved," you don't need a section for it.  On the other hand, if you say what the reader will next encounter, you have really added some information.  I have never yet seen a pattern that didn't raise or lead to new problems.  Ideally, they are smaller, that is idea, after all.   --AlistairCockburn
