John Faughnan is best described via http://www.faughnan.com.

I am not a software developer or manager, though I consult in medical informatics for a software company that is experimenting with XP. These days, I do knowledge representation and knowledge engineering work, which might actually mean something in my context.

I'm at this site mostly to play with wiki. I've been interested in collaborative software solutions for decades.
