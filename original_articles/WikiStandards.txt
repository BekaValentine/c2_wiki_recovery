Many people are likely to be put off when they attempt to move from one wiki to another because of the use of different wiki engines.  Standardizing text entry may make it easier to get people to adopt wikis.  Other discussions at some of the major wikis and WikiEngine development sites about this topic:

	* TWiki: http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/WikiStandards
	* The Meatball Wiki: http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiMarkupStandard
	* WikiCreole: proposed at WikiSym 2006
	* Wiki Standards at WikiSym -- http://www.wikisym.org/pipermail/wiki-standards/

I have just employed the WikiClone 'Tavi (http://tavi.sourceforge.net) for my new wiki on poetry, which uses ''some'' of the conventions used in this Wiki, but not all of them.

It would be convenient if there were editing standards available between all wikis.  Is this possible or practical?  Given people's lust for FeatureCreep, will wikis keep growing more feature rich and content poor?

I don't know - but WebStandards always seem like a good idea to me.

''You'll never get a standard. Everyone wants something specific for their application, unwilling to compromise and work without it. If you try to standardise then eventually it will turn into HTML. Or worse, XML.''

That does not mean that some people who have wikis, and desire to participate in schemes linking the pages in their wikis with others cannot do so using a mutually agreeable standard.
