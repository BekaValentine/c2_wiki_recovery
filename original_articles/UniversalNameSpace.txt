A desire exists for an Universal NameSpace.

Some believe it is an elusive PipeDream	
* S''''''cientificNames were designed as a structured hierarchical N''''''ameSpace.  
* Taxonomists are constantly rearranging the branches and renaming things, often without general agreement. 
* Librarians have different criteria for placing books in different parts of a N''''''ameSpace.
* N''''''ameSpaces will have to remain personal
** import the parts you agree with 
** modify the parts you believe need modification

Others believe it is achievable
* By integrating existing namespaces 
* By indexing existing information
* By linking and relating information based on content at various levels of classification from the highest general level through levels of specificity down to the level of individual sentences, phrases and C''''''lassifyingWords (such a W''''''ikiWords).
