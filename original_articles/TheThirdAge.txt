"The Third Age of the World: Magic and Science in the 21st Century" is a book, currently only available online, by AlanCarter, co-author of the ProgrammersStone and creator of ReciprocalityTheory. The book paints much the same picture as ReciprocalityTheory, but in a more linear form and with less technical detail. Carter seems to have been aiming for a more "pop science" feel.
