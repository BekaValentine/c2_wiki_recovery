2. Target Redmond

A report that U.S. intelligence officials think Islamic terrorists plan to attack Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, underscores just what a target-rich environment America can be. If the goal is to strike American entities that have a global presence, then Microsoft certainly fits the bill.

''This just in...the US DOJ has declared Linus Torvalds a suspected terrorist''


As a high-tech company Microsoft also represents modernity, progress, and change -- all anathema to fanatics with a zero-sum, medieval mind-set. And with annual revenue of $25 billion, Redmond is the seat of the kind of wealth that prompts envy and even hatred from a wide spectrum of people. In fact, an attack on Microsoft that resulted only in property damage might well be applauded in many "anti-globalist" circles.

Dotted across the U.S. are dozens more corporate targets that might appeal to those looking to strike at a well-known American brand. Nike, Coke, AOL Time Warner, McDonalds -- any of them might serve as a backdrop to make some broad, violent statement against American capitalism.
