I work for IBM in the WebSphere Business Integration Group in Europe and was previously a memeber of the Object Technology Practice in the UK, having previously worked for C.G.S. and having been concerned with OT since 1990ish.

I am particularly interested in understanding patterns that are concerned with the capture and dessimination of learning experiences from projects. Not just the what and how long... but the why?

If anyone else is interested in this (and/or FrankZappa!) my email address is: mailto:gary_mumford@rockbell.com
