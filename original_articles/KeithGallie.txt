"Live Free Or Die"

University of Illinois BSCS College of Engineering 1986

I have spent all of my career writing application code in the semi conductor industry. Progression NCR->ATT->Symbios Logic->Symbios->LSILogic (I never quit in this part of the progression, the company kept on changing under me) 

I left LSILogic to work for AMCC. AMCC promptly closed it's local office and I'm back at LSILogic.

I read the other day on here that someone said he writes code to make money to afford survival so he can write code.

I'm kind of the opposite. I write code so I can make money so I can do other things.

I tried to start a software company once. It was bringing in about 2K a month then I made some mistakes and it cratered.

UPDATE -> I work at AMD now.
