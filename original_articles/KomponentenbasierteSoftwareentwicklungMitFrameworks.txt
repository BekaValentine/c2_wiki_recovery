The introduction in the book states that it is a translation (from English). It would be nice if someone could provide a reference to the original.


I suspect it's a translation of 
''Framework Patterns'' (Management Briefings Series), published by SIGS Books & Multimedia in November 1996, [ISBN 1884842542].

I find it very strange that it would be a translation.  I reviewed a very early draft version of Framework Patterns, and my most important comment was that the English in it was not very good.  I always kind of suspected that WolfgangPree had written it initially in German, and then translated it himself...

I had the opportunity to ask WolfgangPree about it: The manuscript for KomponentenbasierteSoftwareentwicklungMitFrameworks was originally prepared in English, and published by SIGS, New York City, as ''Framework Patterns''. But then he found a German publisher, so the manuscript was translated back to German by a student.
