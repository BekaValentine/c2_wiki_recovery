A false customer is any person, process, or organization that you have to satisfy other than the users of the system you are developing.  When there is mistrust in a relationship, people will create FalseCustomers for developers in order to regain control.  

The thing to understand is that their intentions are often good.  They hope that 100% of what you do for the false customer will translate into value for the real customers, but they are often wrong.  In the worst cases, false customers will sap the strength of development and orphan the real customers.

Good development processes maximize alignment with the real customers and minimize or eradicate FalseCustomers.
