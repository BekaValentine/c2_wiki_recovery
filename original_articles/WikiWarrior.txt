An overzealous person who, in reference to his or her pet topic, removes criticisms and adds blindly positive commentary.  This is similar to astroturfing (i.e. a fake grassroots movement).

or better yet: Wiki''''''Wussy

(I initially put together this page after noticing a WikiWarrior with a penchant for RubyLanguage removing even mild criticisms of said language.)

----
''How can you say that?!?! There is no such thing as a '''mild''' criticism of Ruby! I demand satisfaction, sir!''

'''No, no!  Such a feeble paranoid, engaged in such un-Wiki like practices, does not deserve the honorific Warrior.  Seems more like an UnWikiWorrier to me!'''

''I see warrior as more of a sarcastic title in this case.  A WikiWarrior is not a self-assured person.''

Indeed; probably similar to the U.S. perjorative "Weekend Warrior" to describe military reservists.
