I'm a software developer, working mostly with JavaLanguage (and PythonLanguage whenever I can), and using some parts of ExtremeProgramming.

I'm currently living in Oxford, UnitedKingdom. Any Wiki contributors here?

At the moment, I'm learning J2ME so I can do interesting things with BlueTooth on my Palm.

My non-computer-oriented reading is largely ScienceFiction.
