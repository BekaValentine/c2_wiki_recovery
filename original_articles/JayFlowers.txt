I am a developer working at Northrop Grumman.  I have worked with Perl 5.6 and .NET 1.1.  I am currently working with VB.NET and C#.  At work I am working on a DistributedServiceBus.  Outside of work I am working on mbUnit and ASOGS.

So after much searching with no joy I have created the InternetRelayChat #Object on the F''''''reeNode network, irc.freenode.net.  I hope that others will join or let me know where an existing channel is.

Welcome to PeopleProjectsAndPatterns WardsWiki. If you have the energy you can help to improve MicrosoftDotNet related pages, such as DotNetFramework. How is "Distributed Service Bus" related to EnterpriseServiceBus, if at all? -- DavidLiu
