''Can't trust 'em. Can't get away from 'em.''

 Some people's hot
 Some people's cold
 Some people's not very
 Swift to behold
 Some people do it
 Some see right through it
 Some wear pyjamas
 If only they knew it
 The pyjamas people are boring me to pieces  --FrankZappa

Normal People is a wide term, and any one person may to another person seem like part of Normal People, at some given point in time. It is a commonly supposed phenomenon that anyone who is part of Normal People, will leave that group once you get to know them.
