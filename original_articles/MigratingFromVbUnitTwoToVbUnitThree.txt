'''Changes needed to migrate code from VBUnit2 to VbUnitThree described here:'''

Change startup program from your old vbUnit2 runner to "vbUnit3\bin\RunVBUnit.exe".

The ProgID changed from "VBUnit" to "VBUnit3".  Do one of...
	* Delete all "VBUnit." prefixes used to reference data types.
	* Global Replace of "VBUnit" with "VBUnit3".
Examples of existing usage:
  Private Sub IFixture_Setup(Assert As '''VBUnit'''.IAssert)
  Private Function ISuite_Suite() As '''VBUnit'''.ITest
Replace all...
	* "AssertEqualsString" with "StringsEqual"
	* "AssertEqualsLong" with "LongsEqual"
	* "AssertEqualsDouble" with "DoublesEqual"
	* "AssertEqualsVariant" with "VariantsEqual"
	* "m_Assert.Assert" with "m_Assert.Verify"
		* ''(Good luck trying to do a global replace on "Assert" that does not hit "m_Assert", "Debug.Assert" or "<object>.Assert =" ;-)''

In any Visual Basic project group files (*.vbg) that they may be in, eliminate the old vbUnit2 projects (and make your test project the startup project, with settings to run "RunVBUnit.exe" as shown above).
Delete from "vbg" files...
	* Project=..\..\VBUnitTestRunner\TestRunner.vbp
	* Project=..\..\VBUnitFramework\VBUnit.vbp
	* ''...and your own "Test Runner.vbp" -- which you won't need any more.''
