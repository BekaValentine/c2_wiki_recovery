The right to edit anything you can read. Somewhere in a land where no-one wears clothes, where all men acknowledge each other as brothers, where the only law is love, and do what thou will, where black is white and white is all colors, all creeds, all refactored and open, everyone is on the supreme court, everyone is pope, and everyone is president, FreedomOfWiki is the only right the law need guarantee.
