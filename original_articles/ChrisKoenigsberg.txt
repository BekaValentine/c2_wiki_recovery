Chris (Christopher K.) Koenigsberg

Been around forever (took "Intro to Programming in ALGOL-W" at CMU back in 1976, have been "ckk" on various Unix systems since 1978), mostly just have had the privilege to have known and worked with a lot of great people (they're all world famous, rich, retired, tenured professors, etc. by now, names deleted to protect the guilty, unless they forget to keep paying my protection fee) and I have learned a great deal from them and have lots of stories to tell (please wipe the drool off my chin), but still haven't accomplished any especially noteworthy thing under my own name (except for some good music here and there).

Have helped with and worked on some of the best projects ever (Andrew etc.), have also spectacularly failed on some medium-sized projects (apologies again to my friends at Whitehat), am succeeding now though.

I even met my wife <a href="http://nhn.ou.edu/~wang">Yun Wang</a> on the Net... back in 1988!
