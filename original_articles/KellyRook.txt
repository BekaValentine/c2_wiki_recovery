Upon my first post, which went something like this:

Okay, okay, so for those of you who aren't HpLovecraft fans, I'm trying to see what the general attitude is here on aliases and such. Every time I read a site that says, "it's so immature" I see another site that whole-heartedly embraces it. I'm a little put off by the apparent lack of other aliases here, but what the hey, unlike what you'll read in most Usenet etiquette FAQs, the general attitude here seems to be to jump in and play.

I received LamontCranston's post which I have moved to RealNamesPlease because I think it's an interesting response and I believe the ideas it brings deserve some more exploration.
