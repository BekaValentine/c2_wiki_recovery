A die-hard Mac and Smalltalk bigot, he has been applying object oriented techniques to multiple domains, from digital image analysis, to servo-motor control, to financial systems, in Smalltalk, C++, and now Java, since 1988.  Having been one of the PairProgramming skeptics during development of the VcapsProject at Ford, his development life was changed by DonWells (and other team members), and he is now a staunch advocate of everything ExtremeProgramming.

He is currently available for XP consulting opportunities after previously being a lead team member on a very ambitious, large team (approx. 30 developers) XP project at Interface Systems in Ann Arbor, Michigan (Go Buckeyes!).  He is also the current President of the MichiganExtremeProgrammingEnthusiasts group.
