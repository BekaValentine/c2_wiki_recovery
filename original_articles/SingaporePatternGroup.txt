Hi , It looks like there is not too many activity about design pattern here. I am learning pattern for last one year and will like to learn/share my experience.

If anyone in Singapore has interest or share my view, then we can meet at weekends and learn more about patterns.

Please e-mail me if anyone is interested: mailto:bhak@singnet.com.sg
