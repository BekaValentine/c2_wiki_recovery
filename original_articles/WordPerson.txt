We're all "wired" differently, and some of us are better described as a WordPerson, as opposed to a PicturePerson. I guess that's one reason I prefer a CommandLineInterface ("CLI") to a GraphicalUserInterface ("GUI"). - BillZimmerly

I'm also a WordPerson, and also prefer a CommandLineInterface.  For me, it is much much easier to use than a GraphicalUserInterface.  But I know most computer users don't feel that way.--ApoorvaMuralidhara

I think, that word versus picture is a BifurcationFallacy. Firstly you can be arbitrarily in between. And secondly you can be a RhythmPerson or a StructurePerson or a RelationshipPerson or a MotoricalPerson, depending on which MentalModule of your mind is the strongest resp. most trained. (See also HowTheMindWorks) --GunnarZarncke (a StructurePerson)
