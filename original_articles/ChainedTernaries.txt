UseCase:

You need to fork/exec a program. You need to pass CommandLine options based on variable bound information. You want to be concise.

Example:

 int main(int, char**)
 {
  int geometry = metrics::large;
  const char* args[] = {
    "program",   // arg0 is always the program name
    "-geometry", // specify the geometry
    false ? 0
     : metrics::large == geometry
     ? "1024x768"    
     : metrics::small == geometry
     ? "640x480"
     : "default",
    0};

  // error checking omitted for brevity
  execv(args[0], args);
  return 0;
 }

''Is it just me, or is this TooCleverByHalf?  I think the equivalent code without chained ternaries is just as readable.''

A collegue pointed out that it isn't the simplest possible thing, and that an IdiotProgrammer doing maintenance might not get it...
