Does anybody have an opinion on Microsoft's new "ribbon" interface for Office-2007? Is it an improvement, or a change for the sake of change?

'''No Movement'''

Someone pointed out the advantage of the ribbon not shifting all over the place like tool-bars used to in Office. But perhaps this could have been "fixed" by not making the tool bars shift all over the place in Office. It's sort of like, "I bought a new truck because there was a cadaver in the back of my car."

As displays become wider it does not seem like a good idea to have a ribbon that makes it more like you are viewing your document through a letter-box.

''Unless you have the option of putting it on the side.''
