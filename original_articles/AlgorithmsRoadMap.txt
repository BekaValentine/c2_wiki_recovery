For a good introduction on algorithms, see IntroductionToAlgorithms

Here are some of the pages on wiki that describe algorithms

----
'''Wiki-related algorithms'''

The following are really more like features than algorithms, but perhaps some of them use interesting algorithms to do the work.

* DiffAlgorithm -- This is how a function comparing two pages on wiki (or two files in general) could work. See WagnerFisherAlgorithm
* AddingNewPages -- How to create a wiki page.

----
'''Miscellaneous algorithms'''

* PerpetualCalendarAlgorithm -- A few lines of algorithm and a few lines of code and you will have any month after 1752 appear on the screen!
----
'''Uncategorized'''

* AlgorithmsWanted
* AnalysisOfAlgorithms
* AstarSearch
* DijkstrasAlgorithm
* GeneticAlgorithm
* GraphSinkDetection
* IntegerPowerAlgorithm
* TpkAlgorithm
* WagnerFisherAlgorithm

----
'''SortingAlgorithms'''

* http://c2.com/cgi/like?SelectionSort gives a page list.
