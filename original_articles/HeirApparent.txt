Management AntiPattern where the boss is perceived to have a chosen successor, who often makes their status publicly known.  Effectively lowers the glass ceiling by one floor.  Stimulates career progression by others through leaving the work group.  SuccessionPlanning is susceptible to this antipattern because it is smart to prepare a potential successor.  Avoid by having an open succession process which provides for a choice between multiple candidates.
