PHP: Hypertext Processor is a scripting language.  I personally prefer it over other languages for web development because of its clean integration with HTML.

''AllaireColdFusion has better HTML integration in my opinion.''

["HTML integration" is a bad idea.  HTML separation, recognition and generation are preferable because they facilitate team development and encourage SeparationOfConcerns.  See PhpGt for an example of how this should be done.]

EditHint: merge with PhpLanguage
