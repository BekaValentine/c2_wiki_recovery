Replacing a page with its machine translation is vandalism.

If you see non-English text, it must fit these guidelines:

	* the author added new text, and didn't replace with translation
	* the author knew the target language

Does anyone know the motivation for babelfishing pages? It doesn't seem to make sense except in a vandalism way, in which case, why go through the trouble of babelfishing when you can just trash it?
