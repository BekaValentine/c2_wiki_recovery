I have been writing software for about 20 years now.  I have coded in just about every common and semi-common programming language, platform, and operating environment.  These days, however, I find that for most programming tasks I turn to Perl, Haskell, Ruby, C++, bash, and sometimes Java, on some kind of Unix-like platform.  (I've been trying to avoid Windows for the last few years.)
