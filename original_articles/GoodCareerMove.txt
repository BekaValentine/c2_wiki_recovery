There's a longstanding story that some entertainment-industry player muttered this on hearing that ElvisPresley had died. If it did happen, then the mogul had a point: Elvis was one of many stars to receive an image (and sales) boost by dying an untimely death. Indeed it's often observed that there's a level of iconic fame that's largely open only to the dead, in particular those who die relatively young (and preferably in a dramatic fashion).
