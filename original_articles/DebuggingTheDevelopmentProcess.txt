I read this book years ago, found it very relevant, and still do. One interesting point is that the author emphasizes the idea that each feature should be fully implemented ''and'' fully debugged, before the developer(s) responsible for that feature move on to the next feature. I think this has a lot in common with agile methodologies - where the system developed feature-by-feature with continuous testing to ensure a low defect rate. -- JohnRusk

In fact, FeatureDrivenDevelopment is all about just that - working on getting the system built one feature at a time. -- BevanArps
