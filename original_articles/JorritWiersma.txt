Currently, I am a programmer at medium-sized J2EE developing company in the Netherlands.  I used to be a Dutch PhD student in astronomy.  I found c2 when surfing the web for information on Python and XML programming.  I successfully applied some of the XP practices to both my programming exploits and my academic work.  I have used CodeUnitTestFirst on my astrophysical research and it's going so fast! :-)  I'm still trying to fit XP into my work in the IT business.  The company I work with still adheres to some of the WaterFall ideas, but release schedules are pretty agile due to influences of DSDM.

I hope I can also contribute to the Wiki.
