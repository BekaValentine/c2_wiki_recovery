No longer JustaProgrammer, and I must admit I miss it sometimes.

'''Thoughts on WikiWikiWeb:'''
	* I haven't been active for a few years, but gained a lot of valuable insight during my travels here.  
	* I enjoy telling the story of this Wiki, as many people seem to assume WikiPedia is the one and only.
	* I support NoNamesPlease and might just start a WikiMindWipe. If we eliminate name-ownership it supports focus on creating a PositiveDialogueCommunity, and in the end I'd rather see the discussion advance than have people arguing over credit for who invented a thought first.
