CosAgile (COSXPUG) is a vendor-neutral forum for the sharing of ideas, experiences, and meeting XP related goals (i.e. this is not intended to be a forum for sales pitches). As such, we are looking for interested parties to present, share information and request information in its many forms from the users group. We are also interested in hearing about other agile processes, particularly in how they compare to XP, such as SCRUM, Adaptive Software Development, Crystal, and RationalUnifiedProcess.


'''On another note, share the knowledge'''

Knowing what ColoradoSpringsXpCompanies exist will benefit us all.
