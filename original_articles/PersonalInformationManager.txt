A tool for collecting and organizing personal information. So it provides fast and organized information access on personal information.

One day I was visiting Ward and looked over his shoulder as he was working in his PersonalWiki, and saw how he uses his WikiAsPim.  I was sold, and and now PIM is a large part of what's on my PersonalWiki.

Wiki techniques can prove to be beneficial in the development of a hyperlinked PersonalInformationManager.

Some efforts in this direction from several sources: 
----
'''Ed Taekema '''
* Uses ''M''''''oinMoin'' Wiki: -- http://www.pycs.net/users/0000177/2003/10/27.html#P54

'''Chandler''''''Pim'''
* Open Source Project which is presently funded by a 2.75 million dollar grant (4th Quarter 2003) for the purpose of scaling Chandler to that of a Campus Wide system.
* A Personal Information Manager (PIM) intended for use in everyday information and communication tasks, such as composing and reading email, managing an appointment calendar and keeping a contact list. 
*Because of the ease with which Chandler users can share information with others, Chandler might be called the first Interpersonal Information Manager.

I used to love Lotus Agenda (yeah, way back in the days of DOS), but naturally as with all of Lotus products they are now defunct.

A few years ago I wrote a simplified Windows .Net replacement version, available as shareware here:

''Thanks for sharing this with us. It looks like you did this in 2006 or so, have you or do you intend to do more with this?''
