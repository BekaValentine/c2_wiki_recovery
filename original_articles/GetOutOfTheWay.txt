From GuruingByWalkingAround...

Clear up blocks of time where you can walk around the hallways, being sociable and saying "hello" to people. Don't start-off by thrusting your superior knowledge and expertise upon them. You can come off as too cocky and arrogant. Try to be helpful rather than forceful. If you manage to bring the conversation toward some problem they are having, take a look at and offer some possible suggestions and solutions (don't offer "the solution" - cocky and arrogant again ;-) 

You have to be careful not to come off as the grand wizard who is being so gracious as to bother assisting the helpless peons who know nothing compared to you. You don't necessarily have to wait to offer help until you are asked, but you probably do need to wait until they start complaining about a problem.
