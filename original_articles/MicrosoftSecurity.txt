''Note in a Jul04 article Bill is said to have revealed that a third of MicrosoftCorporation R&D budget is spent on security improvements.''

(The other 2/3 is spent creating new holes :-)

'''"Night and Day Difference" in security  (in SP2 release of WindowsXp)'''

So said BillGates in Nov03 (see http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=16101330).

The ''WindowsXp SP2'' is now released and can be found at GetItFirstFromHere. I am hoping we are changing into the day, from night. The reverse is unthinkable
* SP2 may have arrived too late for older machines. See http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,95513,00.html

'''PalladiumDiscussion After MicrosoftPalladium''''''demise '''

The original security solution, NextGenerationSecureComputingBase, was code named Palladium and started with a partnership with Intel in 2002, as part of TrustworthyComputing initiative. In May04 it was confirmed the project is canned as WindowsXp has chosen a different hardware mechanism to improve security. See http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/dailyarchives.jhtml?articleId=18841713&_requestid=224457

The above article said there will be announcements at end 2004 on what technologies from MicrosoftPalladium will be incorporated into WindowsLonghorn.

''Note it appear at least some of MicrosoftPalladium work went into DigitalRightsManagement implementations, as at early 2005''.

'''Implementation aspects'''

Microsoft implements crytography mechanisms for SecureSocketsLayer in the MicrosoftWindows, subsequently when a flaw is found, all OS versions (e.g. WindowsTwoThousand) are affected. See http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/holes/story/0,10801,73507,00.html. In Jul04 SSL security flaws are still affecting companies that use SSL on MicrosoftWindowsServer

''Microsoft Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)''

This is used ?only in KerberosProtocol

''Is it another way to push Microsoft users to using DotNet and newer OS on servers and clients? It has been mentioned that WindowsServerTwoThousandThree is supposed to be more secure than WindowsTwoThousand.''

''Anyone got specifics on significant security advantages of Windows 2003 over W2K, in manners that WindowsTwoThousand cannot be improved by using third party products.''

There aren't too many of these. A major change in WIndows 2003 is that things are not installed or are turned off out of the box, so its default state is more secure.

'''Raw Socket debate'''

WindowsXp Service pack 2 included a block against use of raw sockets, which are heavily used by tools used by security people, as well as hackers with undetermined intent. A bypass was found, and then the "hole" was plugged again in Apr05 MS patch. It was claimed vendors of other OS did not find it necessary to take this drastic step.

MS appear to have suggested the patch did not apply to WindowsServerTwoThousandThree, and that while DOS attacks are still possible through kernel attachments (even with the patch), such increased sophisticated work causes more serious concerns than DOS attacks, and are challenging to create.

'''Significant critics to MicrosoftSecurity'''

''Windows security is a CatastrophicSuccess. Seriously, is there any such thing as Windows security?''

Responding to TrustworthyComputing, BruceSchneier repeated call for MS to withdraw the SoapProtocol offering, and affirmed his previous stance on problems.
* original newsletter at http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0006.html
* at 2004 still find webpages on security linking to remarks by Bruce

''NMap port scanner disabled by MS05-019 patch issued Apr05''

NMap was deemed to be a highly important port scanning tool that rely on use of raw sockets. Since Apr05 patch (?even non SP2) MS PC users were stopped from using raw sockets. Some claimed without a tool like this, legitimate users have no means to get at the extra data.

See also a patch for the patch (problem is "host ignoring ICMP Destination") at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=898060

'''Tracing?'''

Does anybody know how to trace why a particular authentication fails? As things grow more complex and security grows in concern, there seems to be the need for a tool or technique that logs and describes why a particular authentication event failed. One needs to know the "rule that it bumped into". It's a bloody '''black box''' right now.
