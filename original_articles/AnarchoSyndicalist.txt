Technically, anarcho-syndicalism is only one of three different types of anarchism. We exclude "anarcho"-capitalists since they have not the least claim on the Anarchist movement or any of its founders. Also, before right-libertarianism (aka "anarcho"-capitalism) was invented a mere couple decades ago, the term libertarian was a synonym of anarchist.

Now, in practice nobody cares about the distinction between the three different types of Anarchism. At best, they have different emphasis arising from different points of view. At worst, they're divisive. The term Anarcho-Syndicalism is usually used to explicitly exclude capitalists running just another PR scam. Many resent having to make any such concession (including the authors of AnAnarchistFaq) so Anarcho-Syndicalism is something of a misnomer.
