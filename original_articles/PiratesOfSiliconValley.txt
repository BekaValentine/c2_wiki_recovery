A movie about the rise of AppleComputer mostly, counterpointed with the rise of MicrosoftCorporation as a contrast. Funny, sad and inspiring.

Did anyone see the movie ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' Sunday evening?
I really enjoyed it. I have to admit, Bill is interesting. Will COM persist or will the blue meanies tear it down so we can all start over again?

''While the portrayal of SteveJobs seemed pretty fair, the BillGates bits were mostly whitewash. Bill as clueless roller-geek failing to pick up women ... um, yeah.''

Could Bill have, by any chance, owned the parent of the parent of the production company that did POSV?

''You have to remember POSV was based on FireInTheValley which was partially written by MichaelSwaine, an avid Apple booster. He despises BillGates and has a love-hate thing for SteveJobs. Notice how MicrosoftCorporation was just portrayed as comical until they interacted with Apple. Apple had much more depth. Anyway, I laughed so hard at SteveBallmer and BillGates' slouch. This movie is too funny. Go rent it.''

I went to rent it from a mainstream movie rental joint while working on a programming contract in Silicon Valley, the heart of the incidences portrayed. Strangely, they didn't carry it. (This was before eMovies were practical.) I wonder if "Bugsy" is missing in Vegas also.

I eventually saw it, and the "broke into rich neighbor's house" argument scene between Jobs and Gates near the end is a classic. Clever ending also. The "IBM virgin" scene is right up there also.

Do you think the woman at the Xerox lab [XeroxParc?] was supposed to be AdeleGoldberg?

''That was my take at least -- my wife thought I had blown a gasket when I started pointing at the screen and laughing hysterically when we saw the movie.''
