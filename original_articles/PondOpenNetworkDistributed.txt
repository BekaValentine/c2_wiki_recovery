Take the internet, and wrap it up as a giant Storage Area Network with the ability to create virtual machines or desktops on the fly.  
* Store your files everywhere, and nowhere all at once.  
* Distribute the burden of processing everywhere at once 
** share your system with everyone
** everyone shares their system with you.

Encryption, naming services, even a whole 'nother network on top of the current internet.. Wiki stands as possibly the new hyper-text interface.
