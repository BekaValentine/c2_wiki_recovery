----------
Wishlist:
	* allow addition of user-specific columns (to be used in site-specific metrics). Things like "Workorder Number" and "Feature type" (product or infrastructure) are things I have added to my own spreadsheet, for later correlation with other systems at my workplace. Being my first sprint, I've already added a dozen columns to help us measure the benefits of using Scrum vs. our other ways of working. Hopefully, they'll disappear over time... -- DebHartmann July 19, 2003

Doesn't do everything you mention, but you might like to take a look at http://scrumwiki.org/ (Nov 11 2003)

Also doesn't do everything above, but we're using Outreach Project Tool at work.
Sourceforge Project Page: http://www.sf.net/projects/outreach/
It's open-source PHP and can be easily extended.
