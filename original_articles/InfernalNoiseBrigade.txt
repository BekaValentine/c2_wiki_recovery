I'm not usually one for posting musician type pages, but I was wondering if anyone knew about or wanted to discuss the InfernalNoiseBrigade.

Evidentally they are "a cross between a band and a protest" - Appearing in places like Seattle - and soon in New York for the Republican convention.

I haven't seen them personally, but I've had first hand reports that it is quite a spectacle - easily attracting the attention of an entire city.
