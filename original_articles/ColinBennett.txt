I'm a Java, Linux, HTML, C++, and Perl hacker, who also happens to have an interest in just about everything else under the sun, including any hi-tech gadgets, new gizmos for my mountain bike, ham radios, fast cars, and so on.

This is my first Wiki page!  Thanks to JohnGoodsen for telling me about it and pointing me to this server.

Colin, How are you involved in HamRadio? If licensed, what call-letters?
