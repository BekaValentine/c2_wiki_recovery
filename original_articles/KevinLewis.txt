Kevin is a software developer that has to be an architect most of the time, even though he'd rather lay code.

Kevin is a Microsoft Certified Architect (http://msdn.microsoft.com/architecture/shareideas/share_certified/), though most of his work is in Java-related technologies.

Kevin likes software (mostly coding), and ideas from things totally unrelated to software that end up having a lot to do with software.

A couple of them are:
