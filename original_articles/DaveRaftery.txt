I have been using Wikis for two years.  Thank you Ward for this wonderful technology. I was using WikiServer on my machine at home.  Now I have switched to NoteStudio which runs on both a PC and Palm OS.  I am running 2 wikis on our intranet at work: UseModWiki and SqueakSwiki implementations.

I have Ward and Bo's book TheWikiWay, and have played a little with simple modifications to the QuickiWiki program, included with the book.  This is an excellent book for WikiZens.

I have been slowly teaching myself Smalltalk for about a year now, using SqueakSmalltalk.

I also have a homepage at http://rafteryfamily.swiki.net/1   This is a commercial wiki site which will allow you to create free wiki pages.
