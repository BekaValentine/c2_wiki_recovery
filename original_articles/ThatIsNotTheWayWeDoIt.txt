This is a complaint we here for the folks who are usually satisfies and who say such things as:
* If it aint broke, don't fix it
* We've always done it like this
* You're just reinventing the wheel
* How is this better?
* ... add more here
* ...

It is a statement which one must consider as a potential argument against whatever needs to be done better and in a different way.

''How is this better?''

Actually, that's a very reasonable and prudent question. Exactly how ''is'' this better than what we're doing now? Different isn't better because it's different.
