I would like to raise a question: is bad coding the fault of bad developers or managers who allow, even encourage, it to happen? Some say that coders should "do it right" even if there is no incentive or disincentive, but I am not sure I agree with this. --AnonCreator

Is anything one person's fault? one department or positions? I don't mean to imply that you aren't onto something here but rather to suggest that events and products are more ummm co-emergent. --BenTremblay
