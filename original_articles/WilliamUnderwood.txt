Just a naive programmer from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Give me a shout some time, if you wanna talk patterns, programming or whatever... it's not like I sleep these days anyway :)

		* In person - Saskatoon, Saskatchewan - let me know you're coming, 
		* Telephone - (306)251-0744 - oh, go on, what's a long distance call for a couple minutes worth anyhow?
		* My Computer - http://cwillu.com - Post on the wiki there, if you see something weird (and maybe wonderful?) then play around with it.  (assuming, of course, that my server is in good shape despite me being 2 feet away from it... oh well)
		* Email - cwillu@cwillu.com (I've given up on the spam war for now) - get's checked more often than this page these days.  (Note that cwillu@sasktel.net comes and goes;  best to use the gmail address)
		* Wiki - http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?edit=WilliamUnderwood - but this not the most reliable manner of reaching me.

Be aware that I occasionally use the short form of 'cwillu' rather than repeating W''''''illiamUnderwood many times over, just so ya' know.  And like MichaelBolton, I'm not related... (there's a reason I don't typically use my first name online :p)
