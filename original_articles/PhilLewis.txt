''Phil, AreYouThere? [October 18, 2003 - November 15, 2001]''

Currently working for KnowledgeManagementSoftware in Manchester, UK.

I saw KentBeck at Application Development 99. I was impressed by the ideas (this was the first time I'd met Xp), but unfortunately, I was an ArdentDuffer at this time, and highly skeptical about Xp.

Times change, and nearly a year ago, we decided to pilot Xp, and saw that it was a Good Thing. So eight months ago we started in earnest, and now we would not ever think about looking back.

A bit about me.

I worked in theatre as a stage manager before rediscovering computers a few years ago. I do other things as well, notably TaiChi (Chen and Peking). I have mad crazes about things, currently photography. No doubt the minute I convince my wife we need a darkroom, my passion (for photography, not my wife) will be directed elsewhere.

However, it is a sad fact that I just love writing software, and actually count that as my main hobby.
