	 :	"The book was compelling because many of the attributes of today's managers, and organizations in general, can STILL be applied to either Theory X or Theory Y management types! In fact, much of the literature today suggests that companies with a Theory Y mindset are surviving better today than Theory X companies. The supporting information Mc''''''Gregor provides to each theory suggests, again even today, that these two themes will be prevalent in society for years to come.

	 :	"Having this book in your professional library will provide you with some good insight and historical reference to modern day theories."
