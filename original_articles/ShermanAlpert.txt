Hi! I'm a Sr. Software Engineer at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center (http://www.watson.ibm.com).

I've been programming in Smalltalk and doing object-oriented stuff since 1987. Before that, I consulted for big banks on Wall Street as well as other clients. Lately (circa 1998), I've been coding in Java too. Recently, I refactored a standalone Smalltalk app into a Java/Smalltalk client/server solution: the bulk of the infrastructure of the app still lives in a (server-ized) Smalltalk app and users interact with a Java client.

I've recently (1998) published the DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion with KyleBrown and BobbyWoolf. It's a follow-on to the GangOfFour DesignPatterns book, but here the patterns are viewed through Smalltalk glasses.

I'm on the Editorial Boards of the journal Multimedia Tools and Applications and the Journal of Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia and here are some other professional activities of mine:
 
 Conference Committee (Tutorials Chair), OOPSLA 2002
 Conference Committee (Communications Chair), OOPSLA 2000  
 Program Committee, ICME 2002, IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo  
 Program Committee, ICME 2001  
 Program Committee, ICME 2000  
 Program Committee, IEEE Multimedia Systems'99
 Specialist Reviewer, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education
 Executive Peer-Reviewer, Educational Technology & Society
 Review Board, Intl J. of Web-Based Communities
 Reviewer, IEEE MultiMedia

I have a BS in Computer Science (State University of New York at Stony Brook), a Masters in Computing in Education (Columbia University Teachers College).
