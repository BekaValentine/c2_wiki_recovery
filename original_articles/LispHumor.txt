 (eq today (car (cdr life)))
-- (Author unknown)

CommonLisp has other ways of saying '''car''' and '''cdr''' that, according
to taste, either wreck that joke or clarify it.

[''For example:''
 (eq today (first (rest your-life))) 
- JayOsako]

You can still say '''car''' and '''cdr''', though... I think, by the way, that
I prefer

 (eq today (car (cdr (life you))))

'''Q:''' How many Lisp programmers does it take to change a lightbulb?

'''A:''' A whole CAR full.

When my first wife left me, she took everything. The kids, the house, the car. She didn't even leave me the cdr!

One day a student came to Moon and said: "I understand how to make a
better garbage collector. We must keep a reference count of the
pointers to each ''cons''."

Moon patiently told the student the following story:
