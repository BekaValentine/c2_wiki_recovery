ItsNotMyWiki is the understanding that a wiki is held and owned by no one in particular.  Understanding this helps people think of the good of the community rather than the good of oneself.  It's a good thing to keep this in mind when you go around the Wiki, to stop from becoming WikiGremlin, and instead become a WikiGnome.
