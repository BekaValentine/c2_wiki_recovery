I'm a SmallTalk and Ruby geek. I started the SeattleRubyBrigade (Seattle.rb) and continue to run it. I've got a major thing for object systems / ontologies, languages, and interpreters. I've worked at GemStone, Amazon, Omni Group, and am now consulting doing ruby and rails gigs.

I worked with CorwinLightWilliams at all three locations above. I left Amazon feeling dirty, abused, and rather stale skill-wise. I spent three months afterwards coding like mad and not really wanting to stop. It was nice, and fairly cheap really... You should try it. Good therapy. I wrote an interpreter a week for 8 weeks. It was lovely. I even wrote a lisp interpreter in pascal!

I think ''The School of Niklaus Wirth, The Art of Simplicity'' (ISBN 1558607234) is one of the most inspiring books I've read in a long time. I re-read the book every summer.

I maintain a website at http://www.ZenSpider.com/ and a blog at http://blog.zenspider.com/
