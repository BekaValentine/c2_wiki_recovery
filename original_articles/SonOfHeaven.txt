''Continuing and tranquil is the Son of Heaven!'' -- http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/moerman/v2002/read_questions/bronze_pan_inscription.html

Classic epithet for the Emperor of China. A fortuitous blend of Buddhism and Confucianism: the Emperor is the still center and by his stillness spreads harmony throughout the empire. Meanwhile, back at the Realpolitik Ranch, the mandarins run the country.
