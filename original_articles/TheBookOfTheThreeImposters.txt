This book was supposed to have blasphemously disproven the
teachings of Jesus, Moses & Mohammed. It was famous in the
Middle Ages ("De Tribus Impostoribus"--attributed at times 
to Frederick III) ...then Arthur Machen finally wrote a book 
with this title (an excellent book, but one that has nothing 
to do with the legend).
