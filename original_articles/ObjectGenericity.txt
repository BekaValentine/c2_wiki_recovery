ObjectGenericity is the ability to forge classes of the same algorithm with different types, without cutting and pasting, and without casting. CeePlusPlus does this with templates.

DelphiLanguage has no native facility for this, unlike AdaLanguage and CeePlusPlus. (JavaLanguage is currently contemplating the feature). However, Delphi's namespace-like unit scoping rules in combination with the include facility can provide a very passable rendition.
