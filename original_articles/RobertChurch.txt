Hi. I'm RobertChurch. I live in PortlandOregon, and I'm currently writing Linux and FreeBSD kernel code and hacking Perl and things as part of an appliance. My after-hours programming is in Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Smalltalk, and I'm increasingly interested in virtual machines and assembly languages.

No relation to AlonzoChurch.

I first came here in May of 2000, or thereabouts, because I had an interest in XP, and I've learned tons about XP here, and innumerable other fascinating things.
