Hey there and how goes it!
I have yet to check all the links on Wiki out, don't have That much time on my hands. I was bidding on a freelance job where the question (one of many) was '''''Are you familiar with WikiForums'''''. I had no idea what she was talking about, than started thinking ''man guess I'm getting out of touch''. Now other folks out there would probably include other comments on that as well...but with a quick google here I am and here I've been.
--I was surfing a few links and came across a pretty cool discussion from two guys and a girl here: BadThing.

Guess that wraps it till I'm bored again, I mean after all ''Happy Hour'' is now over. Beautiful day gota say 80â˜¼ on Feb 26t
