SmalltalkThreeDee:
*	no text, no means of adding text at all
*	no particles
*	horribly braindead framework based on know-it-all render managers
*	relatively low frame rates
*	requires voodoo programming, for example
**	mounting the light on a camera makes every rendered object flat
**	putting a blank Part between the camera and the sceneRoot screws up its position and orientation for no reason

TrueVison3D:
*	the texture editor crashes within 30 seconds! But then again, it doesn't seem to do anything useful in the first place.
*	the material editor doesn't seem to do anything useful.
*	no geometry or part editors at all, no visible means to import parts.
*	generates crappy C++ code. Only generates C++ code.
*	where're the tutorials?
*	has a neat particle engine
*	wish I could figure out how to use text, oh that's right I still haven't figured out how to use anything at all
