ObjectIcon is from Robert Parlett and is available at http://code.google.com/p/objecticon

Instead of Icon icont and iconx this O-O ICON interprets and compiles with oit and oix.

Is largely compatible with ICON 9.4

The major difference from UNICON is that this variant offers UNICODE strings asa a data type (ICON never had a char value type.)
