''The Openness Of God - A Biblical Challenge to the Traditional Understanding of God'' by Clark Pinnock et al 1994 [ISBN 0830818529]

Ground-breaking book presenting "a careful and full-orbed argument that the God known through Christ desires 'responsive relationship' with his creatures. While it rejects process theology, the book asserts that such classical doctrines as God's immutability, impassibility and foreknowledge demand reconsideration."

I couldn't put it down, even though I had agreed with its central premises for over twenty years. YourMileageMayVary of course but I think it could genuinely be of interest to thinking non-Christians on Wiki. -- RichardDrake

''How does it relate to BigOmega?'' It's a open question.

''As opposed to non-thinking Christians, no doubt. ;>''

Yes, that often seems to be the line up. Thinking non-Christians opposing non-thinking Christians. Once you bring the other two quadrants into play I think that the whole game becomes a lot more interesting.

I was struck to see from Amazon that well known "Reformed" publishing houses not renowned for innovation are busy enabling some high quality thinkers fill out the ''Openness'' thesis. Meantime I'm told by friends that there's an even more foundational shift happening across many disciplines centered on the key role of "narrative" in theology, philosophy, linguistics, the arts and sciences. I have a lot to catch up on. But the way I see it, something really earth shaking is happening in mainstream Christian theology, of a kind that most generations in the last 2000 years haven't had the privilege of witnessing. The best analogy in science would be the success of plate tectonics in geology to explain continental drift and a whole bunch of other stuff in the 1960s (which is also a good analogy for how fast foundational theology normally moves). Make sure you don't miss the action. -- rd
