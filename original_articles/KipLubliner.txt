Hi, I've been lurking on WikiWikiWeb for a while. It's about time that I make my own page. Or someone else's page, that is. 
I'm a recent graduate of JohnsHopkinsUniversity. I am about to move to Connecticut, to work for HyperionSolutions. My web page is at http://www.acm.jhu.edu/~kip/.

Right now my programming language of choice is PerlLanguage, but I think its too big and hairy for the real world. 

Some interesting WikiPage''''''s:
