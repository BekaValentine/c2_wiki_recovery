Many people have expressed concerns about the terms of the SoftwareLicense associated with ShrinkWrapped software.  Unlike most purchased products, where you own and are responsible for what you have paid your hard-earned dollars for, manufacturers of software believe that they can bind you to certain UseRestrictions by putting words in ink on the outside of a box containing software.
