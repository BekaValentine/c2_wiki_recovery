The AbsentProxy pattern, where the proxy is mutiny. 

For example, when extending guidance to a colleague, instead of claiming dominance using the RoyalWe ("our boss wants us to upgrade our UnitTest''''''s like this..."), you might say, "Our boss wrote the UnitTest module like this, but I think we can write the cases faster if we do them like this. But don't tell him we changed his test module!"

Whether this technique serves to piss off said boss remains to be seen.
