To add an AntiPattern to the AntiPatternsCatalog, you can:
* Browse the AntiPatternsCatalog to determine if the AntiPattern does not already exist.
* Create a page with the AntiPattern description using the AntiPatternTemplate.
* Add the appropriate category to the page. The available categories are CategoryAntiPattern (very general), CategoryArchitectureAntiPattern, CategoryDevelopmentAntiPattern and CategoryManagementAntiPattern (those three are subcategories of CategoryAntiPattern). To do that, just add at the bottom of the page for instance:
----
CategoryManagementAntiPattern
----
* Manage the cross references. Ideally, if you want your pattern to be found, you should reference it 3 times (huuu, I know this is quite heavy).
** Add the NewAntiPattern to the alphabetical listing in the AntiPatternsCatalog page.
** Add the NewAntiPattern to the category listing in the AntiPatternsCatalog page.
** Add the NewAntiPattern to the category listing in the appropriate RoadMap page which offers a more detailed level of classification. You can choose betweeen ArchitectureAntiPatternRoadMap, DevelopmentAntiPatternRoadMap and ManagementAntiPatternRoadMap.
