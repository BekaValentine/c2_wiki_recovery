A refactoring technique being tried on SmalltalkInsteadOfPython and ClosureInsteadOfObject. The technique consists of 4 steps:

	0 conduct a threaded discussion
	0 when the thread cools, add a TentativeSummary section at the bottom of the page
	0 when people stop altering that section, move it to the top of the page 
	0 refactor the page to reflect the summary.

If the TentativeSummary bursts, and threads begin anew, delete the phrase '''Tentative Summary''' and wait for cooling again.

'''Example:'''

Foo is great!

''Foo is bad!''

Perhaps only people like you don't like Foo.

''People who like Foo are scum!''

What kind of people are scum?

''Bar people! The Bar people are scum!''

A typical Bletch comment.

'''TentativeSummary'''

Bar people really like Foo. Bletch people really don't. Be careful and diplomatic in what you say about Foo, Bar and Bletch, because this seems to be a religious issue.

'''Discussion:'''

"when people stop altering that section, move it to the top of the page ''or before?''"

I think doing it right away is best. Casual readers get to see the summary right away and authors know where to find it. I also think that it's a good idea to pull thread-mode comments out of the main body as soon as possible. -- PhilGoodwin

I agree; so long as the conversation actually has cooled, the summary may as well be up top. If moving it to the top re-initiates things, well just fine. (Of course, in that scenario, the question arises concerning leaving it at the top or moving it down, ne? -- BenTremblay

I suppose that adding the summary to the bottom allows you to do it even earlier. When the discussion has slowed down but is still active, a tentative summary at the bottom is still kind of part of the thread, like in "I would summarise the past discussion like this. What do you think?".
However, when the discussion has really come to an end, adding the tentative summary to the bottom makes no sense. You want to summarise the discussion not revive it.
