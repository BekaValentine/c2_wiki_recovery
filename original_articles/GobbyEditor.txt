Gobby (http://gobby.0x539.de) is a collaborative editor (like SubEthaEdit) that runs on LinuxOS, WindowsOS and MacOsx. It's OpenSource FreeSoftware, released under the GPL. Uses GTK and the Infinote protocol (http://infinote.org/). Has a built in chat so you can talk OutOfBand. There's a GPL infinoted server at http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/wiki/Infinote/Infinoted so you can set up your own Gobby.
