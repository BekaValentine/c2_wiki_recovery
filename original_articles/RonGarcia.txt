Howdy.  I'm a student at the University of Notre Dame.  I just completed a M.S. in  Electrical Engineering, and am now pursuing a Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering.

I'm very interested in software engineering practices.  Specifically, I have been studying DesignPatterns and practicing Object Oriented Programming

I'm also very interested in the process of training effective software developers and project leaders -- ie, what skills/attitudes should be instilled in both of the above to make them effective.

I've recently been reading a lot about ExtremeProgramming, and have begun to implement some of the prescribed practices in my C++ development. I'm learning a great amount about the process of mapping XP-style development practices to C++. perhaps I'll write some of them up someday...

My primary language at this time is C++, which I have spent the last 1.5 years studying rather intently.
