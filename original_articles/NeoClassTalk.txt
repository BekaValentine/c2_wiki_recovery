A New Smalltalk Kernel Allowing Both Explicit and Implicit Metaclass Programming

NeoClassTalk, a new class/metaclass kernel for Smalltalk that is based on explicit metaclasses. 

In this system, end-users still deal with implicit metaclasses, but the full expressiveness of explicit metaclasses is provided to language designers. Dealing with explicit metaclass programming, NeoClassTalk proposes a new framework allowing dynamic composition of class properties such as MessageTracing, pre/post conditions, and Singleton instances.
