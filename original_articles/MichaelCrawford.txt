His middle initial is D but MichaelDCrawford does not pass the RegularExpression test for a link in this wiki.

Hi this is Mike, able to edit my page now.

I use Michael D Crawford always in my name to distinguish myself from the actor Michael Crawford, who starred in the London production of Phantom of the Opera.  I frequently get email from mistaken female admirers (some much older than I, and some so young I must reply to their mothers about their mistake), and sometimes I am accused of being an impostor.  I was born with the name, while the actor changed his for the stage.

But my regular job is as a software consultant.  I am president and chief bottle-washer of GoingWare Inc. at http://www.goingware.com

In person I'm a friendly and mild mannered person but I like to raise hell on the net by writing strongly opinioned web pages and mailing list posts.  You'll find some on my sites above.

New - I'm collecting my HellRaising together at a central place where you can find the for ready reference.  Please see http://www.goingware.com/manifestoes
