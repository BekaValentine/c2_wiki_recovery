I'm Ananda Sim. I am a consultant, developer, trainer working with MicrosoftAccess, MicrosoftExcel, VisualBasicForApplications, ActiveServerPages, AspDotNet, MacromediaColdFusion, MicrosoftSqlServer.

Recently, I've been interested in UmlDiagram''''''s, ObjectRoleModelling.

In cases where the modelling tool breaks my train of thought, I go for the simpler tools - Outliners like Tree''''''Pad (see http://www.treepad.com) and Natara Bonsai (see http://www.natara.com), MindMap''''''ping tools like Inspiration Software (see http://www.inspiration.com/home.cfm) (although it's not as fast as an Outliner) and associative mappers like PersonalBrain (http://www.thebrain.com/lowbrow/default.htm).

I'm really keen on Info''''Central - http://members.aol.com/mkoenecke/InfoCentral/whyic.html (an object based general purpose tool), but this is no longer a supported Corel product.
