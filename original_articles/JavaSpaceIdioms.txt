This page lists various JavaSpace patterns and idioms. Most of them are just being moved over from http://www.cdegroot.com/cgi-bin/jini as there has been a lot of vandalism there and I think the stuff should be preserved and exposed to a wider audience.

JavaSpaces puts you in a programming mode that is quite different from what you're used (AssociativeMemory), and in some ways the transition may be bigger than the one from procedural to object-oriented computing. Furthermore, it is a pretty low-level implementation of TupleSpace (only "equals" as a matching operator, for starters), and you need unique solutions to solve your problems.

This part of the Wiki tries to help you by collecting patterns and idioms for JavaSpaces design problems. Patterns need discussion, pondering, shaving, so please participate!
