A proposed category to unite topics about "discomfort" regarding web UI/GUI standards and practices. -t

Compare to CategoryOopDiscomfort in terms of category purpose. The word "Discomfort" avoids a value judgement of the technology itself (good versus bad), letting the topics carry the weight of value judgements. -t

However, perhaps a way is needed to distinguish between user discomfort (sore fingers etc.) and developer discomfort (vendor differences, etc.). Perhaps CategoryWebGuiStandardsDiscomfort? Other suggestions welcome. -t
