In GoodLanguageDesign it is controversically argued, that ProgrammingLanguage''''''s should provide a minimal cover of functionality. 

I think, that the FormFollowsFunction metapher from ArchitecturalDesign has something to this discussion.

Should the form (i.e. syntax) of a programming language follow its function? Probably yes.

But how about its semantics? Is that still form or already function?

Can we see here a connection to DesignPatterns? After all FormFollowsFunction is a DesignPattern in architecture.
