One of the last remaining unregistered adjective-noun domain names remaining after the dot-com bubble. I suppose the imagery is self explanatory... it's a sort of cube thingy (much like a RubiksCube I suppose) that has a compass on each of its 6 sides... probably used by Gandalf in middle earth for navigation. ;-) 

Well, not really. Cubic Compass is a portal software company in Portland, Oregon, US that uses ExtremeProgramming and the DotNet architecture.   -- MichaelLeach

"One of the last remaining", indeed.  One of the last remaining sensible ones, ''maybe''.  Sounds like a cool-looking gadget though.

''Hmmm....  http://www.CubicCompass.com just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it.  I think I'll go register it.  ;->''

Umm...folks...from where I sit, http://www.cubiccompass.com already is registered, and is an active business.  It appears to have been registered for quite some time now.
