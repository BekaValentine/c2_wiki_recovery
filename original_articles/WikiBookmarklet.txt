... is a BookMarklet that enhances the usability of this Wiki.

To give them a try simply use the "javascript:..." lines as the URL for a bookmark in your toolbar.  (See BookMarklet''''''s or http://www.bookmarklets.com for more details)

Wiki bookmarklets available:
	* WikiGoBookmarklet - Highly recommended.  Many-purpose.
	* EditPageBookmarklet - Redundant, if you don't mind clicking "Edit" at the bottom of the WikiPage. (I made this thinking it might be handier.  Some might feel that it is, though, after using it for a while, I decided that hitting "End" then clicking the edit link was just as good.)
	* QuickDiffBookmarklet - Redundant, if you don't mind clicking the date at the bottom of the WikiPage for diffs. (I made this before I found out about that feature)
	* WikiFindBookmarklet - Redundant, if you use the WikiGoBookmarklet and type "search=..."
	* WikiSelectBookmarklet - View wiki page whose name is highlightted (useful for viewing pages listed by LikePages).

Hmmmm. With Mozilla 0.9 the Bookmarklets are slightly broken. At least in the way I use it: If I click on the QuickDiffBookmarklet I get to the QuickDiff, but I cannot go back (Alt+Left) to the original page. I can still click on the title, but I miss the old behavior in other places too. Looks like the QuickDiff replaced the original page in the history. Bug or feature? Did anybody already adjust their bookmarklets to this behavior?
