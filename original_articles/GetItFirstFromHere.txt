'''Get Microsoft WindowsXp SP2''' via site listed in http://p2pnet.net/story/2118

 12Aug04 Will merge with WindowsXp page by end Aug04

''Windows XP Service Pack 2 Network Installation Package for IT Professionals and Developers'' is the title of the MS site listed above.

'''Be warned of possible compatibility problems with older (and some newer) software'''
* suitable for new PC with latest (almost) version of windows, and for people to plan to install new software onto it afterwards  -- dl
* eDonkey P2P file sharing mechanism is advocated to be used by above article to complete download of SP2 even if MS decides to unplug the SP2 offering (''watch out for security exposure introduced thru use of a P2P mechanism first''.)
* Best alternative for most users of WindowsXp is to wait out until SP2 behaviour is fully known. MS has posted a blocking tool that would stop SP2 downloads while still getting critical XP fixes.
** http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/winxppro/maintain/sp2aumng.mspx
* I am personally treating SP2 as a very important OS upgrade (not update) but treat the SP2 release as a large public beta -- dl
