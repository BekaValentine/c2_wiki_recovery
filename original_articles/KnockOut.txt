This is an optimized version of KVM (the K virtual machine), Sun's Java virtual machine offering for handhelds and other small devices with limited memory of about 128KB, but more power than smartcards. The idea behind it is to use gotos to replace switch-case-statements, goto being more efficient in this context. The project is now promoted by ideas from Rick's paper (Rick is a student from uestc[http://www.uestc.edu.cn for english: http://202.112.14.184/uestc/english/index_e.aspx ], see http://www.jetech.org), and is carried on by Vickie and Jarod for Epson's hand-helds.

In fact, we use AtisWiki in our project development. It's a nice experience.  -- Jarod (TianChengTang)

Later we moved to OddMuseWiki. This is a better one for KnockOut. -- Vickie & Jarod
