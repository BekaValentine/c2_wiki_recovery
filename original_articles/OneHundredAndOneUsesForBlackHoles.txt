In honor of Simon Bond's classic book ''One Hundred and One Uses for a Dead Cat'' (ISBN 0517545160 ), WardsWiki brings you:

'''101 uses for black holes'''  Only 14 uses have been suggested so far; which means there are 87 more to go.

* Perfect Toilet.
** But what if Hawking Radiation happens in chunks instead of gradual? Random [Bleep] balls appear.
*** Then you call the roto-rooter guy, he comes and pumps out your black hole, and trucks it to who-knows-where.  (Though one wonders how well that giant hose would work in the vacuum of space...)
* Perfect DisposalOfRadioactiveMaterial.
* MassDestructionWeapon. - ''indeed, a perfect WMD - it would destroy anyone who tried to use it.''
* A real DevNull
* A very large lens
* As a DarkEmitter (see DarkSuckers) (''DoctorSeuss, in one of his children's books, features a device called a "flashdark"--which, as you can imagine, performs the opposite function of a flashlight'')
* You can trap one in a wicker net with a candle: http://flea.sourceforge.net/singularitySnare.png
** ''But that's not a '''use''' for a BlackHole' that's how you catch one...''
** And, since when are BH's shiney?
* Put a door just outside the EventHorizon saying "executive washroom".  Tell the PointyHairedBoss that he's just been granted a new perk...
* Convenient place to find all your missing socks in one spot
* Repository for [undesirable] source code
* The ideal Suburban Extension to certain large cities.
** It would also be a good replacement for the proposed I-338 freeway in the Bay Area (http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/ix38.html#338ca)
* Ultimate status-symbol click-clack-ball desk toy
* Great golf-course hazard.  "And here's Tiger's approach shot...  he's got to be careful here; this shot will take him awfully close to the EventHorizon of the BlackHole here at Pebble Beach--I'd suggest that he try and hit it to the edge of the green.  He lines it up... looks good..." <ball disappears mid-flight>  "Oh!  It went straight into another universe, Bob!  That's a one-stroke penalty; he'll have to hit a perfect approach on the next shot just to have a chance at making ''bogey''!" <crowd groans; Woods curses under his breath>
* Hollywood movie plot device.  Don't worry about getting the details right.
* Destination for unwanted chunks of refactored WikiWikiWeb pages (if you fear being labelled DeleteMad).
* Make a very, very long rope.  Wind it around a spool connected to a generator.  Throw one end into a black hole.  Voila!  Electricity!
* Shouting match victory device. When somebody shouts "you suck!", pull out the black-hole, say "I sure do", and suck them in.
