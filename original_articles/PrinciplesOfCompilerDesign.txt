See also: 'Compilers - Principles, Techniques and Tools', by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman. ISBN 0201100886, published 1985 (the RedDragonBook). From the back of it:

''Anyone interested in compiler design is familiar with "The Dragon Book"... Since it was first published, the state of compiler design has advanced. As a result, Addison-Wesley announces the birth of a new dragon.''  (The Dragon Book they refer to is the GreenDragon, obviously...however the term TheDragonBook without a color nowadays usually referes to the RedDragonBook)

I guess the world has moved on a lot since ''that'' book too. Any advance?
