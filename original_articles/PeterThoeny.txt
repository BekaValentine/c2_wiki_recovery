'''Description''' : I started to work for TakeFive in May, 1998. I am doing a little bit of everything for the company, that is the nice thing working for a small company. We make and sell a source code engineeering tool called SNiFF+ ( http://www.takefive.com/products/ ).

Before TakeFive I have been working for a software company in Japan for many years, developing CASE tools. ( Denso Create Inc., http://www.dcinc.co.jp/ )

'''07/21/98''' : I think WardCunningham 's WikiWikiWeb idea is fantastic. I would like to deploy it on our Intranet as a Knowledge Base for finding answers to problems customers frequently ask. Where can I get the source of WikiWiki? The link in WikiWikiGoesPublic doesn't work, I just get a "unavailable during a temporary period of system upgrade" for over a month now.
