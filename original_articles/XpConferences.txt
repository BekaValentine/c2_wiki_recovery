XP2002

Building on the success of XP2000 and XP2001, the Third International Conference on ExtremeProgramming and AgileProcesses in SoftwareEngineering was a forum to discuss theories, practices, experiences, and tools on XP and other AgileSoftwareProcesses, like SCRUM, the AdaptiveSoftwareProcess, FeatureDrivenDevelopment and the CrystalSeries.

XP2002 brought together people from industry and academia to share experiences and ideas and to provide an archival source for important papers on agile process-related topics.

The conference was meant to provide information and education to practitioners, identify directions for further research, and to be an ongoing platform for TechnologyTransfer.

The conference consisted of technical presentations, panels, poster sessions, activity sessions, workshops, tutorials.
