I want to start a discusion here about the principles a web framework should follow. 

In spite of i want to focus on the Python programming language, this discussion is open to the general idea of a rest framework.

This is my first entry here so i know i have lot  of rules to read, i will be reading that at the same time i start typing here so i can go to somewhere and not lost my time reading stuff without getting the hit done ;) I just hope not being breaking important rules here, if I am and you notice that pleas let me know and i will correct and learn your way as soon as posible.

I know the warning on top, but this is actually a production entry not a test for sandbox, I will be testing stuff in sandbox too.
