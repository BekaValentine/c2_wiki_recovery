As TheAdjunct Wiki has gone to "read only" without warning and without explanation from the owner, it may be a good time to take measures for salvaging any pages that are important to you.  It all goes back to the beginnings of TheAdjunct, when many of us felt that it was just a ruse to rid Wiki of certain pages, and that TheAdjunct was always slated for a short life.

Now, and in the future, do not be too hasty in moving pages to TheAdjunct (if it ever comes to life again).  The loss of certain so called "controversial" pages is one of the things that has turned Wiki in to a more boring and uninspiring ghost-town environment anyway.

A healthy community is a good mix of work, innovation, inspiration, chatter, humor and play.

''Maybe such pages ought be clearly marked, so that WikiGnome''''''s do not accidentally delete them.  On the other hand, I prefer that this wiki remain topical.  Perhaps using a free wiki hosting service would be preferable?''
