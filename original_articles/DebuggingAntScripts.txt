Single-step debugging of ApacheAnt scripts is supported in EclipseIde and NetBeans IDE.
(But not IntellijIdea.)

'''EclipseIde:'''

How To:
* Set breakpoints by double-clicking on the left margin or '<right-click> + "Toggle Breakpoint"' in your ant build.xml file -- just like you would with Java code.
* In 'Outline' or 'Ant' views, right-click on a target and select 'Run As -> Ant Build' (Alt+Shift+X, Q).
* ''It's that easy!''

See "External Tools Configurations" dialog to edit ant runs you've done.
* 'Run -> External Tools -> External Tools Configurations...'
* ''(or)'' Right-click on an ant build file, and select 'Run As -> External Tools Configurations...'
