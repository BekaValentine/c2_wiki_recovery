Last GeekNight was poorly attended due to inclement weather.
However, this time we're coming back strong.

We're going to actually try and have the pizza there at 7pm on the dot, 
which means that to accurately gauge how much we need to purchase, we'll need a 
head count of who's going to be there, so please sign up below indicating whether or not you'll
be wanting pizza.

What's cooking: (post your topics here... don't be bashful!!)

	*MarathonMan II the wrath of DistributedCallbacks.
		*Will it finally all come together?

	*As-yet-untitled-but-basically-working-ASP.Net-code-behind-NUnit-extension

	*AltRMI - some help with unit tests please. It is 60% covered, but needs to be higher.

	*EnterpriseObjectBroker - We need to relase this soon. We also need a JBoss plugin - some spiking and hopefully real TDD is needed.

Attendees:

CharlesLowell.pizza = true

JimArnold - yes please.

new PaulHammant().setPizza(false);
