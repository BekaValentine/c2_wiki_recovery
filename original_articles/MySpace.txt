MySpace (http://www.myspace.com) is arguably the second largest and most popular SocialNetworking site in the world as of mid-2006, after Friendster (and much less focused on dating).  MySpace is very similar to Tribe (http://www.tribe.net), but with a more customizable profile, and additional features for bands and other "special" users.

MySpace is really an ugly animal which seems to be full of spam and ads. -- Vinci

I disagree. Myspace is a good way to keep in touch with friends. I enjoy using it as a way to communicate freely and it is much faster than using E-mail. --Rebeca

Myspace 'updated' in 2010 to add more facebook type feature.  However, it changed peoples profile style and runs slowly -- Jon 

MySpace is pretty much irrelevant now in today's world that revolves around Facebook. -- Nick
