Wiki, to me, is a place of organized information, ideas, and conversation. The thoughts are intertwingled and evolutionary in nature. Things grow in odd directions, cultivated by many, then are trimmed back and brought into more of an organized form when ideas have gelled.

There are many profilic contributors who come and go. I've been one of them, perhaps will be again. I've tried to add content and structure.

Structuring wiki is generally done in two ways: 

	* adding roadmaps such as ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap, that link together related topics with a little overview, and
	* creating and linking in new summary pages that bring together the ideas that have begun to gel.

People know the wiki, its places, its pathways. Building new places and new pathways is a good thing. 

The wiki concept is amenable to all kinds of things. On MetaBaby, there was a really cool thing on nowplaying. It's totally gone now. Maybe that's ok for MetaBaby. 

{RestructureAndConserveWiki:

In my opinion, this wiki is about continuity more than it is about abrupt change. Adding new structure and content is cool. Going through and ripping out everything one has contributed would be (was) not in accord with the WikiNature. Going through and restructuring it to one's own individual liking, in my opinion, isn't either. I could be wrong. If you think I am, say so.
}

Wiki isn't a planned community, but it is a community. In this community we do redecorate our neighbors' houses, but we always try to do it in accord with their style and custom. That, in my opinion, is how it should be.  Others may disagree. If they do, I hope they'll contribute here and, of course, everywhere. --RonJeffries

Maybe the wiki really is a place where you can go in and rename everything, remove anything, destroy its continuity. Maybe I'm just too last century. It could happen. --R

Maybe that's not a bad thing.  It's certainly an interesting thing.

Perhaps instead of renaming, removing and destroying what is, perhaps you can simply create new edges and include within them only what you are interested in, free from interference, but open to exchange and collaboration. One way this may be accomplished is to try:  SmallestFederatedWiki.  -- DonaldNoyes.20130105
