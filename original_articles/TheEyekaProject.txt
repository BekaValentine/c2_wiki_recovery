Eyeka (http://www.eyeka.com) is a french photo and video sharing platform. Trademarks come to the site to sponsor calls for submissions, meant to draw User Generated Content for their marketing purpose. The creative community is then sollicitated to compete on the projects. Winners are rewarded and featured. Eyeka takes a share of the trade and provides extra services such as co-branding and white labeling of their whole platform.

Eyeka is developped with the Ruby on Rails framework. It's an agile team of 5/7 persons using XP mixed with Scrum. I could not install all the XP practices but most of them were proven useful and successful, allowing a fluid adaptation to the 4 changes of business models during the 1st year (yes, it's a startup).
