From the XpMailingList, KentBeck describes using OneDayIterations as a way to do a lot of practicing:

We start with 1-day timeboxes for the first 2-3 weeks, so people get a lot of practice estimating, writing stories, integrating, planning, etc. After 10-15 cycles, we're ready to move to 1-week iterations. --KentBeck
