And proclaim that any food which has a taste and/or an appearance which can be improved by parsley is ipso-facto a dish unfit for human consumption.

	''Parsely.''
	''Is gharsley.''

THE DUCK

 Behold the duck.
 It does not cluck.
 A cluck it lacks.
 It quacks.
 It is 'specially fond
 of a puddle or pond.
 When it dines or sups
 it bottoms ups.
