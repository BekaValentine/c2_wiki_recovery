In ''Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML,''
DougRosenberg writes, "Whenever I spot a case of [AnalysisParalysis] coming on, I usually think about Shakespeare's ''Much Ado About Nothing'', because the nature of modeling (and of 'kitchen sink' notations such as the UML) makes it easy to generate lots of 'sound and fury, signifying nothing.'"

ShakespeareanAnalysis, then, is what happens when the analysis process focuses on issues that are not important or appropriate at the time.

It can be avoided by being aware of what '''is''' important and appropriate at the time, which implies a thorough understanding of the development process.

(Doug's quotation above is more than kind to Shakespearean analysts: a slightly extended excerpt (from ''Macbeth'', the "unlucky play") is, "it is a tale/Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/Signifying nothing." Try that one on your junior architect the next time he puts navigability arrows on domain model associations.)
