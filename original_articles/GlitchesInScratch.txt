There are many glitches in Scratch, and this page exists because there was one too many of them.

Scratch 1

* When you type a number small enough, (0.00000... ...00000000001) it displays NaN. It then does calculations like the number is irrelevant, even when it is not. This may be because Squeak cannot hold a large enough number in the memory. Seen in .4 --SimonMould

Scratch 2

* Calculation Errors

* When updating to .0v404 (from version unknown, possibly .0v403), the update bar goes further than the grey loading area. --SimonMould
