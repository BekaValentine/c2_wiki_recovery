* Number one on this list has to be the works of ChristopherAlexander such as TheTimelessWayOfBuilding and A PatternLanguage.

* Then comes DesignPatterns a.k.a. GOF (GangOfFour) which also has a DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion

* The PLoP series the conference series of the same name, PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign, especially PLoPD 3.

* KentBeck's SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns is a favorite, as much for the style as the content. Non-Smalltalkers can get a lot out of it too.

...and after those, consider the other books in the PatternRelatedBookList.
