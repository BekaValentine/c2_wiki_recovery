The standard ruby distribution comes with remote object handling stuff, DistributedRuby.
On top of that, there is a TupleSpace system named Rinda.

Then there is this final layer named Ring, which is very similar to JiniTechnology, in that it allows automagic service creation/discovery/registration.

Such a technology is useful whenever 

* the URI of a service is not known beforehand
* the URI of a name server is not known in advance
* services are periodically deleted or added from a name server
* services should be notified when contacted from new clients

A basic tutorial about it is available at: http://segment7.net/projects/ruby/drb/rinda/ringserver.html.
