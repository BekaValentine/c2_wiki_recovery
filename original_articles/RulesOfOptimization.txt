The "rules" of optimising are a rhetorical device intended to dissuade novice programmers from cluttering up their programs with vain attempts at writing optimal code. They are:

	1 '''FirstRuleOfOptimization - Don't.'''
	2 '''SecondRuleOfOptimization - Don't... ''yet''.'''
	3 '''ProfileBeforeOptimizing'''

It is uncertain at present, whether cute devices such as this have, or ever will, change any attitudes.

''It changed mine.''

''Mine, too.''

MichaelJackson used to say (when asked about optimization):
	1 Don't.
	2 Don't Yet (for experts only).

And lets not forget these famous quotes:

	 :	"The best is the enemy of the good."    
		 :	-- MrVoltaire

	 :	"More computing sins are committed in the name of efficiency (without necessarily achieving it) than for any other single reason - including blind stupidity."   
		 :	-- W.A. Wulf

	 :	"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: PrematureOptimization is the root of all evil." 
		 :	-- DonKnuth (who attributed the observation to CarHoare)
