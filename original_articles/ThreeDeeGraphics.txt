3D Graphics - Tips and Tricks

Check out OpenGl for the basics, it is the most industry-standard ApplicationProgrammingInterface for ThreeDeeGraphics, and works well, fast, and is used all over the place.

Some Concepts/Problems you'll run into:

ModelLoading (And TextureLoading)

HitTesting (AKA CollisionTesting or IntersectionTesting)

MotionControl

If you have these three things down, down cold, you've got a very fast, good engine.  These three sections are THE basis of all modern engines (Flight sim, FPS, etc.)

Some other Cool concepts:

SkeletonDeforming

ModelInterpolation

GeoMod

''Could anyone recommend any good books for learning about ThreeDeeGraphics and/or the other concepts listed above?''

For the basics of computer graphics I've found ''Computer graphics: principles and practice'' by James D. Foley to be extremely useful.
