I am currently the Chief Information Officer at Inland Truck Parts Company. I worked as a coder from 1980 - 1994 myself and have always been interested in the development process. Specifically I am searching for better ways to make the interaction between business people and developers more meaningful to each group and more productive overall. I have pointed my staff at these pages for education and inspiration. My favorite gleaning from WikiWikiWeb so far is KentBeck's "Requirements is a dialog, not a document." Now if I can just get all sides to understand this!

pickle and onion sandwiches for all!
