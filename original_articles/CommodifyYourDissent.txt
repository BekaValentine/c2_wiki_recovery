Commodify Your Dissent ''Frank, Weiland editors'' ISBN:0393316734

A collection of essays culled from ''The Baffler''. These are mostly vicious critiques of the intimate entanglement of capitalism and culture in America. 

Especial venom is reserved for companies marketing to the various synthetic youth sub-cultures the authors perceive.

The main targets are both the kind of people who thought they are making some kind of statement by going to a shop and buying a Rage Against The Machine t-shirt, and the people who sold it to them.
