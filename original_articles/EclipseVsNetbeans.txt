Eclipse is like Emacs, Netbeans is like Vi

''Care to elaborate?''

Ok,

Eclipse: big, tons of plugins/extensions, everyone uses it

Netbeans: smaller, faster, not as many plugins, not used as much. ''Not used as much is rather subjective as a comparison point to Vi, which has had a large fan base for years if not decades.'' So has Emacs
