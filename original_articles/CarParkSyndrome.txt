The CarParkSyndrome develops where one of the support branches of an organization has a manager who insists that the whole purpose of the organization is their part. One example is where the arrangements for carparking are for the convenience of the carpark organizers rather than visitors and other staff. My naming of this for the car park Is because I recall the problem from when I started working in 1972 where I still work now, and the same problem still applies. Only the managers have changed. -- JohnFletcher

This is pretty common when you consider that management as such is one of the internal functions of an organisation. You get it when managers start imposing onerous reporting requirements on processes simply so that they can do their "management" thing.
