Perhaps the German DseWiki, that I am just starting, might be of interest to you. It is a German Software Developers Wiki (Deutsches Software Entwickler Wiki) and it will try to create a similar universe to this wiki for German native speakers. DseWiki is open to all aspects of software development and all things that interest professional software developers. Look into the MeatballWiki (http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiTunneling) for additional information how this might relate to your XP/Java interests.
