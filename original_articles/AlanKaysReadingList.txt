I first met AlanKay in 1991 and then briefly but every 3 months for a 3-4 years thereafter at Vanguard conferences.  Alan is a true polymath and has a personal library of 5000 books.  Each time I met him I asked him for another book recommendation. Clearly others were doing the same.  Eventually he responded to the pressure and produced the following 'beginners reading list' which he sent to several of us.  I cherish the list.  There are some wonderfully funny comments in the list e.g. 'Plato (any etc.)'.  -- RichardPawson
