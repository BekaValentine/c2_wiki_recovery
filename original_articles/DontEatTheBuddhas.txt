''Saturday I walked to the travel bookstore downtown to purchase a map
of Australia.  I thought that it would be useful in combination with
other resources (guidebooks, the web, you :) to add to our list and
figure some things out -- I was having a hard time conceptualizing
where things were in relation to each other.  At the cash register,
they had these little red, yellow, and orange clear plastic buddhas.
There was a sign next to them reading "Please don't eat the buddhas --
they are not gummi, they are plastic!"  I laughed at the sign, and the
guy manning the register pointed at a buddha-shaped lollipop taped up
on the wall.''
