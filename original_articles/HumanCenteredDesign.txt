Technology is supposed to be invisible in this incarnation, like Granny's teapot I read about last week. It sends a record of when it is started up, refilled, poured from, and turned off to a web page so that her children and grandchildren can see that she is drinking her tea o.k. during the day.

In order to accomplish this, she never does anything but make tea with a new teapot.
