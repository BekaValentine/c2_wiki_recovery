Rough draft of a WikiWiki topic (page) encoding system for pondering that is LibraryOfCongressSystem- and DeweyDecimalSystem-influenced:

 GG-TT-DD-aaa.bbb.ccc...
* GG: General type - 
** TC = tool category or generalization (eg. database)
** TS = specific tool or project (eg. MySql) (Not "ST" because trying to keep T's together)
** TF = tool feature (eg. database indexes)
** DP = design philosophy, principle, or paradigm (eg. OOP, FP, Agile)
** OR = organization/location-related/industry/standards (eg. Microsoft, accounting, laws of a country)
** PI = personal info or bio
** HU = human-factors (WetWare/UI's/writing-styles/office-politics/society-vs-tech)
** OH = off-topic (non-IT), humor, or whimsical
** HE = help, getting started with this wiki, intro, etc.
** WI = Wiki-related - wiki maintenance, wiki engines
** ME = meta discussion, or discussion about wiki rules or style, or category codes
** OT = other or mixed

* TT: Tool or technology type
** LA = Computer Language and Syntax
** PR = Programming techniques and frameworks
** DA = Data systems or info transfer (eg. RDBMS, XML)
** AI = Artificial Intelligence, knowledge & search engines
** CW = Content manager/wiki/file-system/unstructured or semi-structured info
** CI = Coordination/Integration/Administration/OS
** UI = User interface, reports, or presentation systems
** PS = Protection/Security/Inspection
** DO = Documentation-related
** SI = Software products for IT (eg. IDE's, compilers)
** SE = Software products for end-users or general work (eg. word-processors)
** HE = End-user hardware (desktops, smart phones, etc.)
** HI = Infrastructure or general hardware - Servers, networks, back-end hardware, CPU instruction sets, etc.
** OT = Other or mixed
** NA = Not applicable 

* DD: Discussion type - 
** SU = summary/intro/menu
** DE = description or explanation
** SO = solutions/how-to
** VO = vocabulary-related or definition
** HI = history/stories/anecdotes
** PC = pro/con's or debate
** DS = discussion/Q&A/speculation/suggestions
** BK = description or discussion about a specific book or publication
** OT = other or mixed

* aaa.bbb.ccc... The rest is a numerical hierarchy. The initial goal is to try to stick to 3 digits per segment, but I'm not sure that's realistic over the long run. Perhaps the general divisions would follow the divisions set by GG, and TT secondarily, but only in a rough sense because GG may overlap and/or the segment categories may overlap with GG.

* Notes: 
** If topic is long and mixed, then generally the first few pages determine the classification such that "mixed" (OT) would not be used except in extreme cases.
** Some abbreviations are chosen because they stand out better, not necessarily because they best represent the category. For example, "AI" and "BK" are perhaps overly-specific, but are easily recognizable and/or memorable compared to known alternatives.
