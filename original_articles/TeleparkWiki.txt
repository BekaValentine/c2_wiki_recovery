telepark.wiki is a interactive Wiki with an AJAX-powered hierarchical navigation system 
and visual editor (WYSIWYG).

The authoring is done in the Web browser itself without the need for any additional software or 
download. telepark.wiki allows the visual formatting of each page with the convenience of an 
in-built editor similiar to Microsoft Word.

telepark.wiki offers a tree-type hierarchical navigation to keep one's wiki organized and easy to use.  
The number of levels in the navigation tree can be limited artificially (e.g. to 3 levels) 
by way of configuration or can be unlimited.

 A freeware version is available.
