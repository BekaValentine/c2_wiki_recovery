The Sun JavaDatabaseConnectivity driver that allows a Java programmer to connect to an OpenDatabaseConnectivity data source.

By the way, Sun does not support this driver and does not recommend that it be used for production applications. I can vouch personally that it has some serious, deal-breaker problems, such as not supporting auto-commits correctly when interfacing with Microsoft Access (don't ask).
