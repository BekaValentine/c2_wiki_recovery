I have this really cool belt pack that I keep my expensive Rotring pens and pencil in: Black fountain, Red fountain, 0.7mm pencil.

At a workshop at OOPSLA, BruceAnderson was standing behind me, staring at my hip. At first I ignored him, hoping he would lose interest and go away. Finally I looked at him quizzically. 

"Is that a NerdPack," asked Bruce.  "I don't know," I replied. "It's expensive, it's leather, it's not in my shirt pocket."

David Arnone was listening in. He asked, "Are the pens in any particular order?"

I answered, "yes".

"It's a NerdPack," he pronounced.

I don't suppose there's a link available to this particular item, is there?

I suffer from a disease that compels me to have things on my belt.
