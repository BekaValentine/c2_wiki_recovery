This could take many forms, and I've seen a couple. The most disturbing is to see those who follow the practices without understanding the mindset. Say, a draconian management team enforces TestDrivenDevelopment (an excellent practice) while forgetting IndividualsAndInteractionsOverProcessesAndTools. -- DonBranson

I'm not sure if this is the same as AgileInNameOnly, but that's what my firm practices.  TestDrivenDevelopment is pretty much our only agile practice.
