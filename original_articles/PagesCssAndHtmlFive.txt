''The following is a '''Project Developing into WhatItWantsToBe''' '' DonaldNoyes.DoingStuff.20140520
----
---stuff will be done about it here in incremental fashion, day by day, week by week
* project to last from 6 to 12 months
---approaches included in the project:
* sometimes we want more than one page of related textual information to appear on multiple monitors in flexible form
* we would like it to look good while preserving the ability to move it around, perhaps even resize it
* we want to try stuff that is new in an experimental framework, using new structures and techniques
* we want to experiment, innovate and extend the usefulness of textual information based on applying a limited markdown and a subsequent local interpretation and construction using the three listed and TheOtherThings. ( pages, css, html5 and .... )
---the techniques:
* where information is imported for use, import as text, limit the use of links to that existing locally, do not link to potentially dangerous external locales which might compromise the level of security you desire to employ
* links to sites on the internet where you control the stored information and processes allowed might be made safe and useful
* the information stored in this experiment will include text and images of text with an occasional use of TheOtherThings
* content will include indexes or listings which will allow selection of any textual material in your local experimental collection, either by name or number
