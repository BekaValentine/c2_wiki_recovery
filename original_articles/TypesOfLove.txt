What does Eros ''feel like'' from the inside? And while we're at it, what is its symptomology exactly?

My experience is of some vague sense of well-being and sensuality. Nothing remarkable until things turn bad. Separation from the other person leads to depression over a matter of days, whereas the real or imagined breakup of the relationship causes instant misery.

move here from DefinitionOfLove:

The GreekLanguage has four different words for love to cover different aspects, including (but obviously not limited to) love suited to physical attraction, and love suited to family ties. Hazy memory: eros is physical attraction; philia is friendship; storge is affection; agape is what St Paul was writing about in 1 Corinthians 13 (see above).
