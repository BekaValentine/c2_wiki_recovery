Software or hardware that compels the user to spend more time tweaking, configuring, adding-on, and generally serving the machine than they do actually using it.

This includes:

* a notorious proprietary operating system that requires regular yearly outlays of time and money. And the CPU manufacturer it rode in on.
* LinuxDistribution''''''s that never work when installed but entail nights and weekends of searching, downloading, combining and tweaking packages.
* hardware manufacturers that advertise "plug and play" but don't have the drivers ready for your OS revision.
* the many open source programmers that HelpSourceForgeSuck.
* just about any Unix WindowManager.
