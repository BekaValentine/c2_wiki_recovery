Some people here believe wiki is improved by CompellingIrritant''''''s. In 8 years of WikiZen''''''ship, I have never found that to be the case. Others are determined to be HarshEditor''''''s. I have never seen such editing improve wiki. And still others are determined to be TopicPolice. I have never found any need to have the topicality of this place protected by such a person. What I have seen is a lot of destructive edits justified by appeals to these shibboleths. And I'd sure like to see such people wise up and help make the place kinder, happier, and more interesting. --PeterMerel
