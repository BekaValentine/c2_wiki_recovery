Make does more work than I could ever wrap my head around,
it can understand prpblems much larger than any human can,
so I still write recipies for it.

StuFeldman invented its algorithm, and it is still a robust thing to do all the time.  Maybe your UnitTest''''''s rely on running '''make''' in a certain directory or against a certain target (''i.e. '''''make tests''')

The original MakeAlgorithm appears in a one page AwkScript in the AwkBook (Not at hand tonight, page numbers later ~~ 188 )
