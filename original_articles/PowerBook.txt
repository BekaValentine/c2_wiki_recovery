PowerBook is the best laptop computer ever :-)

Apple stuck an IntelDuo in it and changed the name to MacBook.

''The name is a conscious nod to the DynaBook.''

I would agree; at least the best that I have ever owned.  A true UnixBox in a laptop, due to the sheer joy that is MacOsx.  -- ChadThompson

I would also agree.  It's wide-screen resolution is incredible, but its speed and Unix roots are what make the difference for me.  I think I can safely say that I will be MicrosoftWindows-free for the rest of my days.  --DaveHoover
	 :	I find that is almost true. I have had to keep using MicrosoftWindows in a VirtualPC for a few applications I use on a day to day basis. MindManager and TheBrain are the main cuplrits; though I also need it for MicrosoftAccess and the designer client in LotusNotes. -- GarethHowell

MeToo.  Most of the AlphaGeeks around me have finally seen the light. -- HansGerwitz

Agree virtually. My experience with WinTel laptops has been pretty miserable. My little 700Mhz G3 iBook is a pleasure to use, if I could afford a PowerBook I would not hesitate to upgrade. --StevenNewton

17", 1Ghz, ... Where do you go when you have everything? Oh yeah, light up the keyboard! ;-)  -- DannyFrey

Also value in long life. Still using powerbook G3/300MHz after several years. Although only OS 10.2.x. --BifCondor

Amazing machine. I get compliments constantly about it -- Simba S

I love my 12" machine's size so much that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to upgrade to an Intel machine
