PieterJansegers is a teacher of French as a foreign language, a collector of dictionaries and an ICT enthusiast. Now also TwitterConsultant ...

His interest for French as a foreign language combined with his ICT skills is beginning to be known to the larger world community of teachers of French.

He is a Belgian. Look for other Belgian interactive teachers of French: http://teachers.freecities.com

At ten, his uncle EwaldArijs, taughtt him how to program in BasicLanguage, although his uncle preferred PascalLanguage himself, on an Apple. PieterJansegers did get a Commodore 64 [CommodoreSixtyFour] for his birthday that same year. (His birthyear being 1972, that was quite normal.)

Being able to program in TurboPascal and Logo, Logo was his favorite language, that's probably why he likes this environment: it reminds of the building structure of the LogoLanguage.

VisualBasic, HTML [HyperTextMarkupLanguage] and JavaScript are the three more recent covered areas. The combination of the last two gives a return to basics feeling.

Some knowledge of UnixOperatingSystems. But he never really programmed anything on it, apart from a website in the time of Gopher. (An automatically expending one, based on his recorded favorites on the university server.)

He would like to become a WikiMaster, but he has first to reduce his ego. Is there an oriental Buddhistic inspiracy behind Wiki?

It's fun to imitate the Caesar third person writing style!

Now experiencing the http://www.smartschool.be digital schoolplatform. Quite nice...

----

BTW, Dutch is the canonical ForeignLanguage, as instanced by "it's all Dutch to me".

''Uh, you mean '''Greek'''?''

Sorry, it was a comment by a visitor and I don't know why he/she considers Dutch as we Belgian consider Chinese to be completely understandable. -- pj

''I've always assumed "Greek" was used merely out of political correctness - after all, the totally incomprehensible is referred to as Double Dutch, not Gobbledegook Greek.''

About the flag indication on sites: 
How about Swahili? Any flag in particular? :-) -- ra

''''quick info transfer area''''

The inverse world compared to the openness of wiki...
Currently getting 'orkut' (read: bored) of it... not really as fun as would be possible -- pj

But http://www.cafewiki.org is quite interesting. A sort of expanded wiki system. Not all extensions are that nice. Especially the syntax is getting out of control, but that's the price to pay for altering Wiki.

I found the site http://www.gmane.org/ and I'm exploring that one at the moment.

On the MicrosoftCorporation : remember the classic "Is Windows a Virus?" [http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/article09-115]

and the other one "Win95 vs Jesus Christ"
[http://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~omri/Humor/JesusVsWin95.html]

Also reading about wiki and technology; and experiencing WabiSabi

Let's add the WikiSocialNorms page...

I've adopted the Chinese name for registrations on some Chinese sites. Apparently, the character for my surname can't be used on this wiki. http://alpha.app.net/jansegers/post/8092833

Use also the MetaWikiSearchEngine at http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl

and look at the the canonical list of WikiEngines

and the World Wide Wiki at SwitchWiki http://www.worldwidewiki.net/wiki/SwitchWiki

If you don't like reading stuff you're not certain of that it will interest you, reduce the volume of it by using synope demo at http://www.carp-technologies.nl/en/index.php3?page=/en/home.html (works for English and Dutch, quite nice results, I tried it out on some Wiki Pages and Tech articles)


''Try http://www.rocketdownload.com/details/inte/6905.htm instead.''

I will look at it...
Attention it is redirected now to http://www.rocketdownload.com/index.php !

How about the web-based AOL Quick Buddy or ICQ''2GO!'' then? No installation required. -ra

Thanks RA !

http://www.illumirate.com might be interesting. 

It proves to be this way, yet Dmoz seems more powerful, but like illumirate is language non-specific, it could gain more interest over the long run. Language specificity is being the weak part of Dmoz, categorization of multilanguage sites is the big problem and also that of language teaching sites that are mainly in the target language. Illumirate has no problem with such a site.

Now checking out the Claroline platform by introducing French course material on the Eniversity site:

At this moment my contribution on my family name cognates is busy on wikipedia, maybe my page will be deleted. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Log/2005_January_31

My defense and acceptance of the decision that will be taken, whatever it will be can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jansegers

I'm writing cyberhistory here, but that wasn't the aim.

Finding out about http://www.conversate.org
Could be quite interesting. Not a wiki, not a blog, not a forum, not a guestbook, but a cooperative writing experiences limited or not to friends and colleagues...

Also testing the http://del.icio.us/ services and adding to the tag-world my own bit of info.

Interesting blogs:

http://www.socialpublishing.blogspot.com/


Interesting for finding people:

http://www.masterliness.com/

Social network creation site

http://ning.com

This site could become the new leader in the social sites field. Even facebook.com or myspace.com aren't this powerfull. It's an Orkut/Friendster like site, but on the next level.

Three main English language nings of mine were :

webosophy.ning.com , credentials.ning.com and searchengines.ning.com

BTW I've killed off all of my 20 nings like it become a pay service...

Learning PHP and testing it in the online IDE at http://coderun.com

Now creating a microblog media empire...

I believe microblogs are changing society profoundly, because information can easily be past through on a world wide scale at a pace never seen before.

-- REQUEST about PersonalSystemTwo --

Any chance to get a PS/2 system disk? My semi-portable IBM computer failed me at the end of 2005 (an INTEL-based model) and I can't get it started any more...

I'm looking to recover the data on it.

Thanks a lot.
