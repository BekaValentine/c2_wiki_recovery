Is this about languages that represent patterns or how to describe patterns in "human" languages? You see, some of us RelationalWeenie''''''s think that relational notation can compactly represent many parts of GOF-like patterns. A RelationalWeenie may belong to the camp of people trying to describe "patterns" with formal math-like formulas. IOW, couldn't math be thought of as a "pattern language"? I don't want to start a HolyWar here, but just am seeking clarification of what is meant by "pattern language".
