John currently works for Tellabs doing Advanced Technology in voice and data networking.  Prior to that he worked for Motorola on mobile systems and in voice recognition.  He knew JimCoplien at Bell Labs.  His first memory of patterns was talking to Cope for a few minutes about attaching a radioactive source to a software change request and recording the pattern as it moved through the people doing the work.
