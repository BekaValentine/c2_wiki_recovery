Everyone is a WikiMember. NuffSaid.


What kind of member do people turn out to be sometimes?  Here's a collected list of known stereotypes, roughly ranked from better to worse, along with one new suggestion (WikiBoar).  I am probably missing some, but I tried to minimize duplicates.

* WikiMaster (can be good or bad)
* WikiGnome, VolunteerHousekeeper
* WikiCitizen (any WikiMember, but expected to be a GoodWikiCitizen)
* AnonymousOnPurpose
* WikiMember (neutral), WikiParticipant (doesn't sound like a body part)
* WikiLurker (harmless, read-only)
* WikiPolice (can be good or bad, sometimes ''too'' good, see WikiBoar)
* WikiPuppy
* WikiGremlin
* TrollDefinition
* WikiBoar (new, not as bad as a WikiVandal but even more annoying and pig-headed.  Like a WikiPolice guy gone horribly bad, or a WikiMaster-wannabe.  Writes in first-person ''plural''.)
* WikiVandal
* WikiSpam''''''mer
* WikiButcher
