So, what sort of workshops are people thinking about for the WikiSym
conference? This friday is the due date for submitting workshop
proposals.

Here are three of my ideas. If you would be
interested in hosting or attending any of these, please let me know at my page at http://communitywiki.org/BayleShanks

* InterWiki workshop: discuss how to make wikis interoperate with each other and with other software; also topics like WikiMarkupStandard (although if there is a lot of interest in WikiMarkupStandard, that could be its own workshop)

* PICA workshop: PICA is an idea for an organization like IETF but for rapid, non-intimidating, semiformal proto-standards development (that is, probably like what IETF used to be). See http://communitywiki.org/PICA

* Wiki moderation/filtering workshop: to discuss potential technologies for conserving the attention/time of wiki users in a busy world. Examples: SubscribedChanges, PageCluster, RecentChanges digests in various forms, WebOfTrustModeration, ViewPoint, RatingGroups.


thanks,
