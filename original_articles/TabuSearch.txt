Tabu (or taboo) search is a MetaHeuristic along with GeneticAlgorithm''''''s and SimulatedAnnealing. The basic gist of tabu search is to iteratively try to find solutions to the problem, but to keep a short list of previously found solutions and to avoid 're-finding' those solutions in subsequent iterations. Basically, if you try a solution, it becomes tabu in future tries. It is surprisingly robust, but of course, there's NoFreeLunch.
