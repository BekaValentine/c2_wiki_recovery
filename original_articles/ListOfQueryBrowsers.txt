This is a list of tools that can browse the results of queries. There is a specific product called "Query Browser", but in this context it's a generic term, unless specified otherwise. A query browser will generally allow issuing and saving SQL (or other query languages), and allows the browsing of results via a TableBrowser and exporting such as CSV. They often connect via ODBC or JDBC. Fancier versions have parameter insertion, schema browsers, QueryByExample, data entry, local post-processing (such as local aggregation), and vendor-specific enhancements.

'''RDBMS-Specific Browsers'''

* ToadTool - Primarily for Oracle, but they are expending into other RDBMS vendors.
** ''"'''Expending''' into other RDBMS vendors...?"  Is that a Freudian slap?''
** Knowing Oracle's MO, it may become a prophecy.

* Many RDBMS vendors supply such a tool specific to their product. These include:
** DBrowser - for ''Rel''. See the RelProject.

'''Multi-RDBMS Browsers'''

* Forest & Trees - A rather old tool that has a kind of cult following because of the way one can make "work spaces" and forms.

* MicrosoftAccess - It has limited ability to connect to other RDBMS. Not always friendly when used with non-MS RDBMS.

* OpenOfficeBase

* More to come...

'''Non-RDBMS Browsers'''

* SqLiteManager - A MozillaFirefox addon that exposes FF's internal SqLite functionality to query/browse/edit/export any SQLite db file
