PerfAnal is a GUI-based tool for analyzing the performance of applications on the Java 2 Platform. You can use PerfAnal to identify performance problems in your code and locate code that needs tuning. The PerfAnal tool simplifies this analysis in two ways: 

	* It interprets the profile data to report the total cost of methods. 
	* It presents its results in a graphical format to assist in your analysis.
