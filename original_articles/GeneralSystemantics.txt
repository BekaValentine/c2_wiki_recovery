''Systemantics: The Underground Text of Systems Lore'' by John Gall, D.H. Gall (Illustrator) [[ISBN:0961825103]]

Also ''Systemantics: How Systems Work & Especially How They Fail'' by John Gall [[ISBN 0812906748]]

Systemantics is what I thought was a funny book written by a medical doctor in New England called Gall. I was in Britain at the time. Since I moved to the states, I've realized that he was not exaggerating. It is all about how systems fail to work. Here are some of the ideas - from memory.

* A complex working system will be found to have evolved from a small working system.
* To make a complex system, start with a small one and grow it. (kinda familiar?)
* If you want to get something done - do not create a system.
* No system ever does what its name says it does. (this comes from GeneralSemantics).
* Any sufficiently complex system exhibits antics. (Hence the name: system-antics),
* When a large system goes wrong, its makers usually try to do the same thing only bigger next time. (The titanic effect)
* All systems encroach.
* The file is the reality.

there are a couple dozen more.... rules to live by... IMHO
