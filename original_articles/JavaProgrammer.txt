A person dedicated to implementing the perfect automatic coffee bean machine (Like TuringMachine but different).

Note that the perfect automatic coffee bean machine must start with growing the beans themselves, as the quality of the beans is a crucial aspect of the quality of the resulting coffee. Sweeteners such as sugar can typically be supplied in a processed form, but other products used in the manufacture of coffee (such as milk) may need to be produced by the machine itself.
