A mode of WikiTraversal preferably implemented using a browser with tabs. Basically works like so:

* Go to RecentChanges
* For all open tabs, do:
** Open all links in a new tab while reading the page
** Close tab when you've read to the end

(If your browser does not have tabs, you can open links in new windows, but that would probably be a whole lot less convenient)

To make it a little more interesting, don't open all links - only the ones interesting to you.

I find this BreadthFirst traversal mode best for the times when I have time to kill but nothing specific to kill it with.

'''What's your traversal mode?'''

DepthFirst: start at FrontPage, follow the first blue (unvisited) link, repeat.  Only backtrack if there are no blue links on the page.
