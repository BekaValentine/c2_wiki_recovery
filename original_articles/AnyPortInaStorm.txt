''This is not the whole story. '''Any Port in a Storm''' has the clear implication that you are currently in deep trouble and any way of getting you out of that trouble will suffice until the storm blows over. This is not at all the same as MarryTheFirstSolution.''

[And by the way, this does '''not''' refer to USB ports, oh you snarky Wikizens. I know what you're thinking, you scamps.]
