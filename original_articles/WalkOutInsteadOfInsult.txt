Rather than insult somebody who frustrates you, consider just "walking about": abandoning the discussion. Insults rarely have their intended affect and usually just result in counter-insults and FlameWar escalations.

Perhaps walking out also allows one to calm down and gather their thoughts so that they can try a different angle to the dispute.

''Topic happy, are we? IveLeftToCode already explains this quite well.''

I don't feel they are similar enough. IveLeftToCode is not self-describing enough. But let's entertain other opinions on this and see if we can reach a consensus.

''Start yet another page... WalkOutSlowlyInsteadOfNameCalling since the word insult is too insulting. Name calling is much nicer. And the word slowly lengthens the page title more, which is good - and it emphasizes how nice we are. The word insult, is just too damaging to all of us. It is just like BrainDamage - just saying that out loud hurts my feelings.. and so does the word '''insult''' since it is so powerful and cutting. And it was obviously directed right at me - not just a pattern - it was definitely direct at me, directly. Directly.''

I have no problem with the "name calling" suggestion, but don't see the necessity of "slowly".

''Could start an IveLeft page, with page anchors too. Different reasons for temporary leaving.. etc.''
