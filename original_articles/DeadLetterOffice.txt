The post office here in Oz has a dead letter office, where misdirected letters which do not accidentally hit a realistic address end up. Where is the dead letter office on the internets. Today I posted a reply to a salesman which necessarily required a misleading return email address. While I do not wish to continue the dialogue, I would love to hear his reply. Can I find it in the dead letter office?
