We've recently been looking for new display technologies, and have run across this device:

	 :	High-density, lap-top information display device. Nonvolatile memory with zero power consumption.  Able to display text and graphics at 1250 dots per inch resolution in monochrome or up to 32,000 colours on a 100 mega-pixel display.  Features simple, intuitive, direct-manipulation user-interface with both sequential and random-access mechanisms.  Functional at temperatures from -120 to +451 degrees F.

Turns out we've already got quite a few of these ...

''That's cool.  So, um, how does Firefox, or an OpenOffice document, look on this wizzy new display?''
