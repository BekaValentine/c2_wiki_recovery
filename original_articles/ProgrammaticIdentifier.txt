In the MicrosoftWindows world, a Prog''''''Id, or ProgrammaticIdentifier, is a registry entry that can be associated with a Cls''''''Id. The format of a Prog''''''Id is <Vendor>.<Component>.<Version>, separated by periods and with no spaces, as in Word.Document.6. Like the Cls''''''Id, the Prog''''''Id identifies a class, but with less precision.

ProgrammaticIdentifier''''''s are mainly used by AutomationLanguage''''''s which cannot deal with the GUID (GloballyUniqueIdentifier) structure. For example, the ScriptingEngine environment usually exposes some form of a Create''''''Object method which takes a Prog''''''Id.
