Hello, welcome to my own page on the WikiWikiWeb.

At the moment, I don't have a whole lot to say. I suspect that that will change.

One thing I can say is that I am not the character from Roman Holiday, although my daughter is amused by the idea, as well as pretending that she is Audrey Hepburn...

Since last editing this page, I have moved to the Greater Omaha area, which is actually a fairly nice place. I do miss the mountains, though, and hope to return there (but in the Java world, though!) before too much water flows down the South Platte...
