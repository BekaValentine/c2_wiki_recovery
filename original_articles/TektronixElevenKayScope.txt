
The TektronixInc 11xxx series of sampling oscilloscopes is well known among many members of this Wiki, for being an example of a successful embedded deployment of SmalltalkLanguage.  The 11k, as it is commonly known, was a staple of the Tek product line for quite a few years.

The 11k featured a MotorolaSixtyEightKay processor, ample memory, and a little light on the main circuit board that turned on whenever the GarbageCollector ran.  It used an embedded Smalltalk environment from OTI, and contrary to many doubters, performance was not an issue.  (Unfortunately, the product abandoned the traditional UI model that oscilloscopes have, and got a reputation for being difficult to use.)

The Smalltalk enviroment was used in several other Tek scopes as well, the 11k was the one which survived the longest.

The 11k series now has been discontinued (Tek stopped manfuacturing them a few years ago).  You can still find them used (early models can be got for pretty cheap, too).  Tek's high-end scopes are now mostly PCs with special purpose acquisition and signal-processing hardware (and a customized, scope-like case).
