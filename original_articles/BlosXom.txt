Blosxom is a lightweight yet robust and featureful WebLog application written in PerlLanguage with a LessIsMore approach to its own code and an architecture that allows for easy development of PlugIn''''''s to extend its functionality.

It's much more WabiSabi than something large like MovableType.

''BlosXom is UgLy.  May I suggest BlosxomBlogger?''

The name was picked deliberately - the "x" in "Blosxom" refers to MacOsx (properly spelt Mac OS X), for which it was originally developed. Also, BlosxomBlogger is redolent of blogger.com, which it is most definitely not.
