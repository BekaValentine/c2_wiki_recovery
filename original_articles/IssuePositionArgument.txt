The Issue Position Argument pattern divides a position (what "should" be) from the debate or IssueStatement, and from the underlying arguments that advance this particular position as the optimal way to resolve the main issue.  A position is usually FactionallyDefined, that is, factions tend to form based on positions they hold in common.

Both concepts are central to OpenPolitics and an OpenParty.
