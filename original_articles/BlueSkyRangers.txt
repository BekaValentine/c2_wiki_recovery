	 :	Once upon a time, as the 1980s were dawning, Atari more or less had the video game market to itself. Then Mattel Toys introduced Intellivision -- Intelligent Television! The first Intellivision games, produced by an outside software firm, were so successful that Mattel started a new company -- Mattel Electronics -- to develop games in-house. A staff of young, creative, and pretty damn good-looking programmers was hired. For fear that Atari would try to lure them away, Mattel insisted that their identities be kept anonymous; they were referred to in publicity as The Blue Sky Rangers.

	 :	After Chris Markle, who was working on the official Winter Olympics cartridge, left Mattel Electronics, no one was assigned to continue it.

	 :	Astrosmash started out as a clone of the arcade game Asteroids, called Meteor!. The game wasn't very big, so John Sohl used the extra room in the cartridge to come up with a variation called Avalanche using the same graphics and sound effects. At the last minute, afraid of a lawsuit from Atari, the Mattel lawyers killed the Asteroids-like Meteor!. Rather than risk introducing bugs by deleting code, John simply put a branch around the opening-screen menu straight into the Avalanche! variation, which was released under the name Astrosmash [...]

	 :	John simply branched around the code for the Asteroids version of the game; the code is still in the cartridge. Verrrry rarely, when there's a glitch hitting RESET, the Asteroids version will show up on screen. (This would be a dandy Easter egg if it were intentional or reliably repeatable, but it's neither.)
