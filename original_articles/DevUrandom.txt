A file on Linux systems, /dev/urandom, that implements a cryptographically secure PseudoRandomNumberGenerator seeded by /dev/random (DevRandom).

Random bytes are generated in response to a read() request.

Unlike /dev/random, it won't stall waiting for more entropy from physical events before generating more output in response to a read request.
