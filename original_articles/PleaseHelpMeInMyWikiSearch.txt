'''Question'''

''While not strictly relevant, I offer this as a data point: Another lecturer and I have used a wiki in a final year class on Artificial Intelligence, with a cohort of approximately sixty students. The students were required to submit an essay assignment as a Wiki page or set of pages. This was quite successful, with no deliberate defacement. The students appeared to respond well to this, and the feedback was positive. The most significant problem, if any, was that although we encouraged the students to cross-reference (link to) each other's work, they tended not to -- with a few exceptions, each student's work tended to be a WalledGarden unto itself. Of course, this is true here as well. I frequently find myself scrambling to remember enough of a WikiPage I saw three weeks ago in order to search for it and create an appropriate link; often as not I can't find it and the concept or whatever remains unlinked. I'm sure there's a WikiWord that describes this effect in detail, but I ran across it three weeks ago and now I can't find it.'' -- DaveVoorhis

'''Answers'''

One way to tackle this starts when you are reading the page. I often ask myself, what links could this page use? Then I may well add some links myself, both to and from the page. I also do this with new pages I start, trying to make sure that they integrate well with other pages, even if I am not sure where it will all lead. Among other things, this leads to a trail in the recent changes, which I can follow up if I loose track of what I was thinking about. Also, it is possible to use the "what links to this page" and I can use that on my home page to find the pages which I have signed. When it comes to searches, I find it helpful that wiki remembers my past searches and suggests things. -- JohnFletcher
