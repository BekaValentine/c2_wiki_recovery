Proprietary LotusNotes (more of a collaboration/portal than a WikiClone)

Note that searching for current info using the term "QuickPlace" will be frustrating since it was apparently renamed in 2003 to "My Lotus Team Workplaces" then simply "IBM WorkPlace" as per these two articles: (sorry for the byzantinely long URL's--that's part of the charm of old-world IBM...)

"IBM Builds Powerful Collaboration Capabilities into WebSphere Portal" : http://www.ibm.com/press/PressServletForm.wss?MenuChoice=pressreleases&TemplateName=ShowPressReleaseTemplate&SelectString=t1.docunid=350

"IBM Launches New Workplace Offerings for Organizations of Any Size or Industry" : http://www.ibm.com/press/PressServletForm.wss?MenuChoice=pressreleases&TemplateName=ShowPressReleaseTemplate&SelectString=t1.docunid=7394

"Business Partners go public with praise, plans for IBM Workplace Services Express"
http://www.ibm.com/software/swnews/swnews.nsf/n/jmae66erkk?opendocument&site=lotus (mentions SharePoint as prime competition)

Note that in the above 3 articles, it seems that LotusNotes is downplayed.  Is IBM steering customers towards "standards-based" (code name for JavaBased) WebSphere instead?

Here's a funny article about an older version of QuickPlace (calls it "Qui''''ckSand"

From what I can tell, it seems less like a wiki and more like a portal/CMS, but with that characteristic flair that I've come to associate with large commercialware: sluggish, ugly, lame. But, as claimed at http://publib-b.boulder.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/9445fa5b416f6e32852569ae006bb65f/737ca2e8da14e0d285256ae70049af6d?OpenDocument

"Lotus QuickPlace is the leading self-service Web tool for team collaboration. With QuickPlace, teams can share a virtual workspace to communicate, collaborate, and coordinate. People can create and share documents and knowledge, discuss ideas, coordinate tasks, do project management, just to mention a few of the features that QuickPlace offers."
