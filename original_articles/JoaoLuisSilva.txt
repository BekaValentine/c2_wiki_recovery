I'm a wiki newbie that thought this would be a nice place to put a text I wrote sometime ago while writing a medium size (10-15k lines) Visual Basic application. I hope to save others some of the troubles I had. You can find it in VbClassicSurvivalGuide.

Hi Joao.  Thanks for the survival guide.  I wish I had read it before I started a recent project with MicrosoftAccess and VisualBasicForApplications, but better late than never.  I figured some things out about VisualBasic on my own (like integers vs. longs), but your guide was still very helpful to me.  -- DavidConrad
