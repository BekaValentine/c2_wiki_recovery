Of course, not every teen is going to spend time reading. But there are books that can take a kid a lot further than a boatload of sage advice. Kids need seeds for thoughts outside the stuff the media machine shovels in their eyes. The idea here is to list books that did something marvellous for you when you were younger - stuff that transported you to places you'd never have dreamed of on your own. Stuff that astounded you. Stuff they can't put down.

* StrangerInaStrangeLand - RobertHeinlein
** to tell the story of the widow's son while effectively insulating them from the rituals and cults surrounding it.
** to learn to be an awfully good kisser

* AlwaysComingHome - UrsulaLeGuin
** to teach the shedding of artifice and materialism, to show how to find/make a community, and to appreciate the lyricism of the wild.

* TheCircusOfDoctorLao - CharlesFinney
** to point out that marvels lurk around every corner, if you're brave enough to turn your self in their direction.

* SnowCrash - NealStephenson
** to show how to throw off HypnoCracy, subvert your own language, and program your own head.

* TheAncientEngineers - SpragueDeCamp
** to explain the true underpinnings of Western thought, how we got here, and how to see beyond surface understandings.

* MyIshmael - DanielQuinn
** Totally redefined how I looked at school, culture and the world around me. It's especially fun to contrast MyIshmael with IshmaelBook. They both tell the same story, but they're geared to different audiences.

* The Teenage Liberation Handbook (ISBN 0962959170) - Grace Llewellyn
** to see that there is a way out, and get many ideas and directions for finding this way.
