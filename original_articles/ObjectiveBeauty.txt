To someone who said objective beauty exists, but couldn't define what it was, see Blake Gopnik's February 8, 2004 article on the subject in the Washington Post:

Some flaws in the article
 1. Article has few scientific details(what was the control experiment, how many subjects were tested)
 2. Brain activity is easy to see, hard to qualify. The article did not tie that to other attempts at EKG/MRI brain activity experiments

''You only said that because the skeptical regions of your brain increased their activity.''

Not necessarily. It might have been purely anti-social. ;)
