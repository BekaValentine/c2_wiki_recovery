I'm a Ph.D. student at the UniversityOfKent.  I have just given the final draft of my thesis on RemovingGarbageCollectionSynchronization to the wizened and greying entity that is RichardJones.

I graduated with a B.Sc. from the UniversityOfGlasgow in ComputingScience and decided that I wanted to be a student but get ''paid''.  I'm now paying for my mistake...

It's now time to move into the RealWorld, and as such I'm looking for a RealJob, preferably something related to VirtualMachine or GarbageCollection development.  Failing which I think Borders might be a nice place to work.

''Update'':

I made it through my VivaVoce with no corrections, so I'm now the proud owner of a spanking new Ph.D.

I also start in the RealWorld this coming Monday, at MicrosoftCorporation.  Not doing GarbageCollection, mind, but working for the WindowsFundamentalsTeam, on various bits and bobs in the deepest depths of MicrosoftWindows.  WashingtonState, here I come!

Ha, I should be working on my dissertation proposal instead of working on this, but a friend told me about wikis and now I think I'm hooked!  

Too bad I'll ''never'' graduate because of wiki :o)

You could spend the first year of a PhD doing nothing but reading papers and wiki'ing and still graduate.  ''Trust'' me on this one...
