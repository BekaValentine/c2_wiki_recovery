Take an AmigaComputer, activate its narrator device, and execute this algorithm:

 volume = 10
 pitch = 440
 speed = 2

 for n from 1 to 100
	volume += 1
	pitch += 10
	speed *= 0.99
	speak (volume, pitch, speed, "Don't Panic!")
	sleep (speed)

The effect sounds absolutely terrifying...
