Not too long ago, a New Age writer proposed that the universe was holographic.  My wife is deep into this, but I think I remember the main gist.  Small patterns ripple up the ethereal geletin into bigger, somewhat synonymous patterns.  

The argument that he proposed that made me leary of all else that he proposed was that there was some holographic 'mind' operating on flocks of birds and schools of fish, for instance.  Please feel free to insert a quote if you've got the book.  I'm in another city from my wife right now.  In any event, this was supposed to explain the simultaneous turning of the masses in flight.  

Only one problem, birds and fish '''don't''' behave that way.  I had to compose a video of birds and fish in motion and single-frame advance it to make her believe that the lead animals turned first, then the second, and so forth.  It's just that they are specially designed to do this very '''fast'''.  

It boils down to, the man didn't investigate some of his motivating concepts.  And, since they were faulty, the rest of his unsupported claims have to be assumed so too.  

He saw a pattern, but did not do (or didn't want to) the investigation.  It turned out to be a FalsePatternOfHolisticMind, but a TruePatternOfResponsiveMovement.
