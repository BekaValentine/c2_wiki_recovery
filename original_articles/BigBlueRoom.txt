Virtually all computer facilities have a BigRoom nearby, and it is usually a BigBlueRoom. Depending on location, about one third of the time it is in use as a planetarium.

''It usually has very strange carpeting and a '''very''' high ceiling.''

Sometimes it has a grey ceiling and problems with the automatic sprinklers. Jeez, someone ought to complain to Building Management about this!

''On rare occasions, the lighting system experiences flashes. Maintenance hasn't had any luck tracking down this bug beyond tying it to the automatic sprinkler problem.''

''On the other hand, Maintenance has been hard at work on the rodent infestation problem. Rumour has it that they'll solve it any day now. Congrats, guys!''

''However, the location of the light switches and the climate control panel remain elusive.''

Heh heh. When I saw the title of this page, I expected it to be about a server room where only BigBlue equipment was allowed.

Commentary:
Depending on your POV (point of view), it is either ALWAYS or NEVER a planetarium -- i.e. regarded at those times when it manifests as a BigBLUE Room. It depends on one's attitude in regard to the REALITY OF THE INVISIBLE (e.g. small point-like celestial objects which generally cannot be seen when the BigRoom is brightly illuminated by the large yellow celestial object in the ceiling), and the IDENTITY OF DISTINCT APPEARANCES OF THE SAME PHENOMENON (i.e. the ceiling of the BigRoom, which may appear to be sometimes Blue, sometimes Grey, sometimes Black, etc.; but which is nevertheless regarded by philosophical Idealists (or is it Realists?) as "really" one and the same BigRoom at all times, regardless of the variable color of the ceiling...)

IME, most of the smaller planetariums spend very little time without the little twinkly lights on.
