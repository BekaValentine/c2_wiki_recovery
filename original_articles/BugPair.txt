This is the yin and yang of software debugging, when you find a bug (Yin) which is a genuine bug but has only shown up because of another bug (Yang).

For the term BugPair to apply, it must be the case that if Yang were fixed, then Yin would not be exposed in the particular use-case that first caught your attention.
