Brian Ball lives in Oakland, California with his wife of nearly five years.

He loves international communication, culture and languages, most likely due to his travel abroad since being a foreign exchange student in Recife, Brazil during the latter part of the 80's.

He's conversant in Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish and English and has to learn something new every day.

He's got several web projects "in the works" and is now completely distracted, having just found Wiki!

Cheers!
