The large volumes of pros/cons in the Great OOP Debate have generated controversy about how and where to organize and put them. Let's work something out and reach a consensus rather than get caught up in another placement EditWar (such as the one that erupted around Dec. 2008).

I propose we isolate common themes, such as reuse, project/app size, duplication reduction, mapping to mental models, encapsulation, etc., and put the pros and cons under each of those topics. Perhaps sub-topics in pages such as OopArgumentsDebatesAndDiscussion can be spun off if they reach say 4 screens worth?
