On the InterWiki page there's a delightful little note saying that a lot of work on a WikiSyntaxStandard has been underway, but the link was to this empty page.  

Is there such work floating around here someplace?  I'm about to embark on YetAnotherWikiImplementation and I have no reason not to use any WorkingStandard that may exist.
