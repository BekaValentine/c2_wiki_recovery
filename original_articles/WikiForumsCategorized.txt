... '''Refactored'''

Everyone,

If you have a favorite WikiForum, why don't you try classifying it and add it to the list? If it covers several topics, enter it in more than one category. (If appropriate, make a new category in the style of this list.) If you don't feel comfortable entering it in the list, put a note here with some description of its focus (and URL), and I will add it to the list. PS: When you enter the URL, pick a good starting page relevant to the topic, if you can. 

Aside: I will try to work my way through PublicWikiForums and copy those wikis to this list.

Page Reference: 

	* WikiForumsCategorizedAyThroughCee -- Mostly computer related at this time 

	* WikiForumsCategorizedDeeThroughZee -- Mostly non-computer related, but some computer programming is covered under other topics, see these categories: 

		* Personal and Miscellaneous Wikis 
		* Project Management 
		* Math 
		* Science: Biology 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A good way to classify things are with the OpenDirectoryProject categories at http://dmoz.org

See also CategoryWikiMetadata.

Have you thought about refactoring the local-wiki pages, so every wiki they reference has a local-wiki page? Then each page could have the something like:
	* CategoryWiki
	* CategoryWikiCategoryScience
	* CategoryWikiCategoryScienceBiology

on the bottom.  

I am not sure if it's better to use names like CategoryWikiCategoryScience, or if it's better to simply all the categories that apply to a particular wiki on its wikipage (i.e.)
	* CategoryExternalWiki
	* CategoryScience
	* CategoryBiology

Each category page could contain the OpenDirectoryProject category equivalent to the wiki category.
I have added those into the three categories above.

I can envision a day where wiki pages are all categorized, and wikis provide an RDF description of the wiki pages and a mapping (OnTology) from the wiki metadata into classifications used on the web, like OpenDirectoryProject categories. 
 
There is the RdfWiki for the advancement of rdf.

My desire for the "Learning" <computer language> forums is to list forums containing material to help a programmer familiar with one or more other languages learn this language as easily as possible, but not as a first computer language. That implies that there is room for another category of forums like Learning to Program, or a series of forums, LearningXxAsaFirstProgrammingLanguage. The "Learning" <computer language> forums are also intended to focus more on learning than using, or introductory learning rather than the continuous (advanced) learning that everyone needs to do in a language.

Fridemar, 

This might become duplicated in a table on WikiReviews, or possibly be replaced by that table, but, for now, I'm starting with a list. -- RandyKramer 

Randy, do you give permission, to transform some of your stuff into tables on the experimental WikiReviews forum, just for testing the practicability. As authentication [AuthenticationByWebsite], that it is really you, you could leave a pointer here to a static HTML page on your Website, where you formulate your permission (with a backlink to this Wikipage). -- fp 

Fridemar, sure, yes! However, I don't have an active website, and I'm not sure we really need to get so formal as AuthenticationByWebsite. Do you think we do? -- RandyKramer (PS: I'm not sure how long your note was here - just noticed it a few minutes ago.) 

Randy, in this case AuthenticationByWebsite may be overkill, because it is not critical stuff, but on the other hand for the same reason it would be practical to start serious forms of collaborations, based on non-critical stuff. The wiki explosion is lurking with quite a lot of potential in the professional (economy integrated) sphere. Have a look at my current validated search in WikiInternetSearchResults. -- fp 

Fridemar, 

I looked at your validated search, and it looks good. I have never tried CopernicTwoThousand but the automatic validation of links is sure to be useful. 

With respect to your other points, it appears that wikis may be in trouble in Hawaii, see link number 26 in your search results. (26. Endangered Species of Hawaii ;-) enjoyed that too -- fp 

More seriously: 

	1 Do you think those search results will be a replacement for this page, or do you think that they will be raw input for this page? Of course this page appears to me more valuable, but nevertheless you may freely copy material from the HTML-list to reuse it in a HTML capable WikiForum, e.g. the WikiReviews forum. -- fp 

	1 It would be nice to see a wiki explosion that resulted in some opportunities to make a living with wikis. The future of Ecommerce might be Wiki, specializing the CluetrainManifesto message: "The future of Marketing is Conversation" -- fp 

On a different subject, I have a question about Smalltalk that you might help me with. The wikis that I have seen so far written in Smalltalk do not include a diff. I got to wondering whether writing a diff in a language like Smalltalk (which I don't know, tried looking at a few weeks ago) would be especially difficult for some reason? Any insight? 

Oops: Never mind, WikiWorks 0.6 is written in Smalltalk (I think) and includes a diff. 

Thanks, -- RandyKramer (PS: As usual, delete anything no longer appropriate from these notes after you see them.) 

Randy, instead of deleting (prematurely), I reuse our temporary text for inserting and adding a link. -- fp

''I"m sure this page is useful, but it struck me as kinda odd that it indexes forums of one peculiar (or should I say particular?) format. If I'm looking for a forum, I probably don't care (primarily) what format it uses. Maybe KissPrinciple rules, but consider inviting mention of any kind of interactive forum. (I was thinking specifically of message boards. Dialup BBSes seem inappropriate.)''

Hmmm, this started out as an effort to categorize WikiForums (that were being listed under PublicWikiForums). I particularly like wikis, and want to encourage wikis as opposed to message boards. But, this is not my wiki. If people add message boards or whatever, I won't delete them. (That sounds more negative than I meant to sound, hey, the more the merrier - I will keep searching for and encouraging wikis.) If it gets overwhelming, it may be appropriate to refactor on some basis.

----

I see that the
PublicWikiForums
list has been moved to
the WikiIndex project http://www.wikiindex.com/
.

I'm planning on moving the information from
WikiForumsCategorizedAyThroughCee,
WikiForumsCategorizedDeeThroughZee, etc.
to that wiki.

Then C2 will be rid of WikiOnWiki clutter, and can focus on, you know, Serious Programming Stuff.
Like
the OneTrueBraceStyle,
whether or not ExtremeProgrammingIsNotTheOneTrueFaith,
FunnyThingsSeenInSourceCodeAndDocumentation,
etc.
