Actually, '''"the Royal Society for Putting Things on Top of Other Things."'''

MontyPython skit showing the prototypically useless executive committee. 

This year our members have put more things on top of other things than ever before. But, I should warn you, this is no time for complacency. No, there are still many things, and I cannot emphasize this too strongly, not on top of other things. I myself, on my way here this evening, saw a thing that was not on top of another thing in any way.

Folks in Staffordshire don't put up with this silliness.
(''"[...] most of the members in Staffordshire feel... the whole thing's a bit silly."'')
