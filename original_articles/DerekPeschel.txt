''Why I'm on this Wiki:''

I was lucky enough to start using computers at the early age of 7, and I've been (mostly) enjoying it since.
The Internet, and this Wiki, have a huge amount of information, but sometimes I find new "ideas behind the code" that make up for everything else.  I haven't explored the Wiki enough.

Between the projects on my to-do list and the "superproject" of prioritizing the projects, the Wiki is a low priority.
But I still think it's important to contribute a little when I can.

''Current programming project:''

Improving Climacs's regular-expression support (http://common-lisp.net/project/climacs/).  Learning CommonLisp in the process.  Wondering how to easily manage local changes to a ConcurrentVersionSystem repository.
