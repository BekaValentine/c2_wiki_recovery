KyleBrown and BobbyWoolf have been working to describe the 
Graphics Frameworks in each dialect of Smalltalk 
in terms of the recurring Design Patterns found in each.

For example, we have described how Composite is used in 
each dialect to represent "Views within Views".  We use
many more of the GangOfFour patterns to describe other
parts of the frameworks.  Finally, we tied the frameworks
together with a pattern we call PaperPenAndPerson.  
Another original pattern is a generalization of Observer
we called SelfAddressedStampedEnvelope.

We recently presented our results as a tutorial at the 
SmalltalkSolutions conference.  We will be presenting again
at OOPSLA'95 and at Object-Expo Europe '95.
