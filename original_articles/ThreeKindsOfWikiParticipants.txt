Although at times it is painful to see what happens here, it is a place where much in the way of collaboration takes place and where many new and worthwhile pages have been and will be created. There are those who quietly use the information found here and do not contribute to the making of waves and noise. 

It can be observed that there seem to be at least three different kinds of wiki participants. 
* The first includes those who participate, contribute, refactor and encourage others to do the same. They refuse to consign this ship to the deep. 
* The second group comprises those who merely pass thru and plant trees and flowers. 
* The third group comprises those who view this site as a place useful for ego gratification and other selfish reasons. 

I have confidence that the first two groups can be counted on to maintain the usefulness and tone of this wiki by being involved in collaborative dialogue and the enhancement of the page base. This will result in making this wiki a useful, available resource for years to come.

I think this is a gross simplification, categorizing "the good", "the bad" and the passers-by. There are many different roles one can assume and one can change from one role to the other, according to the situation. The problems start only when a person sticks to a special role (e.g., that of a "saviour" or a "top wiki expert") and this role isn't acceptable to the others and no agreement can be found. Expectations have to meet. -- HelmutLeitner

''Simplification is a GoodThing. It allows focus and directed activity. In the case of this wiki, participation, contribution, refactoring and encouragement are definitely what make Wiki work.''

This page was intended to illustrate three kinds of participation, not the roles decided upon at the moment by one, two or many participants.
