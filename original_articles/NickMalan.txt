Nick Malan has recently separated from the United States AirForce. He currently is working as a server administrator in Oklahoma. Jesus''''''Christ has been a driving force in his life and seeks a more intimite relationship with God. Jesus''''''Christ is king and ruler and I hope that one day all would come to know Jesus''''''Christ as a personal Lord and Savior. He is currently improving the content on his churches website. Check out his pasters messages on http://www.choctawroad.org .

I Googled on this name and located a NickMalan who might be the same person:

Nick is concerned about evangelism and has posted a video on G''''''odTube.

I changed from GodTube to Blip and trained our pastor on video upload

It is obvious that he desires to learn more about computing and using such technology in the things he feels strongly about. -- DonaldNoyes 20080130

Thanks for noticing my GodTube publication I hope that you will enjoy Rick's messages. My online "nick name" is Malan4God

Another large contribution I have made to the web is on a website called Geni. I have a family website with a large database. Geni has made collaboration within my family easy.

You had previously written "anything done by him only comes from God". 

Does this no longer apply or does it mean your poor spelling comes from God?

My Poor spelling comes from my lack of attention to detail. I enjoy contributing on the web and hope that those that read what I have pay more attention to what is being said and less on my grammer. Bad thing about IE is spell check is off. I have switched to firefox and google's browser but some of my older works have mistakes. Also if anyting I write is not at my home computer I use IE.
