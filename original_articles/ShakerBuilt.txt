HGTV had a show (Sunday, 2002/01/27) about the Shakers. They're famous as masters of "the simplest thing that might possibly work," but have a reputation as technophobes. Not so.

The Shakers invented, among other things, the circular saw, the washing machine, and the "flat" broom (the kind we have today). Not only that, they manufactured and sold them commercially.

Not only *that*, but the simple things they built are beautiful as well as functional, and have lasted (often in design, sometimes physically) for a century or more.

Sounds like folks we (software developers) could learn something from.  --PaulChisholm
