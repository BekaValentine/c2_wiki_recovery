Some have noticed a contrast between OreillyAndAssociates's focus on "application-oriented technology textbooks" and AddisonWesley's focus on "theory-oriented science textbooks."

Although Addison-Wesley does not publish ''Foo Bible'' titles (leave that to IDG ''et al.''), some of their more popular titles are subtly promoted as bibles by providing a ribbon bookmark in the binding. ;-> The DesignPatternsBook, RefactoringBook, and RefactoringToPatterns (''which has two'') are examples. There may be others as well. One could say that religious fervor has developed around design patterns (witness DesignPatternsStudyGroup''''''s) and refactoring (popular among ExtremeProgrammer''''''s). I'm going to guess, though, that the beribboned editions appeared ''after'' the religious fervor started. -- ElizabethWiethoff
