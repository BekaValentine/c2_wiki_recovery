HumorPatterns are the patterns in humor.
----
A little quotation from one of Ogden Nash's forewords is in order here:

 I hereby wish to scotch the rumor 
 That I'd attempt to write on humor, 
 For those who do fall into groups 
 Of solemn, pompous nincompoops 
 By whom a joke must be enjoyed 
 In terms of Bergson or of Freud... 

(Patterns should ''be'' funny.  Meta-humorous discourse not funny.) 

''Once formalized this will advance ArtificialStupidity significantly''
