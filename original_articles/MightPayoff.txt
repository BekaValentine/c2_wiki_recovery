A code-phrase for deprioritizing low-odds requirements without necessarily offending anyone. Used this way: 

	* ''Brent has a point. Adding a clickable border to this screen with links to our marketing material really MightPayoff. I mean I really like it. But first let's worry about making the screen link to the results we're selling. That's an ImmediatePayoff.''

This is a more polite way (but less direct) way of saying YouArentGonnaNeedIt.
