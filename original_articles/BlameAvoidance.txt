The acts or cultural beast within an organization of making decisions or assigning tasks in a manner that mitigates anything being blamed on anyone.  

''Collective crimes incriminate no-one.''

This can be encouraged by organizational practices that look for someone to blame when something goes wrong, rather than looking for things to change to prevent the error in future.

Most of the time you can tell when a company practices BlameAvoidance when its employees also spend inordinate amounts of time on ImpressionManagement.
