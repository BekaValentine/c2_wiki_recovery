If it was HardToWrite, it's supposed to be hard to read.

So throw it out and find an easier way to do it. HardToWrite means TooComplex, which means bad.

Case in point - I spent all of yesterday working on an essay. 7AM to 11PM. As I went to bed I thought - that was really hard. It really didn't flow. It's probably not much good, is it?

In the morning I started again, from scratch. Didn't even look at the old one. Had a fresh look at some how to write essay pamphlets and started again. Much much better this time.

There is a quote saying that writing in a simple and clear explanation is much harder, which fully contradicts the proposal: the harder it is to write, the more readable.
I think that part of the problem is the "lucidus ordo" effect: if one masters the subject, it is easier to write about it; conversaly, if it one has troubles to write about a topic, *maybe* it is because one doesn't master the subject.
I also think it is one reason why DocumentsFirstCodeLater is useful.
