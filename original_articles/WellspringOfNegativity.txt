[Sometimes ProgrammingIsNotFun, because]

	* It is easier to complain than to fix things.  ''You have a ChronicComplainer.'' (Or you '''are''' one.)
	* It is easier to find flaws than to create.
	* Some people feel that making positive comments is unnecessary, or "fake", so they only make corrections and negative comments.
	* Some people can't resist disagreeing, even with things they don't understand.  ''See PointyHairedBoss.''
* The lure of unfulfilled potential for our current project blinds us to our past accomplishments.
* What's right is simply right, that's taken for granted; what's wrong needs fixing, why haven't you fixed it already?
