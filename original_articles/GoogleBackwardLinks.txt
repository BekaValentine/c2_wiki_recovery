When on the page in WardsWiki, selecting Backward Links presents the pages which link to it, both within WardsWiki and those outside of it. (On July 2, 2004 it showed 213 links)

When renaming an/or deleting a page within WardsWiki, it is helpful to show the pages which will be broken (404) when the backlink is use on the referring page(s). If it is important to maintain referential integrity, this factor should be taken into account by wiki gnomes about their work and its effect on other pages and sites.

If you want the backward links otherwise, just enter, '''link:c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors''' in the Google search box and click the Google Search button. Substitute the pagename for WelcomeVisitors. The results are not exhaustive.
