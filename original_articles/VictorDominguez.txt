Welcome to my Wiki Home Page!!

I am a software developer from Mexico.

My Open Source Projects:

Code Generator http://codegenerator.sourceforge.net

It is a template base code generator. For this reason it can generate code for any text based programming language.
It is very easy to use because of it's own simple syntax.
