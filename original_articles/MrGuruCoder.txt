Notice that the requirement does not specify an upper domain. So modified the test for random values > 0. This way Mr. Guru Coder doesn't get lazy and implement any complex if statement. ''If statement nothing. A guard clause and a table lookup. -- MrGuruCoder''

In HighSchool, I played in "Reach for the Top" with some of my nerd buddies. The following (or something close) exchange took place for one math question:

	 :	'''Coach''': "Okay, what's [some long math formula involving an integral]?"
	 :	'''Me''' (buzzing in, hoping I can figure it out in my head): "Umm... two fifths." 
	 :	'''Coach''': "Incorrect."
	 :	'''My buddy''' (buzzing in): "One sixth."
	 :	'''Coach''': "Correct."
	 :	'''Me''': "Oh, two fifths, one sixth... What's the difference?"
	 :	'''My buddy''' (quick as lighting): "Seven thirtieths."
