I've added your IP to ReverseIpLookup because you do a lot of minor edits. After the spat over blue yonder's vandalism, I initially thought you were blue yonder. The entry is aimed at preventing another such misunderstanding. If you object to being known, feel free to delete the entry. -- RK

Sorry, but I post from random cubicles at my office. Frankly, I forgot about the option to set the right cookie. I'll do that soon. And, I never write anything I would be ashamed of. If I don't have anything nice to say, I don't say it. Okay--done.

[edit note] Sorry for moving this conversation here, I couldn't find a better place. And good luck with gnoming, do not mind the more excited part of the wikidom. One can find pretty good and reliable measures of when gnoming is justified - it improves the page for the WikiReader. -- Costin

Question -- If I am contributing to a page, and I see a programming example that uses a WikiWord that has not been escaped with six quotes, does anybody mind when I adjust the WikiWord so it is no longer a link? Or is that pollution? -- EricJablow
* Despite DV's comment, although it's not pollution, it's not always wise either; DanglingLinks can serve a purpose, depending on what it is. It's a judgement call. If the non-existent target page '''might''' be a useful page for someone to create in the future, that's a good reason not to adjust the DanglingLink. -- DougMerritt
** It was a random class name like M''''''yClass. -- EricJablow
** Ok. But bad example; the page "MyClass" exists! -- Doug
*** Is MyClass a good name for that page?  It doesn't indicate the page's content.  Something like CppForwardDeclaration would be better.  In the context of the page I was contributing to, MyClass had no meaning; it wasn't part of a ''class MyClass'' forward declaration.-- EricJablow
*** (A) I have no idea which page you were contributing to where you referenced MyClass, so I can't check that context, and (B) regardless of whether you think MyClass looks offhand like a descriptive name for the contents of that change, I have reason to be sure you didn't check its backlinks, which in '''this''' case may be an overwhelming reason to keep that particular page name. -- Doug
