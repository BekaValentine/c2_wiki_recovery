I like the way his poems

 who knows if the moon's        
 a balloon,coming out of a keen city
 in the sky--filled with pretty people?
 (and if you and i should
   
 get into it,if they
 should take me and take you into their balloon,
 why then           
 we'd go up higher with all the pretty people        
              
 than houses and steeples and clouds:
 go sailing
 away and away sailing into a keen
 city which nobody's ever visited,where
   
 always
           it's
                    Spring)and everyone's
 in love and flowers pick themselves
do that.

From the poem ''you shall above all things be glad and young''...

 I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing
 than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance
