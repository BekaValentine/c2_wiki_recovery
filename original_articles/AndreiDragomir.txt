I'm Andrei, student at FILS (UPB Bucharest).

I work as a software developer at InterAKT Online.

I found this site when searching for DesignPatterns on google. 

Mainly, I am interested in any kind of topic related to software development/software engineering. But that doesn't mean I know any of them extremely well. :)

I can be reached at adragomir _IHATESPAM_ gmail.com

I also publish (in a very lame way) the website at http://www.andreid.net

I don't really care much about WikiFeatures. I believe wiki is best left alone, without any unnecessary bloat (Wha's the difference between Royal Quarto and the back of a napkin ?)

Pages started by me : 
* PetalsAroundTheRose

Pages I often read
* PowerOfPlainText
* ( to be completed )

I have learned the RefactorMercilessly AntiPattern the hard way. But now I know better :)
