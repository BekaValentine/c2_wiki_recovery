'''Wiki:'''

Frank found the WikiWay in the late fall of 2000. It wasn't until the summer of 2001 that he realized the power it held for the realtime recording of information. This is largely due to the influence of NormKashdan.

Frank has caught W''''''ikiFever and is working on yet another clone of WardsWiki.

'''Farming:'''

Frank lives at Mooseview Farm, where he grows garlic and other veggies, works in his woodshop on wooden toys, and when cash flow is needed consults on many different software-related topics. Currently, WebServices is on the top of his list.
