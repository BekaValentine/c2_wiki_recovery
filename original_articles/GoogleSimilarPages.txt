Is the google "similar pages" feature useful? I've never seen the point.

Just now I searched on "howtowriteacompiler site:c2.com". The first hit was the c2 page (which oddly, didn't have a google cache link). I clicked on its "similar pages" link. Fourth on the resulting list is www.buck-rogers.com, which is a very amusing hit from one point of view, but not useful.

So, what am I missing? Does anyone use this google feature regularly? Those links are extremely prominent and taking up valuable real estate, so I keep thinking there must be '''some''' point.
