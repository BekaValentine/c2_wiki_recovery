	 :	"From water faucets and airplane cockpits to the concept of "real time" and the future of memory, this wide-ranging tour through technology provides a new understanding of how the gadgets that surround us affect our lives. Donald Norman explores the plight of humans living in a world ruled by a technology that seems to exist for its own sake, oblivious to the needs of the people who create it. ''Turn Signals'' is an intelligent, whimsical, curmudgeonly look at our love/hate relationship with machines, as well as a persuasive call for the humanization of modern design." (Back cover blurb)

Anybody labeled 'curmudgeonly' is my kinda thinker. My favorite chapter is "Coffee Cups in the Cockpit"

''Cars also use "body language", such as rocking threateningly before changing lanes. Can you tell I drive in LosAngeles?''

Back east, we called that the "New Jersey Turnpike twist".

Are you saying that in California and New Jersey people don't use their turn signals when changing lanes? They do everywhere else!
*'''I think they use their horns instead.'''
*''No thy don't, they just turn without warning, and you have to get out of their way.''
