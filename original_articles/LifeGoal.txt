Individuals can maximize life experience and their personal MeaningOfLife if they develop a MissionStatement then identify specific goals and subgoals to achieve their destiny. It is destiny because the seed of the vision (from which the mission derives) comes from within and beyond. JosephCampbell said "FollowYourBliss" - what you really want to do is what you should really try to do. Won't necessarily be easy but that is the challenge of life.
