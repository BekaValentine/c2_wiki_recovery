Searle, whose ChineseRoom was the first major critique of Strong ArtificialIntelligence, defined the term thus: ''According to strong AI, the computer is not merely a tool in the study of the mind; rather, the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitve states.''

This is not to answer in the affirmative to the question AreWeCode. But it is to assume that the VonNeumannArchitecture, and the TuringMachine model that underpins it, are the correct answer to the question ''What are we?''.

''StrongAi doesn't have very much to do with the VonNeumannArchitecture or TuringMachine''''''s. See InteractiveComputationIsMorePowerfulThanNonInteractive.''
