''Apache Cocoon is a Spring-based (since version 2.2 of Cocoon) framework built around the concepts of separation of concerns and component-based development.''  

''Apache Cocoon is an XML publishing framework that raises the usage of XML and XSLT technologies for server applications to a new level. Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX (SimpleApiForXml) processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on the SeparationOfConcerns between content, logic and style. A centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching top this all off and help you to create, deploy and maintain rock-solid XML server applications.'' http://cocoon.apache.org/

Cocoon lets you do pipelining of web services components and tries to separate out as much as possible content from presentation.  Delivery of web content is defined by a "sitemap", which expresses (in XML of course) how URLs map to content, in terms of: 
* Generators, which create XML as SAX events;
* Transformers, which transform SAX events into other SAX events (eg. XSLT);
* Serializers, which convert SAX events into binary or character streams (eg. HTML) for consumption;
* Selectors, which allow conditional processing (if, then, else);
* Matchers, which match patterns to resources; and
* Actions, which manipulate runtime parameters based on request and application state.

Cocoon 2.0.4 is now available and rock-solid enough for production. Some people are using it. Soon will be available the version 2.1.5 (milestone releases are available now).
