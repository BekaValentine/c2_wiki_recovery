* Besides, checkboxes can be shown only on children of selected nodes (Children Checkbox) 
* Hidden nodes - Capacity to work with hidden nodes. Nodes can be hidden in two ways:

* Alarms on nodes
* Better treatment of tables
* Improved treatment of links
* Multilanguage support
* New kind of virtual nodes: links to other nodes (Mirror nodes)
