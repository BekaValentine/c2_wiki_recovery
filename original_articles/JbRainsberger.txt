'''What'''

	* I write at http://www.jbrains.ca and http://blog.thecodewhisperer.com
	* I brought XP Day to North America co-organising five conferences from 2005 to 2007.
	* I wrote a book called "JUnit Recipes" (ISBN 1932394230).
	* I worked on a project with Toyota Canada Inc., which began as an XP project coached by MikeBowler. The corporate environment was not well-suited to XP, even though the project's planning and technical needs made XP an obvious choice. I estimate that we worked as an XP project for almost three months before we started slowly abandoning the XP practices, one by one. While I worked with Toyota, we stopped pair programming, stand-up meetings and collaborative design. Just after I left the project, automated unit testing was stopped. Although the overall experience was not positive, I learned a great deal about XP.
	* In response to complaints about the scarcity of tutorials on JavaUnit, I wrote one in 2001, which I didn't understand at the time acted as a precursor to JUnit Recipes.
	* I spent six months doing "XP for One" at IBM's Toronto Lab. I was the only member of my team and my manager helped with the planning. My technical customers were other developers working on my product, WebSphere Commerce. I described my experience in another presentation located on my web site.
	* I contributed regularly the JavaUnit mailing list from 2000 until approximately 2007.
	* As a response to witnessing repeated abuses of the SingletonPattern, I wrote an article in 2001 offering alternatives to Singleton. http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/co-single.html

'''Why'''

I value XP because:
	* I want a sane work/life balance.
	* I want to do quality work with quality people.
	* I want to give the customer what they need.
