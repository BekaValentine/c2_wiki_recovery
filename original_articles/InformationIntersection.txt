''Valuing Concepts by defining them'' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.20120605.20140304

This is a concept which involves D''''''ataCollectionStructures in uneven, differing assemblies of information established in and recovered from various locations. A considerable number of L''''''inkableObjectsActionsAndMessages, made R''''''eachableObjectsOrArtifacts in a massive Information''''''Universe.

Any link you may choose to use can be assigned a unique name to be used as the intersection. WikiWords are good choices because they are identifiers which have links which are either reachable, or can be made so.

Some examples:
* BusinessIdentifier

''I have no idea what you're on about, but it sounds interesting. Could you explain? To me, it looks like you're reinventing the notion of a "unique identifier" or "key", but I'm not sure. Does it involve an index, too? "[I]nvolving a DataStructure similar to a jagged array in the ... recovery of ..." stuff sounds like it.''
----
I have an idea which is somewhat foggy, but which I can imagine as having great potential for organizing information in new ways. For example BusinessIdentifier can be conceived as an intersection of the terms (which can also be thought of as avenues) "Business" and "Identifier". This intersection is unique and is of type_Information. If it is discoverable as existing in an Information''''''Array, the array can be said to have:
* An InformationType
* A singularValue as in "CunninghamAndCunningham" (particularBusiness)
and
* A seriesOfValues as in "PublicWikis" (businessType as a listArray or even a Uri or another InformationIntersection)

In addition to being an "identifier", it includes words which are "navigators" which serve as guides taking you through a series of intersections, thereby allowing you to arrive at a unique location or value, or at a location identifying a series of locations or values. As such they may actually lead you to create Reportable''''''Values, even to those including snapshots at a particular point in time, of artifacts which change with time. An example is the index in this wiki which is the InformationIntersection of an artifact called a page and the pages which point to it, which we call "BackLinks". Note that as such it uses words, not numbers, to relate the objects. When we navigate to the intersection Back and Links in an Information''''''Array or Information''''''Universe at a valuedIntersection, we will build the index for the valuedObject residing at that intersection.

''Yes, I do believe you are describing a key, as defined in the RelationalModel.''

You mean like this?

''Yes, exactly like that.''

Does the model above apply if the InformationIntersection is the name of a WikiPage, and the page includes many words which can act as InformationIntersections which allow a user to navigate to one of several LinkableLocales?

''Probably. What are "InformationIntersection''''''s" and "LinkableLocale''''''s"? This page doesn't make it clear.''

How would you illustrate this concept using the RelationalModel you suggest? How would you represent a typical WikiPage and its linkages as keys? Are you suggesting a model which instead of rows and columns is a multidimensional component having 3, 4, 5, 6 or many more dimensions?

''I don't know what you mean by "multidimensional component". One possibility would be the following:''

 pages (pagename pk, creationdate, content)
 links (url pk, pagename fk)
''I've used the convention of indicating primary keys with 'pk' and foreign keys with 'fk'.''

''Any number of alternatives would be equally viable, depending on your requirements and intended application.''
----
A wiki page can be said to be a sort of Information''''''Array because it is made up of words, WikiWords (which can be said to be InformationIntersections), processes and/or queries which are executed by identifying the particular object and by actualizing the InformationIntersection by clicking on it. (This holds true of those things which are processes associated with the page, such as BackLinks, FindPage, MoreAboutCodes, Save, CodeWord, EditText of this page (last edited July 19, 2010), FindPage by searching, or browse LikePages or take a VisualTour ....

I use a WikiPage to illustrate this, because it is easily understandable. Forms other than WikiPages exist such as  Information''''''Arrays, Information''''''Universes, URIs, Wiki''''''Sites, Categories and Classifications, etc. The only thing necessary in an InformationIntersection is that it includes at least two Artifact''''''Names. The intersection can contain almost an infinite number of Artifact''''''Names.

InformationIntersection''''''s may be arrived at as a Physically Reachable location - Geo.Locale (LatLon)
* Form example shown on ChrisGarrod's page (32.82541nw117.22279))
Navigating
* Process of navigating to a specific InformationIntersection moving down Information''''''Avenues, turning when required down a secondary avenue, repeating this process until arriving at the desired destination.
** Examples:
*** Earth_The Country_StateOrProvince_City_StreetAddress_NameOfPerson
*** JohnQSmith.PresentAddress: Earth.USA.MO.KansasCity.812W29
**** '' Each of the components in the above can also be considered to be "locales" or "domains" as well as "avenues".''
When the terminology is used in a InformationEngine where the components appear and are existing, reachable information links, they can be used as such.
