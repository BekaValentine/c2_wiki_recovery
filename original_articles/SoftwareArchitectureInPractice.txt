[ISBN 0-201-19930-0] From a review: A significant book on the practice of software architecture. Should be read by anyone who doesn't think that a Software Architect is an elitist scum and something evil to aspire to.

	 :	''Ultimately, the only problem with this excellent book, as with many covering software engineering topics, is that the people who most need the knowledge it contains won't read it.''

Who do you think need it, that won't read it?
