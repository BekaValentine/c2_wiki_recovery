Meeting Report 10 December 1998

Three persons were present to the meeting of "Montreal Pattern User Group".

The persons were:
Regis Brochu                    regis.brochu@pwc.utc.com
Jack Azoulay                    jack_a@iname.com
Patrick Hodoul (Moderator)      PatrickHodoul@Hotmail.com

The purpose of this meeting was to study some of the "Creational Patterns" from GoF book.

1/ Singleton (GoF-127)
We discussed mainly about the Singleton (GOF-127) pattern and found some questions and answers.
The purpose of this pattern is to furnish a way to insure that a single instance of a class will be created. Here are some relevant issues discussed during the meeting:

a/ How to destroy the singleton?
The singleton destruction isn't study in the GoF book.

b/ How to take care of multithreading?
The multithreading aspects shall be considered due to possible concurrent accesses on Instance method of the singleton class.

c/ How to suppress the switch statement in the sample p133?
I think we should take few minutes on the next meeting to answer to this question?

Next Meeting (01-13-99)

The next meeting is planned for the Wednesday January 13, 1999 at 6 PM. The purpose is to study some of the "Creational Patterns" of the GOF book.
