I gave up on caffeine. No not really, I didn't become addicted in the first place, so I couldn't have given up. I was lucky to hate the smell of coffee and as a teen strongly declined to drink coffee.

I liked CocaCola, but that somehow wore off. I today drink CocaCola only if I have headaches - the caffeine and sugar often helps. But that's really medicine like Aspirin.

I tried, but I got kinda......ZZZzzzzzzzzzzz

I gave up on Caffeine many years ago.  At the time I thought I was going to die.  I survived, and my life has been the better for it.  It really is an addiction that has a lot of side affects that one does not notice while in its grasp.

This accidentally brings an interesting question. If something promotes a side-effect that is not noticed at all while in its grasp but only after the withdrawal, can it be considered an after-withdrawal side-effect? If you only notice side-effects on, say, caffeine, after you have given up on it for a sufficient time, but this side-effect could not be perceived at all while you were at it, how much of a problem this side-effect represents in practice if you decide to get back on being on caffeine?

It's a slight paradox that has being bothering me for a while. In a way, it seems to be misleading to take this in consideration when deciding to give up or not on something, as it would only be perceived after you stopped it. If you KeepUpOnCaffeine, you won't get this at all (assuming it's not something that was having a considerable negative impact but you could not perceive for being under its effect).

What are your thoughts on this? Obviously, neither these kind of side-effects or their cause can be generalized but still, seems to be a reasonable subject.

*''It's like this.  I did not realize how much better my life could be, until I gave up caffeine.  I was suffering from a number of negative sides that I was not aware of.  What caused me to give up caffeine was that I got a little hint of remembrance of what life used to be like.  I realized that I had fallen into a pit.  I just did not realize how big of a pit it was until quitting.  I have had several instances of going back to caffeine, but each time I was quickly reminded of the negative sides.  I have not used any caffeine for many years now.  When I come across heavy caffeine users, I can spot them instantly, and I say to myself "That was me once, and never again."''
* I agree. It's not that there are no side-effects of caffeine (or alike behaviors and drugs like irregular/too short sleep, taking pain pills, ...) it's that these effects are often below the perceptive treshold e.g. due to their long-time effect, because of social factors ("Take these, it helps and doesn't hurt") or simply because the effect really is weak. 
* ''Concur one hundred percent. For me the turning point was reading some stories about actual drug addicts and realising that the caffeine habit is not of much difference: you are addicted not to the positive effects, but to the absence of negative ones.''

You can't take my coffee unless you pry it from my cold, dead, still-shaking hands! It does NOT make me hyper or agitated or paranoid, you slimy commie atheist Muslim bastards!
