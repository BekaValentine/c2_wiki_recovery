Feb/March 2013: Pages recently targeted and re-targeted by GV:

TopOnAbstraction

GreatLispWar

NodeJsAndHofDiscussion 

BradyBunchGridDiscussion has been restored, but roughly a week old. It looks like we'll have to keep our own copies in case GV nukes them again. 
* ''I've restored the most complete version that I could find in the history.''
* Thank You for your effort! GV is sooooooo frustrating.
