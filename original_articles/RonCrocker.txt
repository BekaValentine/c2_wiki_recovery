I'm currently a Fellow of the Technical Staff at Motorola
Cellular Infrastructure Group in Arlington Heights, IL.
I'm general chair for OOPSLA 2003.
You can contact me at mailto:Ron.Crocker@Motorola.com.

Prior to working at Motorola, I was at Bell Labs, and
worked with JimCoplien. Most of my experiences with
objects came from a brief intro as an undergrad and
some "hands on" work at BL "debugging" the very first
releases of C++ (If you think it's bad now, just think
what it was like in 1984!) 

I got interested in patterns at 
OOPSLA '93 from talking to Cope; my work at Motorola
had been related to software architecture, and patterns
seemed to be the natural thing for describing some of the
reasons behind decisions made in the architecture that
appeared in either the structure or philosophy but were
difficult to explain.

Finally, it appears that patterns are making in-roads with
the academic establishment, thanks to the work of people
like DougLea, JohnVlissides, GerardMeszaros and others
interacting with the academic crowd at places like ICSE.

I'm trying ExtremeProgramming in a project - I'm documenting
it in RonsXpProject. It's purposely abstract (see VagueVsAbstract so I won't get into
too much trouble with the lawyers.
