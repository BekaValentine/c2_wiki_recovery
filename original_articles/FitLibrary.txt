Is there any chance of a port of FitLibrary to DotNet any time soon?

FitLibrary is incompatible with FIT 1.1 (for instance the protected field columnBindings in ColumnFixture is a TypeAdapter[] in FIT 1.1 and a Binding[] in FitLibrary). What library should I use? (I don't intend to use FitNesse at the time, but I might use the FitNesse implementation of FIT if everyone is using it). Are both supported? Which one are you using (I'm using FIT 1.1.beta and I'm thinking if I should go to 1.1. or jump to fitLibrary, because I like the FolderRunner). AurelianoCalvo
