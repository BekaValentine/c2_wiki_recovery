Well, this is maybe the strangest thing I have tried on the net, or maybe more fun than strange... and maybe more interesting than strange...

Well, I don't know anything about editing text yet, so how will this look?

So, I'm in India doing my masters thesis in computer science. or maybe it is information systems, or for all I know, it has turned into some kind of degree in social medicine... but it's great fun!

Born and raised in Norway, where I stil live and breath with my ExtremelyGorgeous girlfriend MaritLedsaak. Love her!

My initial question is: What should I do with my life? Pursue an academic career? Become a devoted teacher? Start to work in the computer industry? 

If anyone can add a line or two to give me some advice or whatever, I think this wakiwakiwebthing already has proved to be the best invention so far in the history of, well maybe not mankind, but at least for a long time...

Hello Ivan, welcome to wiki. As far as advice goes, all I can say is: Be true to yourself, and follow your dream, wherever it may take you.

Well, thanks. Nice with some feedback!
I'm working in rural India and don't have much time for wikiexploring.

I'd like to set up a wiki site for my project when I get back to Norway... is this easy?
It seems like a good way of communicating with people from different parts of the world.

Hi Ivan, thanks for adding your globe-trotting perspective.

This Wiki runs on Perl source code which is freely available here in the WikiBase section. All you need to create your own wiki is the use of a Web server which allows the use of CGI to run Perl scripts. There are other Wiki clones written in various other programming languages. Some of them have other features. WardCunningham has written a book about how he set up this site [TheWikiWay]; larger computer bookstores should have it.

I can recommend some LifeAndWorkPlanningBooks. Good luck!
