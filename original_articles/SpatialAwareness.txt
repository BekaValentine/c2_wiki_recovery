Spatial Awareness is the awareness of a fully 3 dimensional space.

Many people have poor spatial awareness.  Along with the complicated equipment and safety issues of airplanes, this is why there are more drivers and less pilots.  You are comfortable thinking in two dimensions, because that's what you see most of the time when you drive, walk, etc.  

Artists and architects have good SpatialAwareness.  This is why they can draw a perfect human form without a reference, or design a structure that feels open, while in reality, it's the size of a Dilbert cubicle.
I found this one out while playing one of my favorite whacky deathmatch games.  I had Quake with a grappling-hook patch running.  Then I turned off gravity.  Suddenly, there was a whole new dimension to the game, especially if you have lava pits to drift into.  People with poor awareness would quickly develop a headache and get mowed down by the more aware people.

There is a debate whether people who are LeftHanded have better Spatial Awareness.

Sailboat racing tests spatial awareness on many levels.  Trimming sails requires a feel for wind flow.  Tactics and navigation require spatial awareness on a more macroscopic scale.  When considering weather effects like shore breezes, it is like dealing with curved space.  -- SteveHowell
