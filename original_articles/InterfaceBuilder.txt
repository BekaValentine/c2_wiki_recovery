Interface Builder was first written in Lisp by JeanMarieHullot in 1984 and commercialized in 1986 (though its first incarnation may have been named "SOS Interface".)  Hullot was hired by NeXT, Inc. where he created a similar tool for ObjectiveCee and the NextStep, launched in 1989.  Meanwhile, RickDeNatale was inspired by Interface Builder to write VisualAge, the Smalltalk IDE that became the EclipseIde.  See http://www.diigo.com/06fln
