A list of functional programs applied to real-world tasks maintained by PhilipWadler, where both 'functional' and 'real-world' are defined rather loosely.

	* ''Functional'' includes both pure and impure programs, i.e. some use of side effects is allowed.
	* ''Real-world'' means that the program was written primarily to perform some task, not primarily to experiment with functional programming (this includes languages used to write their own compiler).

Languages covered include Erlang [ErlangLanguage], Scheme [SchemeLanguage], Haskell [HaskellLanguage], OCaml [ObjectiveCaml] Clean [CleanLanguage], Miranda [MirandaLanguage] and Standard ML [SmlLanguage].
