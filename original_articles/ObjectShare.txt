* 1995 ParkPlace-Digitalk merger of two of the major Smalltalk vendors, ParcPlace Systems and Digitalk Corp.

* 1997 ParcPlace-Digitalk changed its name to ObjectShare.

The most significant products of the company were:
* VisualWorks 3.0
* VisualWave (an ST environment for creating Web applications)
* DistributedSmalltalk
* VisualSmalltalk 3.1
* PartsForJava

Parts for Java is a Java IDE (I believe it was actually the first IDE for Java). It is an outgrowth of Visual Smalltalk and has tried to bring some of the features of the Smalltalk world to Java. Especially notable is the Class Master that allows one to browse classes much like in Smalltalk.
