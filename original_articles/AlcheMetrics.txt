"Our business is dedicated to the analysis and development of automated trading systems, typically applied against US Stocks and Index Futures. Since June 2000 we have worked to built up a suite of development tools and a variety of automated trading systems that are now in use on a daily basis. We actively trade these systems but we do not, as yet, offer them (or the analysis tools used to create them) for sale on the open market."
