A WikiTag I've used to try to indicate that I'm lost, confused, or uncomprehending of what someone is trying to say, and yet feel that it's my fault for not having the right mind-set or background to understand what is probably obvious to the author.

An example of its use is in AnOutsidersReviewOfWiki.
