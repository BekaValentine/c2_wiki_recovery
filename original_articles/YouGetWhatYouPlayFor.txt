''[You Can Tune A Piano, But You Can't Tuna Fish.]''

I use this pattern phrase when talking with clients about their investment in the future with the products they are developing. "Making a play" for a larger market or greater customer satisfaction will eventually "play out" for them in the long term. It is a rare thing when one of them buys it. Oh, well. -- MartySchrader

Oh, by the way -- after REO Speedwagon did their album by this page's name the phrase became something of a cultural phenomenon amongst young people. Now all those young people are OldFart''''''s, and some of us are still using this idiom, along with some others:

	* "Roll With The Changes" ''and'' "Keep On Rollin'"
	* "Ridin' The Storm Out"
	* "Keep Pushin' On"
