A FlameRename is when someone on a wiki takes a page and renames it to start a flame. 

For example if one is personally offended by a page (even if the page isn't intended to offend, is humorous, and isn't directed at anyone specifically) a FlameRenamer will flame the page by renaming the page, just for the sake of renaming it and ticking off other people.
