You can check out my tech home on the web here [http://clabs.org/blog] and my not-so-tech web home here [http://cministries.org/blog].

Currently, Chief Architect at eInstruction [http://einstruction.com] in Denton, TX (north of DFW) doing some Java and .NET development and overseeing some starter Scrum process.

I'm mainly experienced in Windows desktop application work (heavy emphasis on DelphiLanguage), with some RubyLanguage and DotNet [nitty-gritty here: http://clabs.org/resume.htm and here: http://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismo]. I'm an 'executive' (i.e. inactive) admin of the OpenSource DUnit (see DelphiUnit), played a brief role in getting Watir rolling (was WebTestingWithRuby) and have a few OpenSource contributions at http://clabs.org/scrpware.htm. I'm also (in)active with the DallasPractitioners. 
 
I've written an article titled "Introduction to Extreme Programming" that was published in the Borland 2001 Conference CD, July 2001. 
	* Part One: The Case for XP [http://clabs.org/caseforxp.htm] 
	* Part Two: XP Practices [http://clabs.org/xpprac.htm]

Some Wiki blame falls to me accordingly: 

	* ExpensiveSetUpSmell
	* XpConceptsInAcceptedMethodologies
	* LoadFactor
	* ProjectVelocity

I'm also a Dvorak nut (http://clabs.org/dvorak.htm) & play a mean jazz piano.

        * That'll do. Ugly ones as well: http://www.cministries.org/cstudios/improvsessionone.htm
