'''Installation'''

The installation documentation refers to a command '''pip'''. This is not the '''pip''' which is obtained on UbuntuLinux by doing this:

  sudo apt-get install pip
which installs a different '''pip'''. Instead the following are needed:

  sudo apt-get install python-pip
  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
Then it is possible to install Lettuce using

  sudo pip install lettuce
as given in the Lettuce documentation. The two versions of '''pip''' seem not to be compatible. -- JohnFletcher
