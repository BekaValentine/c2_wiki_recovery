The main problem of servlet design is that code on the server side has to emit HTML. Are there any IDEs that allow real wysiwyg interface design?

Actually there is: '''VisualAgeForJava'''. It includes a tool called the ServletBuilder that allows you to construct Servlets in the VisualCompositionEditor the same way you would applications or applets. Unfortunately, it's an idea that never quite caught on--and for good reason. I'm not so sure it's a good idea. 

The way it '''operates''' is that it has a framework that parallels Swing that generates HTML from widget classes. These are dropped ''WYSIWYG'' on the workspace. Now, the problem is that the whole widget idea has a flaw: those widgets take up a lot of memory, and quite a lot of what you would want to do with them can be better done through JavaServerPage''''''s. So that's why IBM doesn't promote the ServletBuilder much anymore...
