This is the list of software applications a lot of us would like to see for the SharpZaurus: 

* A small wiki 
* A good email client (thunderbird?)

''Try MiniRubyWiki and a Ruby port (for example http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/46111).  See http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/10/22.html#a92 for one account.''

Thanks for reminding me.  I forgot to add Zwiki to the good software list (and it is good software).  It's there and ready for you to use.  See GoodZaurusSoftware
