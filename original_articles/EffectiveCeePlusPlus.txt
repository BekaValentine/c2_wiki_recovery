ISBN 0-201-92488-9

The first two editions of Effective C++ were embraced by hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. 
The reason is clear: Scott Meyers' practical approach to C++ describes the rules of thumb used by the experts - the things they almost always do or almost always avoid doing - to produce clear, correct, efficient code.

Each of the book's 55 guidelines summarizes a way to write better C++, and the accompanying discussions are backed by concrete examples. For this third edition, more than half the content is new, including chapters on managing resources and using templates. Topics from the second edition have been extensively revised to reflect contemporary design con-siderations, including exceptions, design patterns, and multithreading.

Important features of Effective C++, Third Edition include:

* Expert guidance on the design of effective functions, classes, inheritance hierarchies, and templates.

* Applications of new "TR1" standard library functionality along with comparisons to older "classic" standard library components.

* Insights into differences between C++ and other languages (e.g., Java, C#, C) that help developers from those languages appreciate "the C++ way" of doing things.
