Mount Rushmore (http://www.nps.gov/moru/) is a NationalPark in the USA which has carved in it (very big) the faces of four former presidents - from left to right:

* George Washington - the leader, the aristocrat who loved his fellow man - eyes straight across, surveying this country of his 
* ThomasJefferson - the sphinx, the philosopher president, eyes raised to heaven
* TeddyRoosevelt - the grandpa, the storyteller, the adventurer - eyes smiling at the children at his feet
* AbrahamLincoln - the tortured soul, the reuniter, the courageous solitary figure - eyes lowered in the disbelief of fate

Located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The entire area is worth a visit if you're a nature lover. 

''Although I read that the carvings are cracking or eroding or something. Anyone know any more?''

''Unless they bring the mountain inside, or figure out some way to control the weather there, these things are pretty much guaranteed, aren't they? Being newly exposed stone the faces will probably weather very quickly at first, probably in an alarming, even if not significant, manner, then settle down to the same steady decay as the rest of the mountains.''

If you visit the monument, you can travel a little and watch the construction of the statue of the amerind leader Crazy Horse on a nearby peak of the Black Hills. He's riding a horse, and with one great outstretched arm he's giving Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt the finger. -- PCP

''If you are in South Dakota and want to see ''true'' Americana, the CornPalace in Mitchell is a must see.''

I suppose we're not going to count Stone Mountain: http://www.stonemountainpark.org/

'''''Are there equivalents in other countries?'''''

An English equivalent might be the Cerne Abbas Giant, a hill carving that evocatively depicts the more prominent aspects of English culture. The pint of strong lager in the giant's left hand seems to have eroded away over the ages :-)

Not to mention the "Long Man of Wilmington."

In the Philippines the dictator Marcos had a large bust made of concrete on a mountainside in the Benguet province. When he got overthrown they blew it up: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2612709.stm

It is a bit like the StatuesOfLenin, but not as easily toppled. -- OleAndersen

Saddam Hussein is the latest tyrant to have enormous self-aggrandizing statues toppled.

In other news, New Hampshire's natural rock formation, the Old Man of the Mountain, has just passed away (May 5 2003). http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20030503-1304-oldmanmountain.html

No wonder the old man went away. With a flag stuck in front of his eyes (see link above), it's no wonder he went for a better view.

They want to put the rock face (pun intended) back together? It could never be the same. It would be a mockery of rockery. It is sad that a tourist attraction is no more, but that's all part of life.
