The effectiveness of a TeddyBear can be shown by a true story:

While in college, an associate was bemoaning that his girlfriend was out of town.  He had bought her a teddy bear as a gift for her return.  That evening, he and I and another friend had dinner at a local place where we were wont to eat, and play Spades (a bidding card game).  Someone suggested we play, and when I objected that we had only 3 players, the teddy bear was nominated as my partner, but played by his owner.  The game proceeded, and the bear player bid a blind nil on one hand.  Three tricks later, he picked up the bear's hand, stared at it, and muttered in disbelief "The bear's set my nil!"
