''Work that is not done yet.'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110905 20110919

This describes a work that, while it is not complete, it can contain presently useful information in the interim between its present form and that which would make it more complete.
----
Because a work is incomplete does not detract from the parts of it which stand alone having no dependency upon the parts of it which are not complete, or do not exist (as in WantedPages or BrokenLink''''''s).

This wiki should be considered such: an IncompleteWork, valuable as is, while it is moving toward a more complete state.
