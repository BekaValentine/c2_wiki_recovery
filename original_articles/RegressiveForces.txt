'''Personally Acquired and Initiated Regression'''

Two current forces which are mainly self-initiated RegressiveForces are DrugAddiction and Alcoholism.

'''Externally Imposed and Tolerated Regression'''

Not to be ignored are aspects of social, educational, economic and political forces which are mainly other-initiated. These forces can become RegressiveForces when they lead to personal and/or societal dysfunctioning. 

'''Escape is possible'''

One does not improve and move higher up the HierarchyOfNeeds when one is satisfied with the status-quo and has neither personal incentive, satisfaction or goals. One captured in such a spiral is in need of caring intervention, where encouragement, direction and accessibility is provided to allow reversal of the forces.
