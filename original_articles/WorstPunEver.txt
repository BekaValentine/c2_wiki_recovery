What is the difference between a pun and a fart? One is a shift of wit, the other.....

Some of the puns on this page are worth a groan. For the aficionado there are still more horrible ones in places like the Xanth series ("The magic washing powder ran out. So she had to run out and chase it.") not to mention the CallahansCrosstimeBar series ("Mick and Mary Finn came in. A sawbuck." ''[a 'fin' is antiquated slang for a five dollar note; a sawbuck is a ten dollar note. So two fins are a sawbuck. Boooo....]''), as well as the GoonShow, MontyPython, and even a memorable stinkeroo or two on a Prairie Home Companion.

There was also a radio series "My Word" (um, 1950s? 60s? ''nah, it's current and you can hear it on NPR in the United States'') which always ended with two comedians each having to come up with a story that explained the origin of some phrase. And, as it happened, the stories were always very absurd and ended with a pun on the phrase in question.

But the height I'd mark was set in in the early eighties by the infamous Australian radio series "Doctor Poo", a 3-minute-per-episode satire on the British TV series DoctorWho. The eponymous Doctor, a "Time and Toilet Lord", sailed about the universe in his turdis saving the day through the most horrendous puns ever committed by supposedly human beings. 

The very worst involved an intervention into the affairs of the nefarious Captain Knee Moss, who kidnapped 10,000 tourists under the pretence of a Freddy Laker cut-priced tour of the south pacific. Powering his submarine by sticking the tourists' legs out through specially gussetted holes in the hull, Knee Moss forced them them paddle across the ocean floor like deep sea galley slaves. 

The doctor and his faithful assistant, Dana Sock, recoiled in horror at the laser-beam intensity of Knee Moss's inhumanity: "but that means ... ''Twenty Thousand Legs Under The Sea!''"

Depending on your admiration of puns, this page might be better named "Best Pun Ever".

''I admire some puns, but not the ones here. In general, a pun in the background or one that fits naturally into a conversation can be excellent. But if you have to have a fifteen minute story where they guy is dragging around a goat for no reason other than telling it not to be a hero at the end, it doesn't belong anywhere other than this page.''

These aren't really puns, they're more Shaggy Dog stories.

And the pun pattern where you respond to words ending in "er" with "I Hardly Even Know Her!"

The best reply to a pun is: "That's so punny."

''Best? That's my vote for the WorstPunEver, and the one most likely to get you hit. Pun-ished comes as a close second. Use something less formulaic, but use it OnceAndOnlyOnce, that's the rule.''

Or is that PunsAndOnlyPuns?

Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are sitting in the study, enjoying a nice quiet evening after having solved a devil of a case. Suddenly, Holmes jumps up, grabs a lemon from the fruit basket, wrestles Watson to the ground and attempts to cram the lemon up his behind!

Well, try this. There's a football (as in, soccer) team in Scotland called Celtic, who are always near the top of the league. And there's another team called Caledonian Thistle, who are always near the bottom. Anyway, one fine day they two teams were playing each other and by a fluke Cally beat Celtic! One newspaper reported this under the headline ''Super Cally go ballistic, Celtic are atrocious''.

There is a third rate carnival in town. They are a small outfit and most of the employees had several roles including the fortune-teller, who was also a dwarf billed as the "world's tiniest woman".

Ferdinand Feghoot was a guest of honor at ConJose last year. Unfortunently, he was unable to attend the awards banquet, because along the way his Dimensional Extrapolator failed, and when he stepped outside he found himself, not at the convention center as expected, but in a world occupied by numbers. 

Feghoot explored his surroundings curiously. Across the street, a 3/4ths played soccer with an attractive young 5/8ths, while a stern-looking 16/25ths watched in silence. Other numbers slid around the area, screeching about fractions that had recently been halved and screaming about friends' plans to exchange common denominators. The cacophony was so deafening that Feghoot had to plug his ears with his index fingers. 

In the sudden silence, he noticed the most amazing thing of all: A decimal point rolled down the road, followed first by one three, then another, then another, then another, creating a very long train of .333333333. Indeed, Feghoot realized, the threes continued out to infinity. 

Feghoot unplugged his ears, approached the first three, and said, "Greetings! I'm a visitor from another world, and I must say, I find you fascinating. Are repeating decimals such as yourself common here?" 

A mouth on the decimal point opened, closed, and opened again. Feghoot thought he heard a distant scratchy cough, but he couldn't make out any words. Then the decimal point tumbled away down the street, followed by its trail of threes. 

"My," said Feghoot, "but that was very rude." 

The 16/25ths across the street heard him. She shouted, "What more did you expect?" 

Feghoot cringed at the noise and plugged his ears again. "I had hoped he would answer my question," he said. 

"But he did!" Her five wobbled in anger. "You just couldn't hear him, for he doesn't speak very loudly." 

"Why not? All of the rest of you talk with, ah, rather adequate volume." 

"Of course we do," she said, "but then everyone knows that fractions speak louder than thirds."

A doctor from Madrid retired and followed his dream: playing golf for the rest of his life. One day on the links, he noticed that one of the foursome up ahead appeared to be swooning. He ran up to the golfer, who was leaning against his caddie, clutching his chest.

"I think you're having a heart attack!" the doctor said.

"No, it's just some indigestion," gasped the golfer.

"Listen, I used to be a doctor, and you're having the classic symptoms of a heart attack!"

"Just let me be, and I'll be all right."

As it turned out, the golfer ''was'' having a heart attack, and keeled over at the next hole, dead.

The doctor sadly trudged back to the clubhouse, where he related his story to the bartender.

"I told him he was having a heart attack, and he didn't believe me! Why wouldn't he listen?" sobbed the doctor.

The bartender replied, "I know what you mean. I'm from Barcelona, and I used to be a doctor myself. It's like they always say: no one respects the Spanish ex-physician."

(Asimov - Death of a Foy)

That one would have been much better in context. Here's another one from an IsaacAsimov short story, only this time I'm adding some context. A crook, Mr. Stein, steals some money and uses a time machine to travel into the future, arriving one day after the statute of limitations expires. He is arrested and the prosecutor and defense attorney argue the case before a judge. The judge's ruling reads, in full, "A niche in time saves Stein." (Asimov told it better than I just did, only he used far more words.)

He had another one about a planetary dictator who was looking for an anthem. He held a feast to try to decide upon a properly glorious one.

Bets are made and the race is off. All of the creatures are wriggling/sliding/whatevering down to the other end of the track, but Teddy just sits there. But at the last possible moment, the rock suddenly teleports and appears across the finish line ahead of everyone else. Sloane's Teddy wins the race.''

The doctor says, "Hmm, let me look," and proceeds to scope the man.

"Aha!" proclaims the doctor. "I see the problem. You have an abscess on your colon."

"An abscess?" asks the man. "What should I do?"

"Why, nothing at all," says the doctor. "Everybody knows that abscess makes the fart go 'Honda.'"

Version #2

A man went into a bar and asked the bartender for a glass of his licorice-flavored aperitif.  The bartender advised against it, but the man insisted. The bartender just shook his head as the man finished his drink, complained about really needing to pass some gas and then ran outside.  While he was gone, it sounded as though someone yelled the word "HONDA".  When the man returned, the bartender handed him the bottle, said that he had tried to warn him and then pointed to the warning on the label, "Absinthe makes the fart go Honda".
