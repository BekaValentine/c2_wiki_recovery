Been in the software business for awhile now. 

Started with a 10 year stint at IBM Research where I dealt with everything from NaturalLanguageProcessing to OS/2.

Worked for several startup companies usually in the Architect/CTO capacity. Started my own company -  Mobile''''''Spear, and eventually ended up forming XPand Software here in Israel.

Been doing XP since 2K, laughing at my erstwhile approach to programming and the Accoladed Architect Role.

XPand Software which was started by EranPeer and myself does XP coaching, lecturing on software engineering and InSourcing projects using XP. Actually, we do IndustrialXP (IXP). Actually, we do our variant of IXP. 

We are having fun.
