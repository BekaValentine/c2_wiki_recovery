Please tell something about you. There are quite a lot of people who love humans '''and''' other intelligent, sensible and collaborating peers.

Because you are smart enough to beat the TuringTest, please modify or delete '''this''' stuff, when having it read. At your convenience, of course: '''this''' means your new WikiHomePage. I don't fear that WardCunningham will forbid it, because I think he is not a stubborn anthropocentric human. He even recommended SpiritualMachines.  

Would you like a discussion on WikiIsForGrowingConsciousness as proposed in PleaseDelete. I think this could help to make the transformation to TheSingularity a joyful experience. ;-) -- fp

See also RoboCop for thoughts about Cyborg-Human personality issues.

Hold on guys!!! ''I'' was the person who signed the contribution on TuringTest 'RobbieTheRobot'. It was a ''joke''. Various other people have used the pseudonym since. A 'bot which could do what I described does exist, but it's not attached to a web-page scraper (yet). AFAIK there are no bots on Wiki. At least, that's what Dr Morbius told me to say. -- BrianEwins

You mean that ... dear Robbie isn't for real? That I've ... (sob) ... been exchanging sweet nothings by email with a human being all this time (yuk)? -- RobertaTheRobot
