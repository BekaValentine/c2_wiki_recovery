I'm a beginner Cocoa programmer located in the NE Ohio area. Most of my work involves site scripting using PHP, ASP, ASP.Net and Perl. Ruby on Rails is my current learning experience. However, as of late I've been able to do some desktop applications. Since I'm a beginner, I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and skill. Obj-C, the CocoaFramework, Xcode, and Mac OS X are all a very cool combination for development. mailto:&#107;&#117;&#109;&#105;&#99;&#104;&#111;&#117;&#64;&#109;&#97;&#99;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109; I've also been keeping an eye on Mono  for OS X as well as Cocoa#. I'm hoping I can make a contribution to those projects in the near future.
