InfoGlut is basically unprocessed, badly processed, or irrelevant information. When people have to deal with InfoGlut, they cannot absorb it, feel that it is incoherent or are overwhelmed by a whole bunch of superfluous detail.  Think of it as a metaphor for unnecessary fat (glut) but for information.

InfoGlut is NOT InformationOverload.  Even if the information is well processed and presented (Ha!), people can be overwhelmed by a large amount of information to absorb.  People usually find it easier to absorb large amounts of well presented and processed information versus a large amount of equivalent InfoGlut.
