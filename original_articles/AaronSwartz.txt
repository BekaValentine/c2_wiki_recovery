Hmm, I should probably set up a WikiPage...

I've always loved Wikis. In fact, I'm working on my own system (hopefully with the WikiNature) called BlogSpace.

More on me at http://www.aaronsw.com/ or send email at mailto:me@aaronsw.com.

I should probably link to some pages here... I was blown away by PatternLanguage, I'm good friends with SeanPalmer, love working on the SemanticWeb (especially hanging out with DanConnolly, TimBernersLee, and all the rest), know PhilipGreenspun and won his ArsDigitaPrize, I'm a fan of EdwardTufte, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember right now.
