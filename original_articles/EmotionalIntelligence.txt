EmotionalIntelligence is a topic of intense interest since the 1990 work of Mayer et al. It became a popular media topic after the 1995 book by Daniel Goleman of the same name. Corporations in US were quick to pick up on the NextBigThing, and Daniels "Harvard BS" article became a hotly requested item. 

As Daniel appear to be an accomplished publicist and a prolific author, I have created a separate page named SocialIntelligence to explore the SocialDynamics of EI in an organisation, sans the religious aspects. Overtime hopefully we can have better knowledge about ourselves, our limitations and become more enlightened.
