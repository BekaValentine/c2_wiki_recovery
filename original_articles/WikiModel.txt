A wiki is constructed using a model consisting of structures, actions, features and linkages which allow it to become '''"WhatItWantsToBe"'''.

A wiki can use a simple model as is used here on WardsWiki, being useful for a certain time and continuing times as a the minimum proving to be UsefulUsableUsed, or it might be one which has features which allow it to be a WikiWithMoreThanPages and/or a WikiWithMoreThanUsers.
