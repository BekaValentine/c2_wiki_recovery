I am working with De Nederlandsche Bank and as part of a pilot project we are considering an XP-adaptation of the RUP process. So far we've gotten consensus on PairProgramming, UnitTest, ContinuousIntegration and OnsiteCustomer. There was a BigDesignUpFront since we are actually rebuilding an existing application, but due to uncertainty both on how to actually create a UseCase and on how to deal with the new EJB platform it is now fading ;->. 
We are now trying SpikeSolution''''''s, and I hope to be able to play the first PlanningGame within the next two weeks.

I'd like to say ThankYou to the XP community for sharing their thoughts, optimism and courage. I'd like to thank AlistairCockburn for his book on use cases, since this sells good to a community that wants to do RUP.

My main interest is framework and application building while getting rid of all incomprehensible rules. I am an optimist by nature and the XP style of tackling problems very much appeals to me.

I am more than willing to contribute to a Dutch XP group. Anyone can reach me on one of the following addresses:

	* mailto:m.m.van.der.voort@dnb.nl  (work)
	* mailto:mark.van.der.voort@acm.org  (personal)

apart from that I will report progress on our project on this page and on the mailinglist.
