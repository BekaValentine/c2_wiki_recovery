A simulated working environment used to test business processes and IT systems with business processes to check that they: 

	1. Satisfy their functional goals (''e.g.'', you can produce the monthly sales report using the system) 

	2. Meet their performance & quality targets (''e.g.'', you can produce the monthly sales report in under an hour with no mistakes)
