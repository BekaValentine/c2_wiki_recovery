Have you ever read some person on the Wiki say "I'll add this tomorrow." or "I'll expand on this tomorrow."?

Tomorrow? The page was last edited years ago! The eternal WikiNow isn't much compared to the Wiki Tomorrow.

''Can you give an example of such a page? I can't find one.''

[There are lots, but it's not clear how you would search for them, since the phrasings can be highly indirect. For instance, the other day I filled in a URL that AlistairCockburn only '''implicitly''' said he would eventually provide, years ago; see the first comment attributed to him on InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives and my "news flash" after it.]

[Ok, he doesn't imply "tomorrow" per se, but it's the same concept: no followup ever happened.]
