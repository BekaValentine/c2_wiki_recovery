Someone else can do a better job than I can writing about this group.

See http://www.pdxlinux.org, but really you ought to go to a meeting, first Thursday of the month, to find out what this group is all about.

Also, WardCunningham's presentation of Wiki was one of the best presentations I've seen at PLUG.  Thanks Ward.
