A LopLanguage is a language used in programming for naming functions (and variables) consistently. It consists of words (e.g. ThelopWord''''''s) and rules (e.g. ThelopRule''''''s) to form names (e.g. ThelopName''''''s). The goal of a LopLanguage is to describe functions completely, so that the meaning of some part of sourcecode is immediately understood by the reader.
