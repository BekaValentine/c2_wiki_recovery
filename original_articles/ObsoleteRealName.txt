Ozzy Osbourne's real name is John Osbourne.  But just try and get him to turn around by saying "JOHN!"

Most of us can think of a few hundred celebrities who have changed their names.  Some of them just wanted to make a bigger impression (Whoopi Goldberg) or a lesser one (Larry King).  Some particularly pretentious pop stars have become one-word names, like Madonna, or Cher.  

[Celebs often change their names because they have to, the ScreenActorsGuild requires names to be unique.]

''Comedian Albert Brooks given name is Albert Einstein...no wonder he took a stage name.''

Some people change their names when they change religions, like when Madonna became Esther, or Cassius Clay[sic?] became Mohammed Ali[sic?], or when Marshal Applewhite became Do.

But, does anyone here know an actual flesh-and-blood human being that simply does not answer to the name on his birth certificate?

* ''Only one: http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,491/''

* ''Plenty.  Some simply because they don't like it, some because they wanted to be seen differently than their given name would present them.''

* I've been told that many people who adopt a child give that child an entirely new name. That child may not even know the name on his birth certificate before 18.
