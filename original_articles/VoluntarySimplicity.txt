VoluntarySimplicity, by DuaneElgin.  ISBN ???

I enjoyed reading it, although it seemed a little abstract.  YourMoneyOrYourLife is probably a better book.

But, as to why this came up - "Marketplace" was on the radio the other day, and they were doing a piece about the "VoluntarySimplicityMovement". It struck me that voluntary simplicity has values in common with extreme programming -- YouArentGonnaNeedIt, most obviously, but perhaps also OnceAndOnlyOnce and DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.
	 :	Do your UnitTest''''''s fail in the morning?  Need help ReFactor-ing your life?  Well, at the ExtremeLiving training school, we can help...!
