As a software engineer, I'm interested in information organization and presentation, domain modeling, and good software engineering practices  (no cowgirls or -boys, please).  
As a domestic engineer, I am always creating three-dimensional objects out of the abstract, and an very involved in using and creating patterns.

Creating useful, beautiful, and well crafted items is what makes me sing.
Enjoying the company of my 2 dogs and the ancient kitty is what makes me smile.
