At http://zhurnaly.com/cgi-bin/wiki --- MarkZimmermann's online journal, aka ''"'''^zhurnal'''"'', an experiment catalyzed by WardCunningham & BoLeuf via TheWikiWay ... the '''''ZhurnalWiki''''' is a "live" Wiki version of the bloggish site http://zhurnaly.com/ ... see WikiJournaling for comments on that process.

Oh, ''zhurnal'' simply means "journal" in Russian, and ''zhurnaly'' is the plural "journals" ...
