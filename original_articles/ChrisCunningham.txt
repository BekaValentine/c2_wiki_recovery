Brilliant. I wish I had that kind of vision. Then again, maybe I don't. The nightmares alone would be worse than an Ed Grimly childhood. I recommend watching ''Come to Daddy'', his debut music video, done for AphexTwin. Disturbing. Or ''Afrika Shox'' done for Leftfield. I don't recommend ''Frozen'' done for Madonna, or ''Windowlicker'' for AphexTwin again, which was just bizarre. -- SunirShah

''Why not? I thought that Frozen was very visually appealing. the sparse black-and-white look was perfect for the stark electronic sounds of the song.''
