What can I say? 
Great if you like Mike Myers - intolerable if you don't.
I didn't stop laughing all the way through.

I must be perverse. I loved the original, but I think the sequel is one of those MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts. -- PeterMerel

Agree. I loved the first one, but thought the second sucked. The potty "humor" just doesn't do it for me. Also, ElizabethHurley (who stays within her acting ability limitations) '''crushes''' the performance of HeatherGraham (who has no discernible acting talent whatsoever). -- AndyPierce

The original is a wonderful spoof of spy movies; the sequel is an ungodly train wreck of a film. 

Two comments I've heard that I enjoyed: "It's not clear whether Phantom Menace will earn more money at the box office than Titanic did, but it is certain that Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me will out-gross all other movies this 
year"; and, "It's not so much 'more of the same' as just 'the same'."

Actually, less of the same. Just btw, the admittedly brilliant original was still derivative on other spoofs; note the PeterSellers portions of the late-sixties James Bond spoof, "Casino Royale", especially the rotating-bed geek-glasses ruffled-shirt pelvic-thrusting scene with Sellers and Ursula Andress. ''Worth noting too that "Casino Royale" is a really dreadful film; there's only one perfect spy spoof, and that's OurManFlint.''
