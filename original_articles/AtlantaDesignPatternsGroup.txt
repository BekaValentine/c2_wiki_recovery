The Atlanta Design Patterns Study Group meets every other Thursday from 7:00pm to 8:30pm at the Sun Training Center (near Perimeter Mall).  We have a different topic for each meeting and someone volunteers to lead the discussion.  We tend to lean more towards Java, but the meetings are open to anyone who is interested.

Our meeting schedule and meeting topics are posted to the group site.  Directions to the meetings are also available.  If you have any questions, e-mail atlanta-dpsg-owner@yahoogroups.com.
