''[From ClearCaseComparedToCompetition:]''

''alienbrain'' is a "Digital Media Management" tool that's like VersionControl for MultiMedia. As of ca. 2001 Q1, it seemed to be the best/biggest in this arena. Spendy, but very very nice GraphicalUserInterface for the artists.

We've used Alienbrain where I work for a few months now, and have had numerous problems with its merge checking: very frequently users aren't prompted to merge on checkin after a multiple checkout, and the current server version of the code gets overwritten by the user's new version. Either everyone in our office is stupid and dumbly ignores the big 'you need to merge stuff' dialog that usually pops up (unlikely), or there's some bugs in there somewhere that keep screwing us up.

Alienbrain also seems to have issues with the timestamps on files sometimes; not quite sure what's going on, but despite a perfectly normal working environment with 1 server and a number of workstations, AND alienbrain's own automatic time synchronisation, workstation time / server time mismatches still seem to happen - e.g. you check a file in, then get latest version, and alienbrain says your version is newer than the server version. Huh?!
