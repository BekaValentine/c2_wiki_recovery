My real name is Sean O'Halpin. I am a Senior Software Engineer in Audio and Music at the BBC.

We use RubyOnRails, Perl and Scrum.

I am particularly interested in patterns because they confirm that philosophy and aesthetics are essential aspects of systems design.

My favourite computer of all time is the Sinclair Spectrum - 48K of pure magic.

Lastly, thanks to all the people who have made WikiWikiWeb the enthralling place it is.
