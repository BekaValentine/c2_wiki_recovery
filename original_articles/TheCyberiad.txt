''Fables For The Cybernetic Age'' by StanislawLem. The story of the machine that could make anything starting with the letter "N". The world's stupidest thinking machine. Endless stories within stories. Mymosh the self-begotten. And so on. Vastly important reading.

I don't know about important, but certainly one of the best f/sf books I've ever read - and the fables have really useful morals too. I often tell people about the "perfect adviser" when they don't want to do what I suggest.

StanislawLem profoundly influenced RobRepMan & the TFLS. Retroactively. -- PhlIp
