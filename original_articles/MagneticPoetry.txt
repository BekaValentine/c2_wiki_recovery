We're creating a group poem at work. You are assigned a day of the month and on your day, it's your turn to add a line to the poem. You can use the words that we've accumulated, or you can make your own word by rubbing letters onto blank magnetic strips.
''Why magnetic?''

Magnetic words just add another dimension of fun to writing.  They attract some people who have adverse reactions to poetry per se, but become mildly interested in the challenge of making something meaningful from an assortment of single words put in front of them.  

This is our poem so far . . .

	 :	It was a dark and stormy night;
	 :	Morning's arrival was luscious and green.
	 :	All the cows were out of sight
	 :	And the frogs were feasting on a bean.


	 :	The armadillo sipped wine from a perfect shell,
	 :	The liquid made him feel warm and weak.
	 :	Was this a dream, a magic spell?
	 :	No, it's the fantasy of a computer geek!

	 :	Imagine the shadow of morning's soft whisper
	 :	Silently weaving dawn's early chill
	 :	Open cocoon, my thoughts start to wander,
	 :	Breaking free, the day's promise to fill.


''"In one sense a note will do as well-"''

At my previous employer I had very positive reactions to an idea I called PoetryCorner. Every thursday I would send a poem to the whole department. I tried to pick a wide variety so that there would be something for everyone. Often people would email their reactions to the poem or send back poems that the first poem had reminded them about. On occasion somebody might write something and send it as a reply. It was fun and always upset the stereotypes other departments had about programmers.

Sounds great as long as you put 'Poem' in the title of the mail message so I can set up an appropriate junk mail filter. :-)
