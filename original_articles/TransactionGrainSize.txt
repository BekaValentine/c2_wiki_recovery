The amount of worked performed as an AtomicUnit.  Transactions can be fine-grained in which a very small amount of work is performed (e.g., set a string) or a large amount of work (e.g., bulk insert into a database).  Grain size is subjective and opinions often vary from task to task and programmer to programmer.
