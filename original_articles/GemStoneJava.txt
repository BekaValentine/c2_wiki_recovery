GemStone/J (GS/J) is a product of GemStone Corp. It's basically the Java version of the GemStone/Smalltalk (GS/S) product that has been available since the late 1980's. The Java version is an EnterpriseJavaBeans (EJB) container, but it also contains a persistent store (i.e., an object database), which makes it unique in the JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition (J2EE) space. -- BobbyWoolf
