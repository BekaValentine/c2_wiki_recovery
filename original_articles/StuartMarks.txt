I'm a software engineer at Sun Microsystems in Silicon Valley. I work on Sun's JavaMicroEdition (Java ME) implementations. I've been lurking here for a while, reading things like ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap and OoDesignPrinciples. I've attended the OOPSLA conference for the past few years, including OopslaOhFour and OopslaOhFive, and I hope to participate in some discussions about events at that conference, and others in the past and in the future.
