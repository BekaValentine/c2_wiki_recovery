For several days I have had the same experience that many people have reported here over the last 2 months - can't reach the site at all.

Hmmm - this may help.
Looking up the swiki.net domain via "whois" leads to the owners at http://www.advantive.com/

That site has contact information, and the home page currently says:

''Advantive Associates has operated the popular Swiki.net and NetUnify.com collaboration services since 1999. In 2002 the number of registered users of those services grew to more than 6000. Development of those services continues and Advantive plans to roll out version 2 of Swiki.net and NetUnify.com in 2003.''

This is also curious, though many networks filter out ping packets:

 $ ping swiki.net
 PING swiki.net (69.60.176.11) 56(84) bytes of data.
 From 66.0.192.196 icmp_seq=1 Packet filtered

We need to get a backup of some data posted in www.swiki.net. Anyone know the e-address of the site administrator?

A WikiFarm from WikiFarms at http://www.swiki.net allowing you to open free WikiForums.
The use is free of charge and works great. It has been free for several years now.

Swiki.net offers WikiForums in three main flavors, presuming a free psw for the site:
	* semi-public (everyone can read and write)
	* semi-private (everyone can read, but not write)
	* private (only invited persons can read/write)

'''Great site''' generally, but......

	* your wiki readers have to register with Swiki to edit. This is cumbersome if you have a low-security site where you want to encourage instant one-line edits. ''You can do this by inserting an edit field with a plus sign (+) at the start of a line.''
	* there is a bug that resets private readers access. Re-inviting doesn't help, because the information gets lost after one or two days as well. ''yes, they wanted to fix this bug in march 2003, but I think nothing happened. if you want to start a public wiki or a private wiki just for you, you don't have this problem. for a workaround for a private wiki to share with others you can give them your user name and password.'' - Can anybody confirm or deny whether this problem persists (June 2004)?

I enjoyed http://www.swiki.net (SwikiFarm) in the following ways:
1) to have a members only wiki where pages are viewable and editable only by members
2) you could create a wiki for use without having to do any administration
3) It was on their boxes. (My box cannot stay up 24/7)

I've set up 3 wikis today (25Jun04) on swiki.net - sadly the members only doesn't appear to work (you have to send an invitation from within swiki and that is not working). Very easy to get going...

I'm using it and seems quite efficient.
