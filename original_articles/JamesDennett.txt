I am a software developer/software development manager, having previously worked for 4-Sight, WAM!NET, Escape Velocity Technology, BakBone Software (http://www.bakbone.com/), Cabot Communications (http://www.cabot.co.uk), and Technocom (http://www.technocom-wireless.com/).  I'm now living and working in Seattle; my current employer is Google (http://www.google.com/).

I have been a committee member of ACCU (previously the Association of C and C++ Users, http://www.accu.org/ and http://www.accu-usa.org/), and editor of their journal (C Vu), but retired from those positions some time after moving from the UK to the US.  Since 1999 I've been a moderator of the newsgroup comp.std.c++ .  I also contribute a small amount of my time to the GCC project (http://gcc.gnu.org/).

My normal starting point when browsing the C2 Wiki is to go to RecentChanges, which I guess makes me a mere RecentChangesJunkie.  I'm also a recent changes junkie for my company's internal wiki.

Software-related interests include programming languages, networking, protocols, software engineering, software testing, cryptography, and scalable systems.  

More importantly, however, I had the best girlfriend ever, who is never errorful and always wisdomy.  (Ha, let's see what the spell checker makes of that) but does have a tendency to lapse into German without meaning to.  Let's remember that, fun though technology may be, it's not the important stuff.  In her wisdom, she agreed to marry me.  That's the important stuff.
