Some pages on Wiki seem to generate more heat than light. They devolve into "is not!" "is too!" debates that don't seem to accomplish anything. Perhaps they could benefit from a cooling-down period. What pages do you think fit this description?

Please put entries in alphabetical order. Also, please don't delete reviews that you disagree with (DisagreeByDeleting); rather, add a rebuttal. This has been done to excellent effect several times on MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts.

Also, no fair commenting on a page that you haven't actually read (at least a significant part of). If you stopped reading after a pageful because it was so bad, that counts as "reading" it. If, however, you just don't like the page title, that does not. At any rate, no fair piling on widely-acknowledged-as-bad pages unless you have actually made an attempt to read them yourself. Otherwise, we could ALL trash DefinitionOfLife and such. Hey! I liked DefinitionOfLife. Much better than MemesShmemes.

I went all squinty-eyed when I tried to follow DefinitionOfLife. Tried to figure out a way of participating without losing a finger or a hand. Eventually concluded I'd just take a different approach altogether - and somewhere else - and wrote the initial version of DefinitionOfLifeDeclined. Interestingly, whereas DefinitionOfLife gets mentioned in various contexts, its *declined companion seldom (never?) does. I was struck by the amount of effort spent trying to effectively "define time by examining a clock" so I reasoned that we could begin at the other end of the domain. Of course, neither of them is a shining example of "on topic" material.

All in all, I would agree with Peter that the original page is a mindsore. At least the the other (*declined) page took a more civil path, where the dissenter(s) simply concurred that I was off my rocker. Oh, well. It's only heresy. E pur si muove. -- GarryHamilton

I consider PagesToAvoidAtAllCosts much too strong. I believe, that there is no kind of communication, that should be avoided entirely (and by the way: avoidance is, if it can be observed, a kind of weak communication too). I would prefer to rename this page to PagesToBeCarefulWith. I think that the above pages all qualify for that and the usual suspects agree with that. Also being careful puts oneself into the necessary detached mode to treat the topic objectively (hopefully). -- GunnarZarncke

''clearly this isn't about avoiding those pages entirely. the first thing i did, and i suspect many others did, when i saw this page was to revisit each of the pages to see how truly bad they were. ooo the irony -- JamesKeogh''

If it isn't, then you obviously agree that the name is wrong :-) Also the list becomes less of a controversy.

''agreed''

* I like colorful wiki names. They attract content. And if I'd just called it "PagesThatSmellBad" it would have missed out on the movie analogy. ~ Pete.
