Ben Richards works for AG Communication Systems in Phoenix, AZ, and was
illuminated by JimCoplien at a Pattern Writing Workshop that he and BobHanmer
consented to put on here.  I work in the General Processor Unit group
which worries itself about GTE's cash register.  That is, we handle billing
data that is generated by the GTD-5 EAX central office telephone switch.  DonOlson
runs around here somewhere, and made quite an impact with his HandsInView pattern.

I graduated from the University of Illinois at CU (BA '91, MS '94), but never
had the fortune to work with RalphJohnson while there.  I was lucky enough to
attend his Patterns course during ISSS this year, and gained another perspective
on patterns that's not quite as wacky (wiki?) as Cope's.

I can be contacted at richardb@agcs.com for business purposes, or at
benoba@indirect.com for silly mischief.
