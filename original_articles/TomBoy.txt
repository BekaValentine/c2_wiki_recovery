Another WikiAsPim and WysiWiki.

This one in C# on Mono: http://www.gnome.org/projects/tomboy/

'''Review'''

Simple, useful, usable, beautiful and for personal use.

It is a cross between Post It notes and a personal wiki. Every note  
can have text, but a WikiWord makes a link to another note. There  
is no edit/browse modes. You type and read in the same time/space.  
Also, there are no server or browser needed, nor any special  
installation instructions. It just sits in your system tray,  
waiting you click or type your keyboard (configurable) shortcut.

Current features:
* Search
* Recent changes
* Text formatting (font size, color, bold, italic, highlight)
* No versioning, yet (08/2005)

Many modern Linux distributions include Tomboy because it is an official part of GnomeDesktopEnvironment. 

''I run SuSE 9.0 and when I try to run '''./configure''' it's telling me I don't have '''mcs''' installed. It appears that it's not available. Can I get a pre-built installation?  Or do I have to go through a massive clog-dance?''

Mcs is the Mono compiler.  Install mono and the mono development packages if you want to build TomBoy from scratch.  Mono will definitely be available for Suse because they are both made by Novell.
