Wiki on a Stick that lives in one self-modifying HTML file.

Use it in your home or office computer, laptop, USB pen drive (along with Portable Firefox if you want) and even in a diskette!

It can be used as a personal notepad, calendar, repository for software documentation, and many other things.

Check the forums for betas and more recent activity.

Easy to install and use! Ideal for note-making-and-storing (on whatever media)
* and since it is html, it is adaptable across platforms
