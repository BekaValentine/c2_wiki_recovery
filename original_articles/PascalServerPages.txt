There are two PascalServerPages that people know of. 
----
One is for CGI programs (fast ones too), a web helper unit for FreePascal. This one is in active development and progressing. It is now called Powtils and is located at http://z505.com/powtils/idx.shtml
----
The other is an internal version of the Jedi interpreter, and is at http://npascal.sourceforge.net/. It is a modern pascla scripting system.
