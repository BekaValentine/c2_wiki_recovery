'''is''' a specific form of dogfooding
* using your own creations on your own personal site that you depend on, day to day
* Metaphorically speaking, a person's ideas must be the building he lives in - otherwise there is something terribly wrong. 
**  SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard - introduction to Provocations

'''has''' several required components
* the first two of which it shares with dogfooding:
** active creation (whether code, UX, interactive/visual/graphic design)
** use of that creation (e.g. by your company)
    
'''use'''
* you yourself personally using your creation for your own personal uses 
** it's not just part of your day job that you shut off when you go home
* self identification/dependency 
** using your creation in some manner that represents you, your self
** part of your primary identity on the web
** act of creation alters an aspect of the public "self" of the creator
