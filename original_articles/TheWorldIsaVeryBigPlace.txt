Hmm, I thought this page existed - something similar must be out there.

Along the lines of "There are more things in heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy."  Different people think in different ways, and the best thing you can do for them is:
	0 give them tools to work in their own way, and
	0 don't impose your way of thinking on them.

If you can accomplish '''both''' of these aims in a small, clear, simple and easily-understood-in-its-entirety system then you can conquer the world.

My answer to IfSmalltalkIsSoGoodWhyDoesNobodyUseIt is that it seems to force me to work in its world, and I prefer my own heavily crafted editors and a fast '''make''' cycle. Smalltalk doesn't work for me, even though I love programming in it, because I can't work in the environment I'm forced to use.

''Doesn't reliance on your own, heavily crafted tools have a bad effect on PairProgramming?''

The original idea of PairProgramming with two people sharing a single keyboard, mouse, monitor, computer ''and environment'', yes. We use a modified form where people write code in their own editor on a different virtual desktop. From either side a single click saves the code and runs the tests. We swap virtual desktops constantly, but we each have our own environment in which to edit.

I think differently from the majority of programmers. It's a genuine difference similar in kind to AspergersSyndrome, and so I use different methods. PairProgramming can still be made to work.

The reverse, from DoctorWho (City of Death):

	* Scientist: I am the greatest expert on temporal science in the world!
	* The Doctor: Really? Well, the world is quite a small place when you compare it to the universe.

(Someone fix if they have a better memory).

So maybe also: TheWorldIsQuiteASmallPlace ?
