I propose a collaboration and OpenSource effort to standardize and impliment collaboration objects as an extention of WikiWiki.

It would employ the notions of semi-structured text (ThomasMalone), active text, interface languages, content addressability and collaborative objects.

I hope to make WikiWorld a testbed for this effort.

I am working on it at http://WikiWorld.com/wiki/index.php/WikiObjects but will work here if there is interest.  You assistance will be greatly appreciated.
