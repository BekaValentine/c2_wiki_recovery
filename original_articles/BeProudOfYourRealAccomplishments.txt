Pride goeth before a fall and all that -- but it is certainly appropriate to take satisfaction and pride in your real accomplishments and TellPeopleWhatYouDid.  The world would be a dreary place if you couldn't "Blow Your Own Horn" -- besides, it's fun!  I think one of the best ways to do it is to CelebrateYourAccomplishment with a little party.  -- RaySchneider
