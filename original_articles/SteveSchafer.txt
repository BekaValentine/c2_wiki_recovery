I am a freelance software developer, using mostly DelphiLanguage, with a bit of Java here and there. I also dabble in various aspects of FunctionalProgramming. (I've even implemented LazyEvaluation in a parser written in DelphiLanguage--I was amazed at how much it simplified the task of parsing.) I serve as Chief Technology Officer for Fenestra Technologies Corporation (http://www.fenestra.com/), a software development firm located just outside the beltway in Germantown, Maryland, USA.

I recently moved to Ohio (http://www.state.oh.us/), after living in Oklahoma (http://www.state.oh.us/) for eleven years.

I used to be a physics professor at Oklahoma State University (http://www.okstate.edu/), but I eventually decided that the academic life was not for me. I now work at home. This gives me the decided advantage of not having to wear clothes while I work. This is especially beneficial during the summer. While I work at home, I sit in an AeronChair.

I am interested in all aspects of software development, from methodologies (e.g., ExtremeProgramming) to SoftwareConfigurationManagement to ProgrammingLanguage''''''s. I still haven't found the time to sit down and learn Smalltalk.

My wife is a professor at Ohio University (http://www.ohio.edu/), where she studies nervous system development and physiology in ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' (http://elegans.swmed.edu/), a common nematode that lives in the soil. It's used as a model organism to study basic physiological processes that are too complicated to study in more complex organisms.

When we're not working (which doesn't add up to much), we're usually birding (http://www.americanbirding.org/).
