[By the way -- does anyone know of some Red Dwarf content that doesn't ''require'' Java just to view it? The official site was created by someone who knows nothing of proper Web protocol when creating user interfaces, apparently.]

[The above (minus the two "GARBAGE POD" quotes) is the standard opening/exit song of the show.  Compare to "star ship Enterprise, who's five year mission..."  ;->  ]

For those of you who haven't figured it out from the above, and I salute you if you haven't, RedDwarf is a hilariously funny parody of the StarTrek genre. It stars a cretinous peon, an anal-retentive hologram, and a mutated cat. And that's the good part...
----
And don't forget the real star of the show, Holly, the not very bright AI in the computer....

''Holly has an I.Q. of 6000. The same I.Q. as 6000 high school phys. ed. teachers.''

''...or 12000 traffic wardens''

	 :	Holly: "Oy!"
	 :	All: "Oh, go away."
	 :	Holly: "That's done it.  I forgot what I was going to say."
	 :	BAM!
	 :	Holly: "Oh, that's right.  A meteor's about to hit the ship."

Through a bizarre set of circumstances, they're a grillion miles from Earth.
They're trying to get back, even though it will probably take longer
than many of them will live. There's also a main character who is a hologram,
who in later seasons gets a fancy device that lets him wander around
more freely. Does anyone else see a disturbing similarity to StarTrekVoyager?

''Yes, Voyager also ripped off GallForce (see janeway's hairdo at the start of the series, and compare it to Captain Eluza's. The difference? One of them has pink hair)''

There are also four books that are based on the series: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, Better Than Life, Backwards and The Last Human.  They are not just novelizations of the show and are also very funny.  The first starts off:

Explain, using diagrams where appropriate, the circumstances leading to your death.

''Death isn't the handicap it used to be.''


''C'mon you re-e-e-e-ds!''
