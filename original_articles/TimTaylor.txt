''What do you mean by "TimTaylor software candidate"?''

TimTaylor is a FictionalCharacter that stars in a fictional TV show, ToolTime, portrayed by a real person, TimAllen, in a real TV show, HomeImprovement. One of TimTaylor's hallmarks is his penchant for better and more powerful tools (which he usually mis-uses -- the show is a comedy). The show plays on such stereotype material as the ToolBelt (an American "guy thing"), and having more toys (tools) to hang from one's ToolBelt. Wives have been known to remark of their husbands browsing through tool shops and hardware stores, "you're a regular TimTaylor" (in search of the ever-more-powerful tool).
