-- pages on the need to think about what you're about to do, before pounding out the code:

Deep introspection...
	*SourceCode
Right before hitting the keyboard...
	* ThinkThenCode - Across methodologies, it's recommended that you think before acting.  ''(...along with XP arguments with approaches of other methods.)''
	* ExtremeThinking = How XP requires you to think before you code.
	* RecordThinkingInTests -- (if done before coding)
	* ThinkAsYouCode = a short XP response to ThinkThenCode.
	* ProgrammingIsThinkingToo - suggests prototyping.
	* TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign
	* SourceCodeIsUserInterface (for you and those after you)

Some time before hitting the keyboard (at a higher conceptual level)...
	* DavesRealExampleWhereThinkingAheadWouldHaveHelped = an argument against DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.
	* FuturePerfectThinking = a more abstract theoretical concept.
