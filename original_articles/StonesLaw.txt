Named after OliverStone, director of such acclaimed films as ''Platoon'' and ''Wall Street'' (not to mention utter rubbish like ''U-Turn'' and ''Natural Born Killers''--YourMileageMayVary).  Deals with conspiracy theories (see GrandConspiracy).

The law states:

'''Any evidence which opposes (or tends to oppose) a conspiracy theory was in fact fabricated by the conspirators, and shows just how pernicious the conspiracy really is.'''

The above may seem silly, until you get into an argument with a conspiracy theorist who attempts to use it against you.  At which point you should realize that you're more likely to convince a chair of anything than your opponent.
