'''Don't settle for success, strive for Significance'''
* reportedly to the the seventh and most important guideline for personal success in Rob Parsons book "TheHeartOfSuccess" (ISBN 1840325070)

''"The great use of life is to spend it on something that will outlast it." - a quote from James Adams  ''

My colleague and I both have not read the book (nor heard the cassette). We were speculating what is meant by Significance that is ''beyond success''.

Our guesses are:
* Significance is a success that lasts, for example, a L''''''egacyOfSignificance
* Significance is an achievement that you are proud of, whereas success is recognition by others

''So what is the right answer? And why?''

Having not read the book, either, I would speculate that the difference is as follows. One can be successful at doing almost anything, but does that success have any significance, any value, any meaning? For example, one could be very successful at project management, but if the projects do not result in anything of true value, was the success significant?
