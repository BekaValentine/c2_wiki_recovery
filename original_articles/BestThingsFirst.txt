A practice found in WorryDrivenDevelopment. If you do the riskiest, hardest things first, you'll miss early commitments, and people will think your development schedule is out of control. Therefore, do the things that are slam-dunks, that you can deliver on-time or early, putting off the more difficult, risky features until later.
