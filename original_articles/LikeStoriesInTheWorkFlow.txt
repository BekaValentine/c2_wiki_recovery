LikeStoriesInTheWorkFlow, these are the days of our lives.

time is passing
measured by a tracker
with a 3 by 5 ruler

getting over
getting made
getting done
giving up to fight another day

Everything you are 
everything you know
everywhere you've been is in
that cardbox
monolithic near his desk
always in shadow

am i a little nugget of business value
or just a little bit of duplication?
