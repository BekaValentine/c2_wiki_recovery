Windows Script Host (WSH) is a Windows administration tool.

WSH creates an environment for hosting scripts. Given a script in one of the supported languages, it makes objects and services available for the script and provides a set of guidelines within which the script is executed. Among other things, Windows Script Host manages security and invokes the appropriate script engine.

WSH is language-independent for WSH-compliant scripting engines. It brings simple, powerful, and flexible scripting to the Windows platform, allowing you to run scripts from both the Windows desktop and the command prompt.

Windows Script Host is ideal for noninteractive scripting needs, such as logon scripting, administrative scripting, and machine automation.
