AKA Jungle

UK music scene, starting up in the early 90's. The music is almost entirely produced on computers using samplers, synthesisers and sequencers.

The sound is a product of the clash of HipHop, rave and reggae sounds and is at times heavily influenced by Jazz. - One great example of Jazz DrumNBass is the group 4Hero. A large amount of their music is created live, rather than using computers.

Some of the most famous names are Goldie, LTJ Bukem, Roni Size and Photek.

Sadly now decaying into Heavy metal with a slightly off beat in Two Step Jungle genre, although many more interesting directions keep bubbling up, like, as an example, Drum'n'Bossa.

Could be considered to be a precursor to UK garage. Some DnB producers have ?gone over? to garage, in search of fame and fortune. Sadly many women punters have moved into Garage as well.

''More than one music critic has noted that the shift from DrumAndBass to UK garage has a socioeconomic subtext as well; DrumAndBass parties used to be populated by young poor kids with dreadlocks, baggy pants and cannabis, but garage parties tend to involve a lot more designer label clothes, jewelry, and champagne and cocaine. Another manifestation of the recent WealthEffect, perhaps.''

''To timeframe it, start it up in the mid-'90s in the UK, with a crossover to Toronto, Canada (?!) and then the US soon after, to the split into the garage scene, a UK phenomenon  of a couple years ago. More or less.''
