Notes:

Adopted WordPress as a WebLog (though I was really looking for something like a WikiLog - maybe).

Older notes:

We've been using OpenWiki for a while at work.  
The primary advantage in using OpenWiki is ease of setup.
Setup was easy as I could just use one of the Windows test machines running IIS.
Securing the wiki was easy as IIS can authenticate against the Windows domain.

Downside in that OpenWiki is a bit slow on the 400Mhz machine in use.
The Perl-based wikis I'd tried at the time seemed as-bad or worse.
Wonder if anyone has tried to measure WikiPerformance :).
Looking for a better-performing wiki...
