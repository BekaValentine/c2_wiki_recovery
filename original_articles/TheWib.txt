The Wib is my own implementation of the WikiWikiWeb (in perl) for my department at IBM, which provides customer support for the Component Broker product.  It's on IBM's private network.  I changed the markup language a bit - you make links by putting < and > around space-separated words, other markups are very similar to perl's pod markup language.  I have a special link type for accessing the bug database.  The parser is more complex than WikiWikiWeb's, but it is not line-based, so it supports multiple style markups on one line.  The pages are stored in RCS.
