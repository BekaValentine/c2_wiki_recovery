I named it "fat" because the original (TipiWiki) is small and simple, and my changes are not essential, only "nice to have". And I reduce the name to fWiki (it's nicer to pronounce in German language ;) )

Documentation in German language, but if you take a look at the source and the files, I think everyone with little php-knowledge can use / install it.

* http://galupki.de/php.html#fwiki overview and download
* http://galupki.de/wiki/index.php?wiki=EntwicklerDoku documentation for developers (sorry, mostly German language)
* http://galupki.de/wiki/index.php?wiki=WikiHistory the changes from TipiWiki to FatWiki and the 'main' features
