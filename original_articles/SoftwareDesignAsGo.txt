There are a number of parallels between software design and the Japanese game of go.

For example, joseki (known sequences of moves) seem similar to design patterns.
(I think this has been mentioned on another page.)
On a smaller scale, there are standard responses to situations,
such as what to do about a ladder, which correspond to idioms.
I think these are tesuji?

There's also the obsession with shape.
My contention is that a good go player knows the shape of his pieces,
and a good software designer knows the shape of his software.
(So I think SoftwareHasShape.)
Go has heaps of words for shape - dango, geta, sabaki, karui, omoi and so on.
In DesignPatterns, the patterns Bridge, ChainOfResponsibility, Facade, all have implications of shape.

More parallels? I am particularly interested in the software equivalent of ko :-).
