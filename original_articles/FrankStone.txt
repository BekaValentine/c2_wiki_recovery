''Frank, you shone brightly and then disappeared from our screens... when can we expect ARM/CL Explained --AlanFrancis''

Career soldier and proud of it. Served in Viet Nam, decorated Purple Heart, Silver Star. Come from a disciplined family of military men and women, can trace a continuous line of service back to WWI.

Began software development management after mustering out, have headed many successful large and small efforts, including commercial as well as classified applications.

If I have a single belief about software development, it is that discipline is more important than knowledge, and that knowledge of what's going on (good intelligence) is more important than anything else. My teams know me and know that I expect teamwork and initiative. Nothing less will do. I am an uncompromising son of a bitch. No excuses.

''Knowledge is more important than anything else...but discipline is more important than knowledge...logical paradox. (Your ideas sound extremely interesting, but they're very hard for a civilian to unpack from the military jargon.) --MarnenLaibowKoser, 15 Aug 2013''

The PowersThatBe in my office are tired of hearing all about ''eXtreme''Programming and KentBeck. SellingXp is a real problem. Especially all that idealist hug-each-other language. On the other hand, ArmCl may not be XP, but it sure looks light weight ... and it looks like it'll work. I'm glad that FrankStone has brought this to our attention. I'd rather be doing ArmCl than using all this high risk BigDesign that I have to use now. --AnonymousDonor

Now FrankStone is US Army, retired. But I heard that ArmCl was developed in the USSR. (or CCCP in Cyrillic) --eh

I could sell this to the top five investment banks. I can see the gleam in their eyes now.
