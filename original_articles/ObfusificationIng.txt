Tired of ReFactoring? Then stop doing it.

It's time for ObfusificationIng!

What does it mean? Who cares?!

Here's how you do it:
	* Find some code that is simple, clean, and requires no comments to understand
	* Copy and paste the code (See also CopyAndPasteProgramming)
	* Write some completely unrelated textual comment
	* Modify the code in some unobvious way so that it does almost the same thing '''most''' of the time
	* Modify the original so that it gets out of sync with the copy
	* Repeat until someone starts looking

The goal of ObfusificationIng is JobSecurity.

Here's how you do it:
	* Find some code that is simple, clean, and requires no brains to understand
	* Copy and paste the code (See also CopyAndPasteProgramming)
	* Write some completely unrelated textual '''italicized''' comment (or in ''bold'') that is parsed by a preprocessor and becomes essential to the build process
	* Modify the code in some unobvious way so that it does the same thing '''most''' of the time unless parameter three is less than 5
	* Repeat until someone starts mooing

Ahh, well-played. That was great!

I wanted to change the text and now I can't. And, since this is a page about "not refactoring", I suppose I need to just copy the text, make the change I wanted to make, and add the result here:

Here's how you '''really''' do it:
	* Find some code that is simple, clean, and requires no comments to understand
	* Copy and paste the code (See also CopyAndPasteProgramming)
	* Write some completely unrelated textual comment
	* Modify the code in some unobvious way so that it does almost the same thing '''most''' of the time
	* Modify the original so that it gets out of sync with the copy
	* Look for any tests that might be testing the code in question and apply RemoveTest.
	* Repeat until someone starts looking
