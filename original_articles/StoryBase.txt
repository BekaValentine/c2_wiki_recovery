StoryBase collects web stories like WikiWikiWeb collects patterns.  The authors offer this explanation:

We (MaryBethRosson, JackCarroll and DavidMessner) are HCI researchers at
Virginia Tech exploring World Wide Web usage. As part of our research, we are
collecting stories about WWW experiences. Almost everyone finds this new medium
exciting, though often elusive; fun, though sometimes frustrating and even frightening. 
We feel confident that YOU too have a story to tell. Maybe it's one you've already shared with friends or colleagues; maybe it's something that just happened and is fresh in your mind. Or, maybe something in the stories below will cause a reaction, or make you remember a related experience. Browse the stories we have now; when you're ready to contribute your own story, choose the link below. You can make your story private if you wish, otherwise we will share it with other visitors to the storybase.
