Very involved. In a nutshell, you could think of it as a CORBA version of EJB that can be used with any language on any platform. For complete details, check out:

Well, I would like to add a page I maintain in which I try to give an up-to-date view of the CCM:

'''Tools'''

* CCM Tools  http://ccmtools.sourceforge.net/
** The CCM Tools are a set of Java programs and libraries as well as Python scripts that supports the development of components, based on the CORBA Component Model (CCM). The CCM Tools form a component development framework that is flexible and extensible.
** In addition to the CCM specification, CCM Tools focus on topics like local components, nested component composition and contract aware components.
** On the other side, CCM Tools do not support entity components (following the idea of Light Weight CCM) and event handling.
