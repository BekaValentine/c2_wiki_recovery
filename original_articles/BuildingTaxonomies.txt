Building of Taxonomies
----
'''Considerations'''

In building a taxonomy, consideration must be made early in the process as to
what kind of format and what kind of process will be employed.

In the personal information systems context, the means and structures employed
should be limited to those available for free and public use. OpenTaxonomies

Taxonomies should contain enough detail to allow understanding of the words in
a document in relation to their domain of their use, as well as to the
individual concepts contained within.
----
'''Textual Documents'''

In any textual document, concepts are encountered which may not be easily or
widely understood. These are instances which need classification and
clarification and should be the first of concepts to be concentrated on.
