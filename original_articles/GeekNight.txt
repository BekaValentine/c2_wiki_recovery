  GeekNight has moved to
  http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/GN/Home

  Why? Well we're taking up a lot of space on C2,
  and we amount to a walled garden.

  Sysops, please leave this page, and only delete
  the others in December - Paul

It would be nice if you came back here every few months and left a note as to what you were doing. I'm thinking of something along the lines of Alistair Cook's Letters from America. -- WardCunningham

Geek night is a ThoughtWorks sponsored event held once a week in London.

We mostly work on opensource, but also give demos, talk about stuff and generally hang out w/ some really brilliant people.  We try to keep it small, but are finding that a little diversity is a great thing.  

With respect to the actual coding, it is usually done in pairs, and almost entirely in accordance with TestDrivenDevelopment (TDD).  Most of the time we will code one of the projects that the attending Thoughtworkers is active on, but occasionally we will do a project that a guest brings along.  

It is held on Wednesday nights @ 7pm at the ThoughtWorks UK office.
