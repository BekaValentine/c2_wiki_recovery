Hey! I work for Microsoft.  
I'm the lead marketing PM for the Microsoft Application Server http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/appserver/default.mspx.  My areas of interest include Windows Server, the .NET Framework and SDK, Visual Studio, and related pieces. 

I previously worked with IBM for about 4 years in a similar capacity, focusing on DCE, Encina, MqSeries, Publish and Subscribe technology, CORBA, and finally, WebSphere and VisualAge. I arrived at IBM by way of Transarc, a software startup that was acquired by IBM in 1994.  

I joined Microsoft after being convinced that most software was too hard and too expensive, and there ought to be a simpler, easier way.  I'm continuously looking for that way.  XML Web Services is a step forward.  So is managed code.

Hi Dino. I agree with you MS software has mass appeal, partly due to pricing. Killed a few competitors along the way though. Do you see security / interoperability / bandwidth concerns going to derail SoapProtocol based WebServices? 
* I am hoping you can change (or provide useful material to revive)  EjbsAndDistributedTransaction, since you expressed interest in refactoring WhatsWrongWithEjb in Dec04. I could act as intermediary and hope to get some opposition views as well.
* Also I rather like you to start improving /criticising / explaining a range of MS based offerings, and offer opinion on competitive alternatives too. I have created/maintained a sizable number of C2 pages since 2004
