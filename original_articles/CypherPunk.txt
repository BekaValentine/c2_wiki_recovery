Hackers deriving social background from CyberPunk, technical approach from FreeSoftware, and attitude from CryptoAnarchism. (more description please)    JohnGilmore is a notable example.  Of course there are many personal opinions within this very vaguely defined group.  At one time this all happened on a list at toad.com, but it suffers badly from noise.

The motto: ``cypherpunks write code'' is a way of keeping away from the pretension and daydreaming that plagues people who only talk about CryptoAnarchism.

One important document is the CypherPunkManifesto.
