Hello WikiZens.  I am Kachina, a student at a community college and I am fascinated by Wiki.  I want very much to participate - I know that this will be considered an orphan page, but if any passing WikiGnome s would just give me a moment to get my bearings... I want to understand Wiki but I have a feeling that that will ''never'' happen in my lifetime.  If you can be patient with me, I will be the best WikiZen I can be.

''Welcome, Kachina!  It is all pretty simple really.  Take a look, if you haven't already, at: WelcomeVisitors, StartingPoints, TipsForBeginners to get you started.''
