A purely functional programming language invented by Mark P. Jones (homepage: http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/). It was meant to be an introductory language to FunctionalProgramming. This was an early (1994) implementation of HaskellLanguage specification 1.2. Not developed anymore. The latest version can be obtained from http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/goferarc/index.html.

It has support for lists, anonymous functions, HigherOrderFunctions, PatternMatching and LazyEvaluation.

"Functional programming" (http://www.cs.uu.nl/people/jeroen/courses/fp-eng.pdf) is a nice book on functional programming and uses Gofer.

Personally I found SchemeLanguage easier to learn thanks to the syntax, or rather, the lack of. -- PeterBarabas
