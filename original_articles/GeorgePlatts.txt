George is an art therapist who earlier in his career became expert at running sessions of non-competitive games.

When BruceAnderson was looking for a games person for the ThornwoodWorkshop, George was recommended, came, and did a great job.  He has also been part of the team at the second PLoP (PLoP95) and at the first EuroPLoP (EuroPLoP96?).

Games are useful in a workshop as they can be used to change the energy and engage different parts of the intelligence.
