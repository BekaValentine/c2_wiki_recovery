''I see TheMeaningOfLife is the continuous exploration of MeaningOfLife''

* In math it is called closure? 

Seriously, my current HigherPrinciples topic is WhatIsIntegrity and WhatsInItForMe

I will be putting a few related questions here, and if there are interests and meaningful participation, then maybe we can look at starting a new page

'''''WhatIsIntegrity'''''

I looked up dictionary, it says something about honesty, a touchy subject. On the web there is not much information on that, but a few do come up and can be used for bedtime reading

Questions:
* do most people in the same culture have similar viewpoints about what it is, what it means, and its relevance to our lives?
* do Americans understand the same way as Europeans? How about Asians?
* how much integrity is needed in a person, a society, ...
* integrity: reputation vs image 
* granularity: personal, organization, etc
