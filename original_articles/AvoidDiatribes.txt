Begin Monologue
* Much space and time is consumed when two or more individuals involve themselves in point-making that leads to no conclusions, instead leads to conflicts and misunderstandings regarding a topic, method, or structure.
* It is a GoodThing to avoid involvement in such endless debates, usually typified by creating a very long page, and when it becomes lengthy, to continue the thread by creating part1, part2, etc.
* '''Seldom''', no, '''never''' gnome such pages, for they are not meant to be improved upon, and you may encounter opposition and be drawn into the inconclusive work.
** You may find if you do, that one or more of those who have been interested or involved it the work will attempt to drag you into another such conversation. 
* They usually cannot be fixed simply or improved upon somewhat by editing, the strategy seeming to be to make points and counter-points via another paragraph, ask another question, oppose via responses not gendering understanding or resolution.  
* The way you may identify such pages: 
** they will have multiple and continuing appearances on RecentChanges for days, weeks and months at a time. 
** they are also hard to follow and to not resolve to points being resolved.
* so avoid reading, commenting within, or about such pages.
End Monologue

To avoid this becoming anything other than a monologue, simply delete this page if you disagree and it will all be over, I will not restore it.

Long heated debates are often a symptom of miscommunication or different fundamental understandings of something, not a cause. The real goal should be to get to the bottom of such differences in views rather than sweep them under the rug like a communist nation that wants to hide conflict in order to look orderly and pretty.
