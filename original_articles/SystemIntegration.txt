In SystemsDevelopment projects, often SystemIntegration can be a bigger task than programming.

And in recent climate where a lot of IT decisions favor ApplicationServiceProvider, OutSourcing, use of EnterpriseResourcePlanningSoftware, etc, SystemIntegration can become the most complex task. Programming duties can sometimes become a nonevent.

And perhaps the shift towards more SystemIntegration instead of SystemsArchitecting, is the driving force behind the recent attention given to InformationTechnologyServiceManagement type initiatives.
