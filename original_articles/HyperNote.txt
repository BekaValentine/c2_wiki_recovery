
Over on OoEnvironmentForPalm, DavidMcNicol talked about his WikiClone for the PalmPilot:

	 :	I've developed a simple version of Wiki for the Palm, and I plan to add support for annotated diagrams, outline lists, OMT diagrams. Actually, the plan is to have a simple API to allow anybody to add new functionality. I see no reason why a system like this could not be hooked into the OO environment. Ward's HyperPerl springs to mind, though I am perhaps becoming a tad too adventurous.

HyperNote is very Wiki-like, but it unfortunately suffers from one serious fault - your text can't take up more than one page. There are also reports of crashes (BlakeWinton reports that it crashed his Palm V with an "Object not in form" error). However, it could very easily be picked up by interested parties, given that it is licensed under the GnuGeneralPublicLicense.

I picked up HyperNote and make it work on PalmOS 5 devices - Gaku (07/12/2003)

	* Just bought Palm OS5 device and this works well. 
	* A find function would be great.
	* Is there a way to import and export from other wikis?

'''Defects'''
On the Palm Zire 71 (Palm OS 5), when I try to use "Preferences" or "About," I get the following error: Emul68kCommon.c Line: 1594, Index out of range. This causes my handheld to soft reboot, so it is only nuisance. -- BenWilson (2004-07-18)
