I have been test-driving free ZuluPad for a couple of weeks now, and I am totally impressed.  It is what I have wanted for many years, a simple NotePad that has the ability to create WikiPage type links to new pages and also supports WebLinks.  My only complaint is that the free version does not support local links i.e.: file:///, like MetaPad does.
* I still think that this is the best PersonalWiki that I have used to date [10-17-2009].
