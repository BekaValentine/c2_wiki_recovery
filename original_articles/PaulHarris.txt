I'm a one-man software engineer, working on long term contract-based software development projects with small entrepreneurs or researchers.

I have a deep interest in finding better ways of doing my job, mostly by finding better ways of writing C++ code and managing ad-hoc/agile projects that can keep up with a continuous innovation process.  I'm currently using generic techniques and finding them vastly cleaner and more efficient than the older OO techniques.

This wiki has vastly expanded my knowledge on all things, and I don't feel like I deserve my own page, but here it is anyway.
