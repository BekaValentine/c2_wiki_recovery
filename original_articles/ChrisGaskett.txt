Hi,

I'm a lecturer at James Cook University in Cairns Australia. I used to work mainly on robotics, vision, and learning systems but now I'm working on disease modelling and speech recognition.

I run wikis for staff and students at the School of IT at JCU using the MoinMoin WikiEngine.

My homepage is at http://mirriwinni.it.jcu.edu.au/~cgaskett/
(I'm using MoinMoin to deliver my homepage too... perhaps I am a victim of the HammerTruism.)
