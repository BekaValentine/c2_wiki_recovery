Watch the directors cut, if you can! (Otherwise, please at least ignore the end).
''That's all I've ever seen, you can't find the original release anymore.''
'''The original release (the 1982 US theatrical release, that is) is now (2008) included among the 4- and 5-disk editions of the Final Cut DVD set.'''

Based (''loosely'') on the PhilDick book, DoAndroidsDreamOfElectricSheep.

Hmmm, this is a hard question. It depends whether you 
	* Read the book
	* Watch the directors cut
	* Watch the version which was originally in the movie theatres.
		* Actually there were at least 2 versions in the original theatrical release. The American release was about 30 minutes shorter than the European release. Read the FAQ. 
	* Watch the forthcoming Blade Runner Special Edition DVD: http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Special_Edition.htm.
However, I added my opinion... :-)

''My theory: Rick isn't but Gaff is. Gaff is a replicant made with Deckard's memories - hence the unicorn. Gaff acts pretty demented and ends up crippled - I guess Rick's memories didn't serve him well. I'm guessing he didn't suppress them adequately with alcohol.''
