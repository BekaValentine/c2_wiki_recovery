If you like JorgeLuisBorges, you may like ItaloCalvino.  His short story "The Distance of the Moon" is wonderful.

Both authors - great, also GabrielGarciaMarquez. Calvino's book of Italian Folk tales is wonderful - I used to read it to my kids and they loved it. Beats the pants off Hans Christian... -- DaveEveritt

Borges was obsessed by representation of real things in words. In a sense, this is normal that author pleases the IT people's mind because programming and writing can generate similar ThinkingPattern''''''s. All that is about representing things or in words or in code. The only thing is that when you represent things in words, it is so close to the ways the mind thinks that it can become easily esoteric! -- OlivierRey
