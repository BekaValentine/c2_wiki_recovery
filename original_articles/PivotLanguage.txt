A PivotLanguage is a language used as an intermediary representation between translation between many languages. It allows for translators to only need to understand the pivot language, and the language their translating, rather than having to understand all possible combinations of languages. The main disadvantage is that a PivotLanguage may not be able to sufficiently represent the constructs in all languages being translated, leading to inaccuracies in translation.

In the scope of computing the PivotLanguage often takes the form of a ByteCode or IntermediateLanguage.
