I just created the category tag ComputerArchitecture. Is there a better wiki for discussing the nuts and bolts of designing CPUs and computers? Discussing ComputerArchitecture on C2 seems to be a little off-topic, like discussing hardwood and felt pads would be a little off-topic on a wiki focused on playing the piano. -- DavidCary
