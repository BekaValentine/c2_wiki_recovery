I highly recommend his (co-authored) paper on cities as information processing systems: http://applied.math.utsa.edu/~salingar/InfoCities.html.

He also wrote "Anti-Architecture and Deconstruction" (ISBN 3-937954-01-5; UMBAU-VERLAG, 2004).

Fascinating discussion of information processing role of cities, which draws on both ChristopherAlexander and HerbertSimon's organization theory.
