''What does "Add Children" do? And can we use HTML on any page?''

	1 SmallWiki is not flat as other wikis, you have the possibility to nest pages into folders to group them. This is mainly a feature for administrators to keep everything in shape; casual users probably won't notice this.
	1 Of course, one might put any kind of HTML into a page, but don't blame me if the output isn't valid XHTML anymore.
