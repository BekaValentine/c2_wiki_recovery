ScientificLinux is a free distribution based on the same code as RedHatEnterpriseLinux.

See https://www.scientificlinux.org/ (HttpsLinksDontWorkOnWiki)
*In this case, use: http://www.scientificlinux.org (It automatically redirects to https, but maybe only with InternetExplorer?) (also with MozillaFirefox)

What's the point of this being a secure site, anyway?  Especially when you have to accept an untrusted certificate to get in?
