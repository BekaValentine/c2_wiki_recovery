A DeveloperStory is similar to a UserStory, but is written by a developer to describe a FeatureLet.

In others' ;) words, a DeveloperStory is a story about an increment of work done toward the completion of a feature (called a FeatureLet).  Each DeveloperStory is written on a card, and describes a chunk of partial functionality that is valuable to a tester.

This would only be relevant in an process bridge (See AgileBridge).

Q: Is there a UserStory that drives this feature?

Response:  In our trials, we did not have UserStories.  A prototype system was used in place of Requirements.  A UserStory could make a good DeveloperStory if the functionality it described were completed at the time of integration and that were all that had to be tested.

Q: Does a DeveloperStory add benefit the FeatureLet does not?  Why would I want to read a story when I can read code?

Response: A DeveloperStory is the description.  The FeatureLet is the thing described.  I did not want to call it a feature because it is really "a part of a feature that I did not implement in full, so one should expect errors when you do this and this."

Still valuable for testing when using GUI automation tools.  For example, I could write a script to go and click a button..  Later, I'd tie this script into a routine to verify the dialog box that came up.
