3o Group has developed 3oProgramming. An initiative to help OpenSource developers to manage their projects. More information can be found on http://www.3o.nl

3oProgramming is based on eXtremeProgramming but has some differences. E.g. 3oProgramming does not deal with customers, simply because they do not exist in most OpenSource projects.

Instead of a customer there's a community which containes mostly software developers responsible for joining in projects as a developer or as a tester. The people within the community are situated worldwide, as with the developers joining a project. This geograhical distance can influence the progress of the project over time in a negative way.. 

Looking at this scenario 3o Group tried to come up with a non commercial development method where the priority lies at implementing standards for designing, coding and planning. 

Please feel welcome to give critisism about the concept.
