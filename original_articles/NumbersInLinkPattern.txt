ThisWiki started out talking primarily about patterns.

Its best invention seems to be the deletion of SpacesBetweenWords in order to make the name of a pattern TurnBlue.  

AnotherPattern syntactically which can evoke PatternRecognition is TheAcronym and SomethingWithDigits -- Examples include: IMHO, OOPSLA, Oopsla1998, Iteration4, Plan9, Mustang1968 or 70Firebird, ClassOf1972, Election2004, and Year2000.

Several other wikis have modified the LinkPattern to add digits. I wonder what would happen if ThisWiki expanded the LinkPattern for a trial moment.
