What is an ideal DevelopmentServer for a team?

We'll assume LinuxOs. ''You don't have to assume, all the good tools are open source and have Windows versions. . . some versions of windows are even "stable"''

What services will we want?

	* CVS - ConcurrentVersionsSystem - 
configured to write change logs to a newsgroup, so we'll need a
	* NNTP (News) Server
	* Web server - for documentation and stuff, and of course, a 
	* WikiWiki - which clone would be most appropriate?
	* Mail and mail list services - doesn't seem as critical with news and the wiki
	* BugTrackingSoftware - something BugZilla-ish; maybe even public.
	* Cross referencing tools - like LXR
	* Automated Build and testing services
	* ssh or telnet service, and ftp
	* All the tools necessary for all the above (gcc, perl, python, etc.)
	* Virtual Private Network or equivalent?
some way to 'get in from outside' without clear-texting too much data.
(maybe just commercial-culture paranoia)
Is there an easy, cheap way to set up a Linux Tunnel (VPN?)
	* Anything else come to mind?
	
How good is the SourceForge environment?  
Is it a good template, or not?
How about the http://www.mozilla.org environment?
	
Any comments, suggestions, or experiences to share?

I agree with this. I used CVS, Insecticida (task tracking), and BVT (automated build which I hope to release to the public in the future). JUnit was used to create the tests and make was used to compile, instead of ant which now I realize is much better. The project was really going fast and under control. The only "problem" was that passing the tests was increasingly harder as the project grew, of course because we could not introduce all those subtle bugs that plague most software projects.

One of the key areas was that whenever you made a checkin, you were notified by BVT if the check-in was not successful. You had a limited amount of time to fix the build or remove the check-in, but at the end of the day the build must pass. We never stayed late, because it is better to MakeItCompileTheFirstTime rather than CheckInAndFixLater.

Also used XoopsForge (SourceForge clone) and it was way too heavy and lacked the automated build feature.

Funny that I see no mention of backups. . . 

''Maybe they are too obvious or they are non obvious at all. I vote for the first one.''

With my primary client, we ended up with something like this:

linux box (running debian something, though it doesn't really matter)

cvs and home grown cvs checkin tools for posting to a mailing list (no 
NNTP or news based stuff).  apache for the web site.  MoinMoin for the 
wiki.  One of the wiki pages is the cvs mailing list.  

viewcvs is installed, with the query stuff and the syntax coloring stuff.
there's a button on the web page that runs a build of the product
based on an optional cvs revision tag.

ssh is the only tunnel - i just point my local cvs (2401) and web ports
at the server through ssh, and i'm all set to go.

Not terribly exciting or comprehensive, but it works.  The automated
build process could be improved, the test suite could be improved,
and it would be nice to have some kind of bug tracking thing.
(I've looked at roundup - that seems likely).

For backups, the linux box is configured to mirror the /usr partition
nightly.  Periodically I pull a tarball of the repository.
(I'm in a different state, so that gives an offsite backup).

The project isn't too large; so far this has been enough.

Have to admit, but am very happy with Linux+MySQL+Subversion+Trac with Eclipse/Subclips.  
Trac (http://trac.edgewall.org/) has come a long way, and provides a very useful UI.
Even end users can report and track bugs.
