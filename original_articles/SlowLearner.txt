When I was very young, the school system informed my parents that I was a "slow learner." As I grew older, they said just the opposite. I really wasn't doing anything different, so which categorization was more correct?

Surprise, surprise, they were dead wrong both times. No, in fact it's obvious that I'm a ''non''-learner. I can prove this. How many opportunities have I had today for learning. Dozens? Hundreds? Now multiply that by the number of days that I've been alive. And how many experiences have I actually ''learned'' from? You see my point.

But wouldn't it be great if I ''could'' be a slow learner. If all of my experiences gradually improved my awareness and my character. If listening to someone's beliefs was never a waste of time. If I viewed learning as a process rather than a goal. If I always sought perfection but could be pleased with mere progress.

If I could be a SlowLearner, that would also imply that I:
	* Remember the things I've learned and integrate them into my actions
	* Have patience to devote the time necessary to really learn a subject
	* Seek out the experts on a subject and absorb everything I can from them
	* Find value in many different sources 
	* Am not afraid of being called slow, freeing me to learn subjects that don't fall within my natural talents
	* Accept advice graciously
	* Take time to understand another viewpoint whether or not I agree with it
	* Am better able to help others learn; I'd be more aware of the steps of the learning process


Of course, there's such a thing as being too slow. Look how many years it took me to realize that I want to try to be a SlowLearner. Hey, I might ''be'' one by now if I'd realized this sooner! Oh wait, it's not about being, it's about becoming, isn't it :)

Or could it be about being, and becoming is describing an expectation?

Cool! I had no idea. Upon investigation of this book, one quote from the Introduction struck me in particular: 
	 :	"Do not underestimate the shallowness of my understanding."

There is also value in forgetting.
