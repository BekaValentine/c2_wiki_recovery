Yes, I'm still here, though not as often as I would like.

I am a member of the ''Association Of C and C++ Users'' (ACCU). I can't form a suitable WikiName from the acronym, so I'll use AssocCandCppUsers instead.

I used to be a contract software engineer operating in the UK, specializing in whatever my clients wanted me to 8). After about 12 years of this, I finally gave in to one of the frequent offers to "go permie". The net result was a year commuting to the USA and finally moving there in 2000. Since then, I've sadly not really had any spare time for newsgroups or Wiki.

I am finally getting back into the circles of conferences etc. after 3 years and am attending OOPSLA 2003 next month. I especially looking forward to the Workshop on Re-use in Constrained Environments.

I can be reached by email at Keith dot Derrick at Plantronics dot com.

As for VbWiki, I'll see if I can find it - though I have no web space to post it. I suspect there are much better implementations around nowadays.

''Jan2004 request from DavidLiu. I am interested in your VbWiki. If you can make it freely available, please let me know. Thanks''
