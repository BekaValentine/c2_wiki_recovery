You want to learn to do a task by collecting practices that have worked in the past.

No one has done the task before.

One can paraphrase the InventorsParadox to say that it is sometimes easier to learn how to solve a particular problem by first learning how to solve the next more general problem, and then specializing the more general solution.

''Therefore''

Start collecting practices that have worked for the next more general task.  Slowly refocus the collection of practices to the specific task as experience grows.
