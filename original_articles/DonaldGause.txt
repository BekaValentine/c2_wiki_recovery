A terrific professor who taught me a lot about hueristic problem solving and life way back in 1985. He taught at the (then) State University of New York at Binghamton, now Binghamton University. I think he still teaches there. Members of my class climed Slide Mountain - do you know where that is and why it is important? Also, do you know anything about the final problem?
