I'm looking for recommendations.  A friend's child
has been slow at learning to read, and now they're
in a Catch-22 situation.  Anything at the right
reading level is too childish, but anything that's
sufficiently exciting and engaging is too advanced.

Please, suggestions welcome for books and stories
in which the language is simple, but the stories
aren't too childish.

Thanks.

''How about the Limony Snickett (sp?) series? Also NeilGaiman's Coraline. I also recommend The Railway Children.''

''I bet you'd also get some great ideas from the BookShelved wiki.''

IsaacAsimov, or the Willard Price "Adventure" series.

Any others?
