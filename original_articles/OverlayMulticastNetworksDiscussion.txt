A page which had the long name:
  I''''''ssuesInOverlayMulticastNetworksDynamicRoutingAndCommunicationCost

Was refactored as follows:
* A TopicalPage called OverlayMulticastNetworks was created
* WantedPages with the following names were referenced as ForwardLinks
** DynamicRouting
** CommunicationCost

This was done to reduce the burden of creating a long pages with long names which end up being a BigBallOfMud, and from becoming a WalledGarden, since instead of dealing with pages tied to specifics only a few people may understand or appreciate, pages are created which will integrate ideas, thoughts, and overall concepts which apply to many other pages.

This avoids the temptation to create what already exists all over again. What readers and writers on this wiki want is a page they can relate to. If a person has expertise and can write well about experiences and issues which have been encountered, and are likely to be encountered by others, PositiveDialogue may then ensue.
