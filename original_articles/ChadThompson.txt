I'm a software developer based in Central Iowa.  You can find out more about me here:

Or take a look at my personal page:  http://chadthompson.me

I've been working mostly with Oracle technologies as a consultant lately - Oracle ADF, Java development, etc.  I realized after sending a link to the PPR that my page here was at least seven years out of date.  So it goes.
