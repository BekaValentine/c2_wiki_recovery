''TomMunnecke's WalledGarden: AutocatalyticSpace, BeneGnosis, MalGnosis (2003-03-13)''

MalGnosis is a way of knowing based on what is wrong. This is compared to BeneGnosis.  This often fuels a ProblemAddictionLoop.  For example, consider a organization trying to stop pink elephant thinking.  You can't manage what you can measure, they might think, so they do a survey of how many people are thinking about pink elephants.  They then do a trend analysis, and discover that the second survey indicates a marked increase in the number of people thinking about pink elephants....etc.

contrast to BeneGnosis

Perhaps these two can be interdependent.
