A donut most notable for the assembly line that produces circle after circle of glazed snack.

Specially known for their very light donuts -- according to expert sources the secret ingredient is potato flour.

Very common in the south, though some have appeared to pop up in NYC lately.
''They've got as far as Montreal now... and Sydney!''

Park in the lot and wait for the sign to light up! 

''Also available as a surgical procedure. They stick a tube up a vein in your arm and pump raw KrispyKreme thru it. This coats the inside linings of your arteries - including the coronary arteries - directly without making you taste the f5s first. --PhlIp''

The Kreme has invaded the pacific northwest. Indulging my son, I waited with a few hundred other folks to try these donuts on opening weekend. The line wound through the parking lot, around the building, and through a circus tent style gift shop before entering the store. We bought two dozen, one of which was to impress the folks we were meeting that afternoon. I also picked up a KrispyKreme logo aluminum coffee mug. It doesn't keep my coffee that hot, but it does accrue respectful nods. Such is the brand's psychokinetic power.

I may be alone here, but I hate their so-called "donuts" - more like foamed plastic drenched in granulated sugar.  Dunkin' Donuts is much better, and Tim Horton's is better still. -- MikeSmith

If a Krispy Kreme is the worst, what is the best?

* Donuts made fresh at a cider mill -- still warm, with hot cider.  (It's a tradition in Michigan in the fall).
