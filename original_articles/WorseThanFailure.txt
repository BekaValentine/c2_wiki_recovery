WorseThanFailure (or '''WTF?!''') is a website that features bad code, bad experiences, and "curious perversions in information technology"... more to amuse the audience than to provide any sort of education. 

You can find it here:  http://worsethanfailure.com/

Its name used to be "TheDailyWtf" and WTF didn't use to mean WorseThanFailure... It changed recently... I think that the original name was far more funny...

It very quickly changed back to http://thedailywtf.com/
