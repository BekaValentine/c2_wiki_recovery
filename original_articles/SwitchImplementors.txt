Pairing would provide the most feedback, CollectiveCodeOwnership, and lowest TruckNumber.  However, you're unable to pair (for whatever reason).  If you have willing coworkers, consider the SwitchImplementors technique:

You get half way through the implementation of some feature, and Bob, your coworker, gets half way through his.  Now, switch, and finish implementing each others' features.  Talk about what you see in each other's code.
