The Agile Experience Group of the Twin Cities, Minnesota, meets and collaborates to share experiences, suggestions, and ideas about moving software development efforts towards more agile, more lightweight practices.	Extreme Programming (XP), SCRUM, Crystal, FDD, and ASD are agile approaches. See www.agilealliance.com for more information.

This group is open to anyone with an interest in Agile approaches, regardless of experience, location, or intent to attend a meeting. Meetings are free.

Our website is: Agile_Experience_Group@yahoogroups.com

We meet monthly the Twin Cities, Minnesota area and are a special interest group (SIG) of the ObjectTechnologyUserGroup. 

Most meetings are sponsored by Advanced Technologies Integration, Inc., www.atico.com, who provides meeting space, administrative support, pizza, and drinks for meetings, which are held in Edina at France and 494. Directions are included in every meeting announcement. The first AEG meeting was December of 2001.

The agenda is usually:

	* 6:30 Welcome and introductions
	* 6:45 Main topic
	* 8:30 End of formal meeting
	* 8:30 About half of us wander across the street to Fudruckers for continued discussions over beers or shakes

Topics have included:

	* Customer interaction
	* Scrum discussion
	* Scrum extreme hour exercise
	* Test-first development demonstration and experiment
	* Conference overviews
	* Refactoring persistence frameworks
	* Open Space night
	* Bob Martin (speaker)

We sometimes put on events with our parent organization, the ObjectTechnologyUserGroup, and occasionally with TwinSPIN, http://www.glewwe-castle.com/twinspin.
