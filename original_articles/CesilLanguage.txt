Opposite end of the spectrum from CecilLanguage.

'''CESIL: Computer Education In Schools Instruction Language''' is (or was) one of the most misguided attempts at making programming easier to learn ever.  The guiding principle was dumb-it-down.  If I remember right CESIL had 15 brain dead op codes, and two addressing modes, (constant and variable).  It didn't correspond to a real AssemblyLanguage, so you wouldn't do anything ''dangerous'' with it like read or write to files by accessing I/O hardware directly.  Nor did it have any of those ''difficult'' HighLevelLanguage constructs.  You ended up with something worse than the worst of both worlds.  Oh, and it was all done off line in batch mode.  ''I hope it's not still in use somewhere''. You can try out CESIL with a CESIL IDE here: http://www.obelisk.demon.co.uk/cesil/

I actually learned assembler programming in school using CESIL. I didn't think anybody else outside of my class had even heard of it! As for not suitable for the real world, I'd have to disagree and say that it set me up fantastically to master my Commodore PR100 programmable calculator, which I still have nearly 25 years later!

As for batch mode, we did have a Research Machines 280Z computer but AFAICR we actually ran the CESIL programs using a cardboard CPU and bits of paper etc to simulate the PC. At the time it felt like cutting edge, aged 12!
