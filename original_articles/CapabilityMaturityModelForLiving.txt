A high level according to the CapabilityMaturityModel may be good for an industrial company.

But a comment on CapabilityMaturityModel made me think about it in a more general sense:
What about your individual life? Is the CapabilityMaturityModel useful in measuring your own life?

Is a high level an indicator of mental balance? Does it help happyness?
Should one strive for it?

I can tell you, that I consider myself quite balanced, but do not have a very high level.
But my wife manages her life and houshold on level 5 (has done planning and improving plans since school)!
Though she did so to cope with problems in family and to forcefully regain stability in an unstable life.
