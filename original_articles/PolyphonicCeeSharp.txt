"Polyphonic C# extends the C# programming language with new asynchronous concurrency abstractions, based on the JoinCalculus. The language presents a simple and powerful model of concurrency which is applicable both to multithreaded applications running on a single machine and to the orchestration of asynchronous, event-based applications communicating over a wide area network."
