Note: This page has moved to MicrosoftManagedCode. Managed''''''Services actually refer to an entirely different subject and pertains to matters like Offsite hosting, etc. Apologies to people who I have managed to confuse. 
A further note is at the end of page

Question: Any characteristic of  Managed code beside the implications of requiring the use of CommonLanguageRuntime?

Question: Is it possible to have a service which is not managed?

Question: What the heck do they mean by service anyway?

'''An Industry infested with mix and match Jargon?'''

''Managed Services from Microsoft'' is also found in use by trade press at times. In http://www.zdnet.co.uk/print/?TYPE=story&AT=39143730-39020387t-10000006c ZDNet UK reporter said DonBox was using that term to refer to the "service oriented" nature of MicrosoftIndigo technology. 

Still it will be less confusing today to refer to ''Managed Code'' instead of ''Managed Services''.
