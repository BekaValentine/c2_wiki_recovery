LocomotiveBasic - variant of BASIC employed on the AmstradCpc. Implemented in an extremely short amount of time after the machine's design was switched from the 6502 to the Z80. Very extended basic including many graphics primitive. It suffered from being a little too slow for most commercial applications.
