Press the title to see all pages of this category.

Indexes are lists of wiki (or external?) links. Each index usually has some topic or theme grouping the links it contains.

Pages in this category may have material other than indexes, but they contain at least one index related to the page title (which list browsers may find using this page's title search above).

Categories are not in the Index category. Nor are RoadMaps usually.
