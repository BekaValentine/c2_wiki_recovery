The secret police of the novel ''NineteenEightyFour'' (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_police).

I haven't given much thought to NineteenEightyFour or the ThoughtPolice for some time, until, recently, I noticed that the new iMacs have a built in camera that they call "iSight". Remarkably reminiscent of the TV w/built-in camera of 1984 fame that can't be turned off. Worrisome? ''Maybe''. Certainly something to think about. Now if only I could remember who is at war with whom... ;-) -- RonJandrasi
