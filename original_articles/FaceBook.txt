http://thesocialskinny.com/216-social-media-and-internet-statistics-september-2012/ says Twitter claims to have something like 150 million monthly users and 400 million tweets per day. At first that sounds impressive. But compared with FaceBook it's pathetic. Here's why.

On Twitter http://www.twopblog.com/2012/01/some-statistics-on-new-twitter-accounts.html says only 10% of Twitter's claimed users do anything but sit and listen passively.

Now there are 3.2 billion likes and comments on Facebook per day. That sounds like only 8 times more than Twitter but then you have to consider the topology of subscription. I mean subscription in the sense of pub/sub.

Fully 50% of Facebook users have more than 100 friends. Where under 10% of twitterers follow that many people (http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-how-many-users-does-twitter-really-have-2011-3). 

50% of 1,000,000,000 = 500 million.

10% of 150,000,000 = 15 million.

500/15 = a total of 33 times as many brains for each Facebook comment and like to flow through.

8 times as many messages. So 33 x 8 times as many user interactions.

Which means Facebook has over 260 times more tweet equivalents per day than Twitter. 

So Twitter is still influential because it has celebrities and breaking news. But almost no one lives there. If you do, you live in a backwater. If you live in G+ you live in a backwater of a backwater. If you live in C2 ... well, you're a WikiGhost.

FaceBook assigns us numbers, and numbers to all our friends, but it still feels like a big WalledGarden that invites us to to do more gardening or masonry for them.  ... And don't forget to looked at LinkedIn as well.
