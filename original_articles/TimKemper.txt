Senior Java Developer with Valencia Systems, Inc. 

I've been programming in Java full time since late 1996. 

I became interested in starting a Design Patterns study group following a seminar by AlanShalloway, in November of 2001. In this seminar, Shalloway elucidated some of the CommonCharacteristicsOfDesignPatterns, that incidentally are characteristics of good OO design principles. Thus, I was motivated to begin a renewed study of software design patterns with an emphasis on the common OO techniques used in an attempt to gain a deeper and more fundamental understanding of patterns studied. 

I also felt that verbal discussion of these basic principles, and the patterns in general, would lead to a greater ownership of the material as well as a validation of how much I understand these topics.
