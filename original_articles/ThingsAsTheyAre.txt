''Lâ€™ Envoi'' by RudyardKipling

 When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,
 When the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died,
 We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an aeon or two,
 Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew!

 And those that were good shall be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;
 They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair;
 They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;
 They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!

 And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;
 And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,
 But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,
 Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of ThingsAsTheyAre!

From ''The Holy War'' by RudyardKipling

 ...

 All enemy divisions,
 Recruits of every class,
 And highly-screened positions
 For flame or poison-gas;
 The craft that we call modern,
 The crimes that we call new,
 John Bunyan had 'em typed and filed
 In sixteen Eighty-two.

 Likewise the Lords of Looseness
 That hamper faith and works,
 The Perseverance-Doubters,
 And Present-Comfort shirks,
 With brittle intellectuals
 Who crack beneath a strain --
 John Bunyan met that helpful set
 In Charles the Second's reign.
