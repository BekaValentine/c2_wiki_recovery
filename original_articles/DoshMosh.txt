I've been wanting to create this page for many years! 

DoshMosh is a startup that is attempting to make democracy into a global economic force. Its philosophy is that money and votes are both horribly broken information systems - but that by bolting the two together we can heal them. That is to say, make human preference a basis for economics and break the lock the ultra-rich have on buying votes - by letting everyone buy them!

DoshMosh is also the realisation of the idea that began with WikiStoneSociety. But it's got a lot more than that:

	* It's SubjectOriented. That's to say it distinguishes subjects from contexts. Subjects are denoted with a $ prefix, contexts are denoted by #tags. Each user expression - called opinions - links a $subject to a bunch of #contexts.
	* $Subjects compete in all their #contexts. Which means that, for the first time, you can actually win an argument online ...
	* It's structured by a SemiLattice of HashTag'''''''s. This means that a vote for an opinion, say "$Kara is the #creepiest #cinema #ai" affects $Kara in (#creepiest) and (#creepiest #cinema) and (#creepiest #ai) and (#cinema #ai) and ... the closure of the context.
	* It rewards popular opinions and punishes unpopular ones - financially. And that means there's now a way to financially punish trolling and encourage collaboration.
	* It's basically a way to turn all of facebook into a wiki - but no NPOV is required!
	* It's also a VideoWiki. I mean that's core to its user experience.

And much more. I've been devoting most of my spare time to this project for years. I'm so happy to be at the pointy end of it now and I'd love you to come and play. We're in private alpha for the next couple of weeks and will then attempt a public alpha (scary!). Check out the rough video at http://www.doshmosh.com for an idea about the UX and email pete @ doshmosh.com if you'd like to take part in the private alpha. -- PeterMerel.
