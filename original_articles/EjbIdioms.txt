'''UrbanCode EjbBenchmark'''
The design idioms covered by the benchmark are:
	* FineGrainedEntityBean (FGE)-often used by beginners to EnterpriseJavaBeans 
	* CoarseGrainedEntityBean (CGE)-the best performing Entity Bean idiom typically used in practice 
	* CoarseGrainedContainerManagedEntityBean (CGCME)- touted as faster then Bean Managed Persistent Entity Beans 
	* OptimizedEntityBean (OE)- the best performing contender that still uses Entity Beans 
	* SessionoverEntityBean (SE)-typically advanced as a "best practice" in trade media 
	* CoarseGrainedSessionBeans (CGS)-the proposed best performer

There is a chapter on idioms in EjbDesignPatternsBook.

Please add any that you think of, and feel free to refactor the groupings.
