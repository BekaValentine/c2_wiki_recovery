Describe MartijnFaassen here.

He's a Zopista of much standing, and sitting. and coding. (ShaeErisson wrote)

And now I should write some things myself. I do Zope for a living; see
http://www.zope.org/Members/faassen for more on that.

I like the PythonLanguage a lot. I gaze with interest at many other interesting
languages, but can't really say that I'm fluent in many of them. I do know CLanguage and used to use CeePlusPlus before I discovered Python. 
I've also used the DelphiLanguage.

I'm also a big fan of the EtcLanguage. Well, perhaps not. :)

Some other random tidbits: I'm an INTP most of the time, sometimes an ENTP. Agnostic with discordian tendencies.
