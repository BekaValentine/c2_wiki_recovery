ChristopherAlexander describes GenerativeProcesses in NatureOfOrder. These are processes where the design emerges from the process rather than being constructed (typically on a drawing board) at the beginning. He contrasts GenerativeProcesses with ConstructiveProcesses. Our current culture reflects a strong bias towards ConstructiveProcesses, especially in the architecture (as in buildings) and SoftwareDevelopment.
