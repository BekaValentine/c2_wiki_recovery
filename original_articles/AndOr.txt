English needs AndOr  ''Isn't it already there?  I often see "this and/or that" in writing.''

Pronounced Andor

It stands for the boolean 'or'.

English has 'and', and 'or'. But it does not yet have an 'andor'. In English, the language has 'and' which classifies as a boolean and. English also has 'or' which classifies as a boolean 'exclusive-or'. What English word should stand for boolean 'or'? What English word should stand for boolean 'exclusive-or'?

That is the concept behind AndOr or its cousin, OrAnd. Whatever sounds better, eh?

One thing or another. Comprised of one but not both of the set {one thing, another}
This and that. Comprised of both of the members of the set {this, that}
This andor that. Comprised of both or one, still undetermined by observer. 

''One correct English phrase for this concept is "any of".''

	 :	Disagree - I've found that when I say "any of" people assume I mean "any one of". I've used "any selection from", but I usually resort to the more common "X or Y or both"

M of N -- The Disconjunctive form (ANDOR for more than two elements)
In logic notation the "conjunctionive" AND sugests (A and B) whereas the "Disjunctive" OR sugests ((A but not B) or (B but not A)) .  ANDOR offeres a neural network operator which is both Conjunective and Disjunctive or Disconjunctive and can apply to more than two items.  For instance, "any two of" [A, B, C] can be writen simply as Andor 2 [A,B,C]. Whereas to write the logical notation would require the expantion to (( A and B ) or (A and C) or (B and C))  which is more than three times as long.  For any 3 of [A,B,C,D] the expansion becomes (A ^ B ^ C) V (A ^ B ^ D) V (A ^ C ^ D) V (B  ^ C ^ D ^ ).
This simple example demonstrates how difficult it is to write the logical notation for neural functions which might have hundreds of elements.
The ANDOR expansion for more than two elements creates a highly compact representation of neural logic.

One question I might ask, is for such a simple and fundamental fact as boolean or, shouldn't the English language have one single word to make it easier?

''Maybe it should, maybe it shouldn't, but certainly it doesn't, and it is unlikely that you will be able to successfully introduce this new word into the language. English 'or' sometimes means 'inclusive-or' and sometimes means 'exclusive-or'. When the meaning is not clear from context, speakers will use "any of" or "one or more of" or '"at least one of" to mean 'inclusive-or' and "either X or Y, but not both" to mean 'exclusive-or'. Most people are not logicians, and the ambiguity doesn't matter much in everyday speech.''

Yes, yes, but those phrases are inefficient for speech and most certainly a stumbling block of thought, and ungodly for real direction, whatever it be at current to next moment. Head west, young man; those barbarians to the east are pushing us further toward the sun since we left the city near the ocean. The city of business and profit. But the world is a sphere and walking in one direction long enough will retrace one's steps. What did we do to start the cyclic direction but staring at the sun for a few moments? Look to the east to stop the madness that had once perhaps caused you fear had once started. After all, it's all about efficiency if you want a thought to go faster. English is the language of business practically around the world. WhenToSlowDownSociety. DoYouWantFreezeWithThat. -- MichaelLidman.

	1 Linguists I know (3 off), and people I've asked all claim that the English "or" is '''never''' inclusive.
	1 ZipfsLaw combined with the fact that English does not have a single word for inclusive-or implies that the concept is only rarely required
	1 The SapirWhorfHypothesis suggests that this tells us something about how people think.

Anyone else have a tendency to answer 'yes' when asked an 'or' question?  (Would you like paper or plastic?  Yes.)

There exists at least one computer language, ColorForth, for which the language primitive "or" means exclusive-OR.  If you need inclusive-OR in ColorForth, you need to define it yourself.  ChuckMoore modeled ColorForth after the machine instructions for his MISC Forth chips, which also only implemented exclusive-OR.  ChuckMoore made this design choice after looking back at his decades of work and finding he rarely needed inclusive-OR.  (Note: this is the bitwise operator; IF-THEN is used for the control-flow equivalent of inclusive-or.)

I bet Andorians have a word for this in their language
