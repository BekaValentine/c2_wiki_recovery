WikiNames are defined by being in CamelCase. Unfortunately, this is also the naming convention for classes in C++ and Java (and for function names in some styles of C/C++); thus, there is often an extreme form of AccidentalLinking, in which code written out on wiki turns out to contain links. Sometimes this is good (for example, if you ever mention StringBuffer, you get a link to an informative discussion of that class), but it is more often annoying (when code is littered with little blue question marks).

The workaround is to break up CamelCase words using SixSingleQuotes, Like''''''This. (not L''''''ikeThat -- that messes up the spell checker). This is tedious, but it works (plus, if you leave the code long enough in a visible place, the magic WikiGnome''''''s often fix it for you!).

A possible patch to wiki to escape this problem would be to disable links inside code blocks (which are defined by starting the line with a space); this would squash many of the occurrences, but wouldn't catch them all ("I hate the way you have to declare RemoteException on all the methods of a remote interface in Java!"), and would disable deliberate links that might occur in code ("/* using NullObject here */").
