One of my reasons, why I still use paper and pencil, is, that it forces me to work over the information on my
'''many''' loose sheets.

I can improve on them, discard unuseful bits and add thoughts, when going over them again.

This is often the point when I transfer them to my files and folders (where PowerOfPlainText is my friend).

Simply taking a copy (or photo in the case of white boards) and/or storing the data away just adds to the
InformationOverkill by providing 'lots' of data but only very few useful bits of information.
