Of course no such device exists or is planned, for we are far to intelligent to allow an ElectronicDevice to be so influentional in our use of seconds of time that we seem to be immersed in its presentation of technical possibilities.  We would never surrender our self-control to such devices, for they would rob us of independent volition. It sounds far to Borg-like.

But suppose such devices came into being, and we picked one up ( of course they would be HandHeld ), and we soon discovered we were reliant upon them during a large percentage of our FreeTime. And further, suppose we could not be anywhere, or go anywhere, without having the device within reach, as "we can pick it up, take it out of its pouch of rest, or, can reach it by looking into it and speaking to it, or, find out where it is by a keychain push-button, or use a desk-top device to map where it is, or where other related devices of interest are?

Doesn't that sound like a really GoodThing? A constant companion which we can physically turn-off or abandon the use of, using the strong powers of our will? What is described so far can not really be classified as belonging to a class of ElectronicHypnosisUnits. 

But suppose you (RipVanModern) had slumbered off in a deep sleep for a hundred years under a tree and as RipVanWinkle did, and you awaken and then begin to observe the world as it is in 2015. Every where you go, you see people with a small 3by5 illuminate card which seems to change it appearanc, some times with characters on it as in a typewritten card, which changes its type as you look at it, without a visible typewriter involved. At other times it looks a little like photograph, except it is in color, and it seems to be changing like as if it were a little mirror which looking over your shoulder you could see things moving. Then at other times it seems to a mixture of both, typewritten and photographed, but changing what it is as you look at it. And there seems to be a noise coming out of the card, sometimes like someone talking on a telephone, and other times like music from a gramophone.

You say to the person holding the MagicCard, hello, what is that thing you have in your hand, what are your doing? What reaction do you think that you as RipVanModern would get?
Here some possibilites:
* ''Don't bother me, I'm busy "sending Ee mail", "I em", or giggle plussing my friend who is in Cleveland while at the same time - another in Miami''
* ''Wait a second'' (Not "wait a minute" as you expected)
* ...
