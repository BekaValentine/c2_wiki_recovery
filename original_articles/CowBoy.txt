I think someone wants to be a lone player. You know; a cowboy.

Cowboy

[to the tune of Cowboy by Kid Rock]

 Well I told my momma video games would pay the bills
 cause out west there's dot com gold in them thar hills
 Find a team with a dream and I'l show'em how it's done
 with a taste of my uzi all the bad guys run

 And I'm a CowBoy who can code all night
 With a bottle of jolt till the dawn's early light
 Buy a jag with cash 'cause the first game flipped
 And we could'a wrote a sequel but the code base dripped

 Sellout short, take my goods on the run,
 Seek a second-year startup cookin' up Web Site fun.
 Teach them just one thing... I hit the road
 and they can't teach me nothin' fools just watch me code

 Start a naming convention, that changes each day
 And start a committee to interpret what my comments say
 CowBoy don't need no code rewiews
 And I'm a headin' out west, sucker...because I wanna be a

 Cowboy baby
 With a laptop open down in Silicon Valley

 Cowboy baby
 Takin' West Coast VeeCees out for a ride

 I wanna be a Cowboy baby
 Codin' at night cause I sleep all day

 Cowboy baby
 I can smell a guru from a mile away

 I bet you'll catch my bugs a bitin' before I get to work
 But to fix each one I'l charge you your shirt
 Throned king, WebRing, followin' my own star
 I once was common but I know who you are

 I work all alone so don't cross my past
 Never pair never share and I always cast
 And if the price is right I'm gonna make my show on
 Your code base stylin' for a job-hop hoe-down

 Cowboy baby
 With a laptop open down in Silicon Valley

 Cowboy baby
 Takin' West Coast VeeCees out for a ride

 I wanna be a Cowboy baby
 Codin' at night cause I sleep all day

 Cowboy baby
 I can smell a guru from a mile away

 Yeah, I'm a CowBoy you can call me Boss
 Cause the dot coms' crashed left me on top

 Seen a market for my code that you can't refactor
 And say, 'Yeah version two needs a crew down town to re-write her!'
 No kiddin, gun slingin, coupled-up un-zoom
 And I'l die long 'fore I work in a common code room

 No remorse for my style, in your eye it ain't right
 Your boss likes me better 'cause you ain't her type, uh
 Cause chaos, write like Saliere'
 Find an excuse for every abuse for my source code players

 Ninety line functions, seventeen parameters
 Copy-n-paste my way past KLOC-fright amateurs
 Why they wanna pick on me..? lock me out and hotcard my key
 I ain't no chief, my success is a failure

 I ain't straight outta grad school, writin' one big layer
 Cooooo-ment like a sailor, live at starbucks
 My only words of wisdom are just "make it work"
 I'm trickin' your runway down and out on a motion, and
 
 Keep on codin' until I fall in the ocean!
