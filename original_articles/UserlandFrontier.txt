'''There is a comment''' on the HtmlModeler
page reading: UserlandFrontier ... has been doing this for a while. There is a freeware version that is a couple of revisions old. The latest is based on a subscription type of pricing. Basically, it's an integrated object database and scripting environment (C-like syntax). The data of your website is managed separately from its presentation. It has numerous built-in scripts (which also live in the database) and can be customized to your heart's content. The scripts perform a "rendering" of the site, which can be done statically or dynamically. (This note was unsigned.)

Also see ManilaByDaveWiner who is the author of the Frontier server at http://frontier.userland.com  The ManilaByDaveWiner page is a gateway to a Manila/Frontier site that is open for test driving at:

Yet another Frontier site--this one is about Web/Internet solutions and is maintained by JonUdell author of Practical Internet Groupware published by O'Reilly and Associates--is at:

Here's a neat description of Frontier from a Web Reference interview with Dave Winer.


 "Behind the Web server, there's an object database, scripting engine, editor,
  debugger, hierarchy browser, outliner, text editor, full system-level verb set, 
  multi-threaded runtime, FTP, SMTP, POP, HTTP, XML, COM and Apple Event support and 
  a hierarchical content management system."
