The dialog that opens RefactorLowHangingFruit has been changed. The original version is worth preserving. There is considerable discussion about the issues raised here, though, so see RefactorLowHangingFruit for some provoking of thought.

A BigRefactorings dialog:

''SuperEgo'': This is never going to work, the code is a BigBallOfMud and everything smells. I need to analyze all this HighLevelArchitecture and develop a careful strategy for it.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': But the other architects will laugh at me if they see my code doesn't have a BigPicture in it.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': I need to figure out what the biggest potential modules are.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': Then I need to refactor so everything splits down the middle, and I'll have all the big potential modules in one layer, and everything else leftover in another layer.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': Then I need to divide the layer with the big modules into classes, and spend time refactoring these so they cohere to each other and don't couple to anything else.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': You know: DivideAndConquer.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': Oh shut up about that. If I just do lots of little refactors I'll still have a big blob of code, with lots of little methods extracted from it. That's hardly any improvement at all.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

''SuperEgo'': Now you are probably going to tell me that when all the lowest fruit is gone, I have to reach out to the next layer of fruit that's now low-hanging.

''Id'': Refactor the LowHangingFruit.

This is a parody of a very dull, pedantic poem - Dialog between the Soul and Mortal Self in Time - by an otherwise adequate poet, JaneRoberts.
