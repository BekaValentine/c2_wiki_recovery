A (yet another) reality TV show; on the Discovery Channel, Mondays at 8.

A crew of industry-leading meatheads assemble to take a stock car and RefactorMercilessly it for some sick purpose. Examples: Turn a New Beetle into a Swamp Boat; turn a hearse into a machine that attacks and crushes other cars; turn a Suzuki Samurai into a hot-air balloon gondola, turn a hot-dog cart into a dragster.

The show reveals teamwork, emergent leadership, team roles, mechanical & engineering principles, applied technology, design sessions, tool use, and quite droll impromptu humor.

My 7yo daughter can't get enough of this show; for her, it has surpassed MarthaStewart.

There was a short-lived similar thing in the UK called "Panic Mechanics" -- KatieLucas

Dude this is the best  show ever,this is victor it iscool.

''The above comment is intended as a recommendation for the show?'' 

I think so, the words "best" "victor" and "cool" are superlatives with positive overtones. While not widely understood, meanings can come out of it.

''Yes, I understood the words, it's the question of whether someone who expresses themselves like that will enjoy the same programmes that I enjoy.''

I think since it was short-lived in the UK and because you used the word "programmes", that it probably would not meet with your approval. I have watched several shows, and have come to like it.

''Approval and enjoyment are not synonyms. And for what it's worth, I very much enjoy ScrapheapChallenge.''

I find it extremely sad that various reality shows, including this one, seem to have taken over much of the Discovery Channel programming.  There used to be a time when one could reliably turn to Discovery for the type of good documentaries so sorely lacking everywhere else.  But I realise that I am probably part of a dwindling minority in my wish for something a little more intellectually stimulating on TV.
