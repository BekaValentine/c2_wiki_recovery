From time to time, Ward adds new functionality to this wiki. 
This is a place to keep track of those innovations:
* VisualTour
* QuickDiff
* Text search in title only. (See FindPage.)
* FindPage now searches on a static database which is updated periodically. (This means faster searches, and fewer lockouts.)
* You can set a UserName cookie which tags changed pages in RecentChanges.
* QuickChanges - RecentChanges in reverse order. (Mostly for people with PDA access.)
* Protection against conflicting edits. (See EditConflictResolution.)
* The SpellingChecker. (I believe this is only partially working now?)
* LikePages (shows pages with possibly-related titles)
* NewNotification
* PageDeletion
* SisterSites
* SignatureSurvey boils down Wiki pages to their skeletal structure
* TranslateWiki - google-assisted language translation
* WikiInnovations - keeps track of new features of this wiki
* Top ten served pages: 
*** http://c2.com/cgi/topten?do=counts&do=wiki
* Search for pages referenced that don't exist: 
*** http://c2.com/cgi/wantedWikiPages
* The read/write ratio stats: 
*** http://c2.com/cgi/wikiReadWrite

Feel free to add anything that I've missed.
