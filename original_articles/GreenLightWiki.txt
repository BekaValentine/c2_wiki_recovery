'''Presentation'''

I (BenKovitz) have written a wiki (the Green Light Wiki, because you have the green light to edit) and started a few wikis about some odd topics: 

* Main entrance: http://greenlightwiki.com BrokenLink
* http://greenlightwiki.com/heuristic All about heuristic (very new, as of 19-Aug-2003) 
* http://greenlightwiki.com/improv Improvisational comedy tips, techniques, and insights 
* http://greenlightwiki.com/lenore-exegesis Trying to figure out the writings of Lenore Thomson, someone who wrote a book with a very unusual spin on MyersBriggs
* http://greenlightwiki.com/travelog Interested in visiting a country, a city? Come and read the experiences some of the readers have lived in these places and while you are at it, write your own experiences too!
