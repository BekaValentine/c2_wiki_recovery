A sometimes problematic approach in which the starting point for the discussion is the author's ego. The author is often primarily concerned with being right, intelligent, strong, powerful, appreciated, admired, and being proven so in public.

Often this is a source of interpersonal conflict because as one ego seeks to elevate itself, an often counter force is the relative devaluation of the other egos around it. Thus, other egocentric egos react defensively and perpetuate the friction in the public spaces.

On the other hand, EgoCentrism can be a wonderful source of energy when combined with ExtremeHumility and the characteristics that a GoodArchitect shows when you ask her if she can change her architecture.
