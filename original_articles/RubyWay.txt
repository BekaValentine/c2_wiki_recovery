Doing something a very elegant way that only the programming language Ruby enables you to.

''For example?''

''copied from RubyLanguage:''

More than most OO language coders, Rubyists tend to believe in the PowerOfPlainText, using neat-o formats like YamlAintMarkupLanguage, TextileFormat, Wiki and Ruby's own native RdocFormat. While tools for all of these (except RDoc) existed in other languages first, Ruby's small developer base has allowed a very nice ecosystem to grow up around them. This seems to be becoming an integral part of the RubyWay; as far as I know Ruby 1.8 is the only language out there with YAML support in the core library distribution.

Probably the motto should just be "doing something in a very elegant way". 
As an example consider the ActiveRecord implementation in ruby :
You create the sql tables and then write this:

  class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to              :portfolio
    has_one                 :project_manager
    has_many                :milestones
    has_and_belongs_to_many :categories
  end

done. Now you can write:
  if my_project.project_manager? joe
    my_project.milestones << another_milestone
  else
    my_project.portfolio= some_pf
  end
  puts my_project.categories_count
