Is a FortranWeenie just someone who still uses FortranLanguage?

If so I am one as I am using FortranLanguage to solve EigenValue problems using ScaLapack subroutine calls. I have been using different versions of fortran since I was a student in the 1960's and still use it. I use lots of other languages as well. -- JohnFletcher
