Food for thought:

Are Agile methods inherently incompatible with CMMI?  (We believe not.)

We'd like to encourage discussion on the matter.

For now, there's a blog: http://www.agilecmmi.com/ and a group http://groups.google.com/group/agilecmmi

We encourage you to visit/join/contribute.

Hope more to appear here as well.
