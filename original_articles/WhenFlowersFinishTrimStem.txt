I noticed this phrase the other day on the instruction label that came on a plant I bought (for the record, a ''Phalaenopsis'') and was struck by its resemblance to RefactorByCondensingConversation. After the initial burst of ThreadMode activity on a WikiPage has died down, ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode: ''When flowers finish, trim stem.''

Not much more to add here - I just like the analogy.
