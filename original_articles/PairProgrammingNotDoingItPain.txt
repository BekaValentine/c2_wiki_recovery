What it is like to go from pair programming to not pair programming:

* You waste time learning a new editor in a new company because your pair is not there to type exemplary keystrokes
* Less motivation, pairs keep each other going
* The category of bugs that you didn't even realize pairing was preventing -- they all reappear!
* If you suffer from mental deficiencies (e.g., ADHD, Asperger's), you '''lose''' your train of thought, that MentalStateCalledFlow.
