RedMine is an integrated wiki, ProjectManagement tool and SourceControl repository, released under the GnuPublicLicense.

It seems to be very heavily influenced by TracWiki, but adds support for managing multiple projects and using DistributedVersionControl programs like GitVersionControl and MercurialVersionControl.

It's written in RubyLanguage and RubyOnRails.
