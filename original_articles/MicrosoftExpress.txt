''Not to be confused with OutlookExpress''

A set of lightweight DotNet tools, currently in beta, for hobbyists and nonprofessional developers. Will be released in tandem with other VisualStudioWhidbey products. 

The suite of products are intended for:
* web development
* windows application development
* database development

Most language products (not VisualCeePlusPlus) come with a starter kit which is a sample application and documentation packaged together.

See http://lab.msdn.microsoft.com/express/default.aspx for lists of products

'''News and developments'''

Aug05 MS Martin Taylor said MicrosoftExpress is an alternative to LampEnterpriseSolutions

I am interested in knowing whether the ATL library, as well as ItJustWorks capabilities exist in the VisualCeePlusPlus. Also is there a newsgroup I can check out on user experiences? -- dl

'''A''' ??

Anyone knows whether these products are as committed to important patches as the regular products (e.g. SQL Server 2005 Express will get timely patches to overcome a future Slammer-type virus?

''I'd say it was likely. MSDE (which is kind of a precursor to SQL Server Express) got Slammer patches fairly quickly''
