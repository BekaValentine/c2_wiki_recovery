Rob was a partner at OmniscientTurtle, an Agile software consulting firm. 

Previously, Rob was Director of Engineering and SoftwareArchitect for ImpartTechnology (previously named Terrace Mountain Systems). I probably hate both of those titles more than almost anyone else. Director of Engineering meant that I went to the management meetings most of the time and met with customers. SoftwareArchitect means I was the one who wrote some of the first code and some of people on the team think that I designed it. They are wrong; we designed the code. It was one of the best examples of an EmergentDesign I have seen. In my wildest dreams, I wouldn't have done that well designing the thing from the requirements at the start of the project or writing it alone.

In prior roles, he developed web/enterprise applications in Java, built software configuration management systems, developed UNIX (HP-UX) commands and kernel, did research on distributed computing at HP Labs, and designed heart monitors.
For a time, in the late 1980s, if you or a loved one were in a coronary or intensive care unit, there is about a 50%
chance you were monitored by software I wrote. It was a sobering thought for me.

Rob organized and  moderated the AustinPatternsGroup and the XpAustin group.
