Ok.  So I'm new here... and was compelled to look at this page after seeing a reference to it from the new BOIG patterns call-for-attendance.

Wiki sounds like a neat concept, so I thought I'd check it out.

I am a software architect and am terribly interested in Design Patterns, computer languages, computer program understandability, why programmers choose various forms of expression and a bunch of other stuff that I'll have to come back later and describe...
