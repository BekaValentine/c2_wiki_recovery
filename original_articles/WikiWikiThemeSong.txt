Apparently there is (or used to be) an exhibit at Disneyland
called "The Tiki Room".  (Disclaimer: I've never been to Disneyland;
I found out about this from the music CD ''Classic Disney: Volume II'' --
the blue one.)
"The Tiki Room" featured animatronic birds and flowers performing
a musical show.  The Tiki Room had a theme song titled
''The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room''.  The refrain will give you an idea
of the song and the show:

	In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room,
	in the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room,
	all the birds speak words
	and the flowers croon
	in the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room!

These words are set to a deplorably catchy tune, by the Sherman
brothers (Richard and Robert, who were also responsible for the music
in ''Mary Poppins'' and most of the other great Disney works of the 1960's).

Unfortunately, whenever I visit the WikiWikiWeb, I can't help hearing
''The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room'' playing in the back of my head.
And naturally, it's starting to evolve into a WikiWikiThemeSong.

Come on, join in and let's compose the definitive WikiWikiThemeSong!
The refrain of course begins thus:

	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	all the ... ''hmmmm... you know what? there aren't a lot of good English rhymes for "web"!''

If you've never heard the song, this will probably make very little sense
to you.  Go find a copy of the Classic Disney Blue CD and listen -- if you
dare.  (I'm serious, the song is catchy; it may warp your view of the
WikiWikiWeb forever.)

	''It's a Wiki World after all,''
	''It's a Wiki World after all,''
	''It's a Wiki World after all,''
	''It's a Wiki Wiki World.''
Somebody shoot me.

''The scary thing is, I clicked on WikiWikiThemeSong to write, "Nah, it's 'In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Room,'" after whater was there. The Tiki Room was the first attraction on the left as you entered the park.''

Well, I don't have any Disney records, but these verses are to the tune of "She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes" which is probably more widely known.

	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	everyone's a fan,
	of programming with QWAN,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web!

	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	every page you see,
	contains links to XP,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web!

	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	we all spend our days,
	trying not to navel gaze,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web!
	
	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	we try to stay on topic,
	but we're just not that myopic!
	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web!

	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,
	neophytes and sages,
	all contribute to pages,
	In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web!


It feels like a song that should be sung as a group, in a Bavarian bierkelle, while swinging (and swigging) large tankards of beer.  Perhaps at the next EuroPLoP...

The TheyMightBeGiants wiki has a tagline randomly chosen from user submissions (like unix 'fortune'), where "wiki" is cleverly substituted into various of their lyrics.  They must be up to several hundred of them now.

Here's info on the original:

There's an audio clip at the bottom of the page, so you can hear the 1963 original.

If that isn't working, http://www.hiddenmickeys.org/Disneyland/Secrets/Adventure/Tiki.html has ''tons'' of tiki room trivia, and a midi file for the song at the top.
