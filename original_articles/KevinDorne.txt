Hi.

I run a little baby WikiWikiWeb site at http://www.tentacle.net/wiki.  It's mostly used by friends and friends of friends, but sometimes the inner workings of a group of folks can be interesting to the wide world.

I created this page because I was reading the WalledGarden entry, and liked what I saw.
