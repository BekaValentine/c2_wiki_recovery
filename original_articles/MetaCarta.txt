MetaCarta merges Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with Text Search.  MetaCarta's Geographic Text Search (GTS) engine reads millions of documents, automatically extracting geographic information contained in the natural language of the documents.  Once indexed by the GTS, documents may be selected or excluded based solely upon the places mentioned in the text.  Combining geography with text search allows users to find documents that mention specific words or phrases and reference places contained inside the map window.  Natural Language references may be cities, countries, neighborhoods, buildings, monuments, relative references (i.e. 20 km south of Paris), latitude/longitude, UTM, or military grid (MGRS) coordinates.
