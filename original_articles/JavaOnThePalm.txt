Java can be run under PalmOs using the KVM.
I'm doing a feasibility study for a palm application at the moment, and I'd like to hear from anybody whose used the KVM for serious work.

Please correct me if i'm wrong:
It seems that the only way to get a Java program running on PalmOS is to compile it on some other machine, then copy the executable over. If you want to do ProgrammingOnHandHelds / OoEnvironmentForPalm, you have to pick some other language.

I've put the KVM on my Palm VII and I got the Handheld Express extension for JBuilder (http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/hhe/) which makes it ''very'' easy to build Palm apps.  Have I done any serious work? No, not yet, but I believe it's very feasible, particularly the VIIx, with 8MB, or any oher PalmOS handheld with a large memory.  The KVM itself reports its size as 273K.  A minimal application is a few K, a real one would be at least a couple of dozen K.  There's no AWT in the CLD or kjava, but at JavaOne they talked about AWT for PalmOS.  Check out this presention from JavaOne: http://jsp.java.sun.com/javaone/javaone2000/pdfs/TS-1024.pdf In fact, check out all the J2ME stuff from JavaOne. I don't think Swing is going to work any time before the end of 2000 :-).

Has anyone done anything with SuperWaba? http://www.superwaba.com.br/

Recent Palms such as the Zire 72 can  use a downloaded IBM J2ME JVM
