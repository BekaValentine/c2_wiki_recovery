You can't win.
You can't break even either.

Sounds like a tongue-in-cheek description of the first two laws of thermodynamics:
	* 0th law: there is a game
	* 1st law: you can't win
	* 2nd law: you can't break even 
	* 3rd law: You can't even quit the game

Solutions:
	* become smaller
	* slow time
	* lose gracefully

Alternatively
	* learn to create energy
