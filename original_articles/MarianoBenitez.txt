''From the PatternsList...''

Hello, my name is Mariano Benitez, and to make a short
introduction, I am a student in the Factultad de Ingenieria, Universidad
de Buenos Aires, Argentina, which is somewhere down the ecuator. 

I recently bought the GangOfFour book, and I don't think there 
is another way to make good software other than using, and developing 
patterns.

I am looking foward to contribute as much as I can in this 
newsgroup, and I do have some problems that I hope you can help me to 
resolve. I work for a hospital here in Buenos Aires, and the system
that gave me the most painful headackes is the reservation system (I hope 
you understand what I mean: ''sistema de turnos''). I ask you if there is 
already a group studying the problem or there is a pattern to solve it, 
if there is not, I hope someone help me describing and solving it.

I hope to contribute to the patterns cause, 
''los saludo atentamente, hasta la proxima!''

Mariano Benitez
