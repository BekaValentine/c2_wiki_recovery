Rhizome is a PythonLanguage WikiEngine that is a SemanticWiki. It exposes the entire site -- content, structure, and metadata -- as editable RDF. It uses a Wiki text format variant that lets the user write arbitrary RDF and XML. And WikiNames can name any arbitrary RDF resource, whose presentation depends on the context.

One benefit of this approach is that Rhizome can be used as a general purpose content management system where the author needs complete control over the presentation, including dynamically generated pages. It also supports functionality usually not found in wikis including fine-grain authorization, staging/release workflow, and generation of static copies of the site (all optional of course).
