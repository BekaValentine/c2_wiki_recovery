The culture of Lojbanistan. 

''In LojbanLanguage: lojbo kulnu or jboklu''

''xu ti poi ke'a papri ku'o cu sa'u''  -- Hope this means what I want it to mean. ;)
* stop using papri for web stuff. it's malglico.

''sa'u'' is not a ''selbri'', so we don't understand you. Maybe you meant ''sampu''.

To say something is Lojbanic, ''lobykai'', is to assert that this is more
natural to Lojban, or will become so, in comparison with some alternative.
Some think using large (multi-part) ''tanru'' is more ''lobykai'' than trying
to create a precise ''lujvo'' for every part of your (English) meaning. A
minority opinion would go even farther, & assert that the ''lobykai'' utterance
is that which most closely approximates the "four-word sentence"...

It has been observed that the ''gismu'' are semantically broad, like Latin words, & that understood portions of an utterance can be elided (e.g. pronouns) like both Latin & Japanese; but attempts at a Lojbanic style based on this have not met with unilateral approval among the community. Still, no alternatives to
date have been offered...
