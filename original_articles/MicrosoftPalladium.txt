'''MicrosoftPalladium is dead, see MicrosoftSecurity for future developments  (May04)'''


Microsoft's newest initiative, MicrosoftPalladium is purportedly an attempt to make networked computing more secure through a number of safeguards, on both the software and hardware level. Others fear that it's also an attempt to choke off the viability of non-Microsoft products under the pretense of security.

Ross Anderson of Cambridge University is writing an FAQ on Palladium and the TCPA (Trusted Computing Platform Alliance):

And I can't help but wonder: Given the non-trivial investment that large businesses have in Microsoft products, how likely is it that all of them will begrudgingly make the transition to being Palladium-compliant?

This is also Microsoft's entry into DigitalRightsManagement.
