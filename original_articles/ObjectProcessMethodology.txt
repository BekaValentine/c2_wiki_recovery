	 :	'''Object-Process Methodology''' ('''OPM''') is a holistic, integrated approach to the study and development of systems in general and information systems in particular.

	 :	In most interesting and challenging systems structure and behavior are highly intertwined and hard to separate. Meeting this modeling challenge, stateful objects and processes that transform them describe the function, structure and behavior aspects of the modeled system within a single framework in a domain-independent manner and without highlighting one aspect at the expense of suppressing another.

	 :	'''OPM''' is supported by '''OPCAT'''- Object-Process CASE Tool, downloadable from this site. Using '''OPCAT''', '''OPM''' is studies in leading academic institutes and used in industry.
