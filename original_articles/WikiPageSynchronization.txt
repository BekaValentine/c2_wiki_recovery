C2 pages have been discovered (in the past) to be synced at:
* HomePage''''''s
** http://simplewebs.com/c2/?WardCunningham
** http://simplewebs.com/c2/?HomePage
* Other C2Pages
** http://simplewebs.com/c2/?FrontPage
** http://simplewebs.com/c2/?RecentChanges

The behavior which existed in 2007, no longer occurs. This can be classified as only a W''''''ikiCuriosity at this time (20101019)

20070327 1949 -- Some problem with substitution of "simplewebs" for "c2 (ceeTwo)" at the SimpleWebs site still exist and edits made at that site will reflect in the page here. See page CostinCozianu for example. The algorithm seems to substitute the address for the synchronized page at simplewebs 
 by substituting in Urls
  "simplewebs.com/c2/" for "c2.com/cgi/wiki" 
 and by substituting
  "simplewebs" for "c2" at other places it appears
at the time the edit is made there or when a change here at c2 is synchronized there.

If you were to make this edit at simplewebs, you would find it appearing in both places with errors. Making the edit here will make it correct here, with simplewebs introducing error there without reflecting the error back.


''So who is simplewebs ? Is it Donald ?'' No!

I just discovered this site when I was searching via typing key words directly into the address bar of my browser.  I noticed that edits at simplewebs were made to the equivalent page at WardsWiki and and that changes at WardsWiki were made at simplewebs. I surmise that it is an experiment in W''''''ikiRedirection, being a F''''''irstStepStrategy of assembling and maintaining an InterWiki by using T''''''woWayRedirection involving more than one selected Wikis. -- DonaldNoyes
