''SFC - Computing in a small place (less than a desk or a table - more like a small tray) '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110113
----
The idea in SmallFootprintComputing is to make it possible to compute in a very small space, like a small working surface (as an automobile center console or aircraft seat trays, or even the top surface of your carry-on). With the coming widespread availability of 4G communication, it may soon be possible to communicate from nearly any reasonably populated or frequented areas. (Including almost the whole length of all interstate highways.)

Some IdeaAcronyms useful in explaining the driving forces behind SFC:
* SLP - Small, Lightweight, Portable
* IJF - Inexpensive, Just Enough Operating System, Flexible
* IPI - Information through Pluggable Interfaces
* NSS - Not a - Subsitute for - Standard Computing Platforms

'''Devices and systems that already exist'''

Computing and Internet browsing devices built on a SmallFootprint:
* High end
** Apple IPad
** RIM Playbook
* Lower priced
** Photographs at bottom of this page
* Some lower price entry points in this paradigm may be more useful for non-corporate types, Exhibiting different, targeted capabilities
** Sylvania Netbook
*** Off screen key board
*** OS - WinCe
*** Usb ports - 3
*** WiFi and hardwired Internet connection
*** Photo Flash Memory Card Slot - SD (Can do Photo slideshows)
*** Headphone and Microphone sockets
*** Flash and YouTube video capabilities
** PandigitalNovel
*** Os - Android
*** TouchScreen navigation (scrolling up down left right) (page flipping actions)
*** On screen keyboard comes up when editing needed
*** WiFi
*** Photo Flash Memory Card Slot - SD (Can do Photo slideshows)
*** Sound Out, No Microphone, doesn't do Flash or YouTube videos)
*** Book Reader and Book Management Including Purchasing Opportunities Online

The Pandigital device became generally available in late fall of 2010 at just under 200 dollars.
* It can be used as supplied without hacks for computing available via its internet browser and WiFi capabilities.
* It has sound and video output, but no sound input.

Asus makes a variety of netbooks and a tablet, at a variety of pricepoints from cheap to high-end. These are full PCs, not scaled-up telephones or PDAs. The drawback is short battery life.

One cyberpunk's vision of the future PC: processor & RAM in one pocket, storage drive in another on a keychain, wirelessly connecting to each other, screens, keyboards, mice, printers, other PCs, etc., when within range. PC can mostly be forgotten, ItJustWorks when you're near an interface. Walk into one room and work on one system (perhaps a TV with a game controller) then into another (with keyboard, mouse, and monitor) and start typing.  Then into another and click a pointer to display your presentation on the projector.

Battery life sufficient for at least 36 hours.

Ideally, a portable screen and keyboard could fold to the size & weight of a thin letter-sized folder, or, thicker but smaller, a paperback book (but would unfold to a nice ergonomic size). Something easy to carry around for when you're not in the vicinity of a big screen and clicky keyboard.
