Contributor/creator to AspectJay, JavaPython, IronPython, the DynamicLanguageRuntime for DotNet and other interesting projects.  In 2004 he joined the CommonLanguageRuntime team at MicroSoft.

''It certainly seems that Hugunin GetsThingsDone. His JavaPython became the most successful alternate implementation of PythonLanguage as well as the most successful of the OtherLanguagesForTheJavaVm (its development only stalled later, after he had left). He then repeated that success with IronPython.''
