Ok, but what happened to the event list and the events? ( see LittleSimulator ) 
-----
For that we need a second test, and a second person. 


 Person1 starts on Floor1
 Person2 starts on Floor2
 Person1 to request elevator in 9 seconds
 Person2 to request elevator in 6 seconds
 Remove nearest event which is request elevator for Person2 in 6 seconds.
-----

Then the event list and the events:

  S''''''ortedSet eventList = new S''''''ortedSet(); // S''''''ortedSet( events )

  class Event
  {
	Time m_time;
	Action m_action;
  }
