A type of WikiMember.

Not as bad as a WikiVandal but even more annoying and pig-headed.

Like a WikiPolice guy (and yes it's always a guy) gone horribly bad, or a WikiMaster-wannabe.

Essentially sometimes a WikiVandal acting under the guise of WikiPolice.

Writes in first-person ''plural''.  Pretends to speak for the "whole entire wiki".

''Has'' to have the last word.

WikiBoar''''''s love top-posting to a page (TopBlurting). Often in bold or italics for that extra emphasis.

Anonymous (IP address only) WikiBoar''''''s go one step further by often blurting their thoughts right in the middle of other people's sentences. Anonymous WikiBoar''''''s also especially don't hesitate to resort to vandalism when they feel they are not in control.

It's a classic case of egocentrism. They are incapable of perspective-taking, or seeing the page from other readers' perpectives. So it doesn't matter to them if a page becomes completely incomprehensible to other readers.
