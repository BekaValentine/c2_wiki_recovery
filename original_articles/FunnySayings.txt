Might I suggest that people put "Thoughts for a day" here? Try to make the reader smile. For Example:

* '''A:''' Because otherwise it would be confusing.
** '''Q:''' Why is it "Q & A" and not "A & Q"?

Suggestion: don't change this page too quickly. If the last edit was less than 48 hours ago, save your thought for another time.
