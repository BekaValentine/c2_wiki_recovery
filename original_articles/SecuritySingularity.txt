We may be reaching a security version of TheSingularity whereby we can longer sufficiently protect our systems from security threats without severely limiting our features and connectivity. The cost of security becomes so high that either we don't make much technical progress, or live with semi-permeable systems using organic Whack-A-Mole. Thus, progress will be stymied by security headaches and the full potential of connectivity-related technology will never be practically reached. The complexity of our systems is exceeding our ability to keep them hole-free. Perhaps it's an asymptote instead a singularity. Something to ponder. -t
