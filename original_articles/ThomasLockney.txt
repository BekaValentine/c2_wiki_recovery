I am a software developer in Austin, Texas. 

Between playing in a PunkRock band and remodeling my house, I try to find time for reading, drinking GreenTea, and riding my bike.

''Have you tried YerbaMate? I'm told it blends well with certain Chinese teas.''

Nope. I'm becoming more and more of a purist as I get deeper into the GreenTea thing. About the only thing I can honestly claim to like with it is ToastedRice (common in many Japanese restaurants).

Haven't been here in a while, but if anyone is reading this, you can visit my website at http://opposable-thumbs.net

Punk rock and tea are for chumps.  Like me.
