''Please maintain separate reviews for each version of each WikiEngine.  The intent is to maintain reviews of old versions of WikiEngine''''''s that might still be in use on a WikiFarm or on a specific WikiSite.  The following is the recommended approach to creating a review for a new version.''

'''Creating a Review for a New Version of a WikiEngine'''

If a new version of a WikiEngine is released and you want to review it:
	* Copy the review for the previous version
	* Rename it with the new version number, in the style of the name of the previous version
	* Modify the "master" review sheet for that WikiEngine to incorporate the new review.  (See WikiTwikiReview for an example of a master review sheet.)
	* Modify the review  for the new version appropriately (see below)

When I do a review of a new release, I will:
	* Italicize the results of the previous review (on the copy for the new release)
	* As I review each attribute, I will either change the italics to standard face type (if the comment is still appropriate), or insert new comments in standard face type.  I will mark new features with a "[+]"

''How will one find the latest release?''

I suggest keeping an active WikiReviewPointSeven etc. link always active (at the top of) this page which ''always'' points to the latest release. Alternately, Copy and Paste the Old releases to each page, and keep the latest one here. But the first method will probably cause less hassle / lost data.

I should have put a description of the approach I am already using -- look at an example and let me know whether you think it is adequate or can be improved.  Example -- see WikiEngineReviewTwiki.
