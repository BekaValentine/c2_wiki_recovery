GemStoneProfessionalServices has a reusable asset base to aid in the construction of J2EE applications - we call it the GPS Foundation Classes.  They comprise about 150 java types partitioned into about a dozen packages, and they implement a lot of the patterns and ideas in the GemStoneProfessionalServices IdeaLanguage.  See BigRefactorings for the story of their birth.  --RandyStafford
