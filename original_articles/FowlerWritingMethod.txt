* Spew pages and pages of whatever is on your mind
* Throw the pages on the floor
* Scrabble desperately around trying to figure out what they are all about (this results in throwing at least half the pages away). 

Now you have an outline with a bunch of holes. Fill in the holes and you have a book.

''In my opinion, Fowler's finished books are *still* full of holes. --top''

I once read that KarlFriederichGauss did the same thing - he edited a journal at one point and received a manuscript with a proof in it.
