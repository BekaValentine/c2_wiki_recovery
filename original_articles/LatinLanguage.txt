''My personal favorite: '''morituri te salutant'''''

What about ArgumentumAdHitlerum? Curiously, I've been compared to Hitler by my detractors on a number of occassions. Anyway, my favorite is the lyric for Monteverdi's Domine Ad Adiuvandum, 1610 Vespers:

Deus, in adiutorium meum intende:
Domine, ad adiuvandum me festina...

...and don't tell me you don't love '''benedicamus domino''' like in German Christmas carols.
