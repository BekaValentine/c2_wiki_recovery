No, a FiveStarProgrammer is not someone whose code contains five levels of indirection (see ThreeStarProgrammer''''''s).  Rather, a FiveStarProgrammer is someone who has reached the highest peaks of the programming craft - one who has reached programming "enlightenment".


* A ThreeStarProgrammer is someone who has learned to do ThreeStarProgramming and revels in doing it.

** A FiveStarProgrammer is someone who has learned ''how'' to do ThreeStarProgramming, but has also learned to ''not'' do it unless circumstances absolutely require it.  (But when they do, can do it as well as or better than any ThreeStarProgrammer).

* A ThreeStarProgrammer has achieved technical mastery in one or more languages and problem domains.

** A FiveStarProgrammer transcends it.

* A ThreeStarProgrammer writes code which is appreciated and understood by other ThreeStarProgrammer''''''s.

** A FiveStarProgrammer writes code which is appreciated and understood by even OneStarProgrammers.

* A ThreeStarProgrammer loudly demands his favorite tool or language in order that he may achieve maximum productivity, just as many fictional swordsmen (and women) fight only with their custom-forged blade.

** A FiveStarProgrammer knows that a tool is but a tool (and a sword just a hunk of metal) and is productive in ''any'' tool or language (given sufficient experience therein), just as the master swordsman can win the contest with his sword, or his opponent's.
