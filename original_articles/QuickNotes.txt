QuickNotes manages several notes in a single file database. QuickNotes allows you to embed media files including images, sound clips, or any other document directly into the note text; it will all be saved together inside the database file 

Unlike some other notes programs, with QuickNotes there is no strange markup language to learn. All content is displayed using the industry standard Windows RichEdit control. 

To make a link to another note simply double click a word. If a note already exists, a link to the existing note will be created. QuickNotes is used by writers to manage their story lines and characters, and by software developers to keep application notes organized, just to name two. QuickNotes can be useful to anyone who has to keep topical information organized in a fast and easy to use format.
