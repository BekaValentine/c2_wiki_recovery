Often when you cannot get the real parts or facilities etc. that you need you can substitute something that fills the role on a temporary basis.  Some examples are: 1) commercial parts instead of mil parts, 2) stub the program with a splash screen that says what it will do when you do that, 3) use bigger or different parts that do about the same thing so that you can get it working.  This is related to EarlyPrototyping because one of the things you often want to use functional equivalents for is getting that prototype functioning.  --RaySchneider
