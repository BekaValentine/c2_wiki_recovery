AKA Phong <phong@phong.org>.  I have a homepage I occasionally update my homepage at http://www.phong.org/.  I'm a moderator on the Gentoo forums (http://forums.gentoo.org/), and a regular on HydrogenAudio (http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/).

Favorite languages include PythonLanguage, RubyLanguage and PerlLanguage.  I'm also a big fan of QuinePrograms, PolyglotPrograms and EsotericProgrammingLanguage''''''s.

When I make time, I play the GameOfGo.  I used to collect tarantulas, but no longer have time for it (http://www.bighairyspiders.com/).
