I can't stop learning/asking questions anymore than I can stop breathing or eating (though if I cut down on the eating, the weight reduction would reduce my autocross racing times

I am currently the Team Lead for GlobalRoots

My simple Half+ is the type with a home page like this http://Winchell.org.

The other part tries to assert control by taking on things like http://Winchell.org/PCDatabaseSummit95, trying to figure out how XP can be applied to existing database systems, or racing this http://Winchell.org/PonyCar.Net/Kenny

But that's all pretty left brain. My right brain enjoys watching and performing slam poetry, listening to/playing music, hiking, travelling, comedy and romance.

If you want to see a funny picture of WardCunningham at my wedding, tell me/show me something creative and I might share it with you.
