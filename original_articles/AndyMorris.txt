Not much to say about me at the moment

VB developer from UK, originally used COBOL for 6 years, moved to VB, loved the OO aspects, really getting into XP but have no chance of getting introduced into an organisation whose main dev platform is Oracle forms.

Love WikiWiki to bits. 

Don't have anything to say to anyone at the moment, still exploring XP and wiki, so i thought i'd use this page as my todo list, also a sort of diary of my thoughts 

'''Things to look at'''

* PlanningGame
* SpikeSolution
* CrcCard''''''s
* Try VbUnit at work, got to decide who to tell first, the DevSupport guys won't like it 

'''Pages To Write'''

* TheSqlParadox
* GuiProcedureScripts
* ComplexityHidingSupidity
* DoingMultiThreadedGuiInVisualBasic
