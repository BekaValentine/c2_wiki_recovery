A strategy for dealing with PageRank spam on wiki. A special page is created to hold a list of spammers' IP addresses and/or hostnames. Each edit is checked against this list before being accepted. As new (first-time) spammers hit wiki, or existing spammers change IP addresses, the new addresses are added to the list by WikiGnome''''''s.

Here are some resources:

WikiEngines with built-in support for blacklisting:
* MediaWiki is about to support this: 
*** http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/mediawiki-l/2004-December/002666.html
* CommunityWiki
*** http://www.communitywiki.org/cw?BannedContent
* ZwiKi
** The banned_links, max_anonymous_links and max_identified_links properties are no longer supported.
*** http://zwiki.org/zwikidir/.build/html/tests/CHANGES.html

Some drawbacks:
* This solution has a high administrative overhead.
* Doesn't catch new spam the first time.
