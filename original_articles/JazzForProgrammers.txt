Many programmers like JazzMusic. Jazz can be relaxing, stimulating, intellectually challenging, sometimes even beneficial while programming. I opened this page to explore programmers' preferences in conjunction with the activity of programming. 

The reason for this page is basically that there's jazz and there's jazz. Some jazz goes best for concerts, some for entertainment, some for "sex", some for romance, etc. What Jazz do you think goes best with programming ?

I'll open the list, with some of my preferences:

* JacquesLoussier. Mostly everything, but especially the Baroque Favorites album.
* "Autumn Leaves"  (favorite interpretation: Miles Davis, Bill Evans).
* Bill Evans -- mostly everything
* John Coltrane "My Favorite Things"

While not strictly Jazz, I am a big fan of Jazzy Drum and Bass while programming.  LTJ Bukem, Makoto, Blame and London Elektricity to name a few artists.
