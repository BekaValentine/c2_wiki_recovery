Apollo Computer developed a network-based workstation called the Apollo Domain. They were way cool, but apparently also way ahead of their time. MentorGraphics OEM'd the equipment and thereby became their largest customer. Apollo was eventually acquired by HewlettPackard, making the latter the world's largest workstation supplier, at least for a while. Mentor ported their stuff off domain and onto generic unix.

''I don't think they were way ahead of their time so much as just better than Sun's WorseIsBetter workstations and UNIX.''
