Hello Folks, this is my CategoryHomePage.

I'm showing this to to my friend Evan Tinney

This is a test page for me, since I really need to learn how to Wiki. so I can RollYourOwnServer

I've seen some lists.
	* weird 
	* weirder
	* wierdist
	1. A numbered List Item.
	1. Another numbered list item
	Term:	Defined

What else can I learn Wiki-ish?

The can't type tabs thing is annoying, using Mozilla on a Linux box for my desktop system.

	 :	I am attempting to make this paragraph be block quoted. I dunno if this will work or not, but I'm running out of things to say and I really want to make more than one line for this test. So you now get my rambling. 

Unfortunately, I really need to be able to enter superscript and subscript for the sort of information I need to wiki. 

''Which is?''

Which is primarily stuff involving math so powers and iteration indicators can be important. Greek symbols would also be nice.

''Check out MathWiki and TwikiClone. Twiki has a LaTex plugin.''

In any case, this has been interesting.

Welcome to wiki; check out TextFormattingRules and TourBusStop.
