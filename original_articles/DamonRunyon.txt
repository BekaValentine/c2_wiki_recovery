In the twenties, thirties & forties, Runyon is this famous writer of short stories who makes lots of yucks out of the toings and froings of hard-handed but soft-hearted guys and dolls. Runyon is famous for his exclusive use of the present tense, as well as inventing colorful jargon left and right. Anyone who doesn't already familiarize themselves with this gee should seek out his two great anthologies, "On Broadway" and "First to Last". Furthermore, those who already know him will want to read him again often or else someone might get antsy with a john roscoe and make them not so healthy, at that.

Runyon's misquoted:  it's "I long ago COME to the conclusion...."   If you're quoting Damon Runyon, this make a big difference "to one and all."
