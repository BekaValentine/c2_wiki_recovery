I guess a guy who likes RockMusic?

DinerRock is a relatively new style of RockMusic created by EddieMonah that seeks to "maximise the full diner atmosphere." It has an intentionally campy surrounding, and only uses four parts: the upright bass, the trumpet, the honky-tonk piano, the vocals and the resonating chamber. It is an experimental genre, fusing DooWop, RockaBilly, MusicHall, FreeJazz, YAY!, BluesMusic, HonkyTonk, and MoTown. It originates in SpringdaleDiner.
