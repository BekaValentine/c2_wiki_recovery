	 :	Our mission is to create and gain wide adoption for software applications of uncompromising quality using Open Source methods. Our first product, now under development, will be used to manage email, appointments, contacts, and tasks and easily allow information to be shared with friends, family, and colleagues. It will be free and will run on the Windows, Macintosh and Linux platforms. It will not require a server or complex administration.

	 :	We are committed to serve the broad base of users while also offering advanced capabilities for the more expert user. Above all, we are committed to keeping the end-users' interests and needs central to our undertaking.
