I also edit a lot of pages. The single most common edit I do is to place related comments together. The second most common edit is to delete the duplication that becomes obvious once comments are adjacent. This works because I, as editor, can rely on context that wasn't present when the contributions were made. My third most common edit is to remove "protocol words" that may be required in conversation but are not important to the future reader. For example, someone might start a post by explaining that they don't mean to offend. I would remove such an introduction and then edit the remaining comment so that it simply does not offend.

In my first programming job, I worked for DaveDodson at the PurdueComputingCenter. Dave would chuckle when he saw the students poring over their listings oblivious to the little trick that would make their programs trivial. Of course, he had to explain the tricks to someone.

''When Wiki was new, I wrote a page about myself that sprawled over half a dozen page names describing various places I've worked. While editors have been kind enough to let those pages persist, authors have been wise enough to not follow that example. I've now brought all that content home:''

Over the years I've learned a few things...

'''Highland High School'''

I learned to program while in high school in the middle sixties. My buddy JerryDijak was learning to program in IITRAN using the teletype that had recently been installed in Mr Clark's math room. He explained that you wrote ''instructions'' for the computer to follow. Then he showed me the program he was working on. It was mostly incomprehensible, except for the occasional instruction like...

	go to town
	go to bed
I was fascinated that such instructions might make sense to a computer. I now know that they meant nothing, that Jerry had missed an opportunity to make meaningful labels, and that goto's are bad on principle. Still, I have a certain fondness for goto's since they got me started in computing.

''Hi Ward, just wanted to say that it has always amazed me that programmers (and I am one of them), seem to universally condemn GOTO, yet it is in most languages I have used. If it is so horrendous why do we not just remove it from the syntax, or do we still find a guilty pleasure in finding uses for it?''

''Thanks for these pages; they are a pleasure to read. -- jss''

'''Purdue University'''

''The PDP-9 Room.'' I joined BillCroft and DaveKruglinski as a regular in the NineRoomAtPurdue. I wrote an animated football game that never quite worked. I felt like I'd been inching that beam along one statement at a time. Bill did an electrical circuit input program -- a diagram editor. He had better abstractions. He'd been studying IvanSutherland.

''System Time on the CDC.'' ... watching the heavies...
RichKovaric, VicAbell, RossGarmoe.

''Mechanical Engineering's Graphics Lab.'' ... had eight one hour periods to write a graphic editor ... trouble was a compile took 45 minutes ...

''ARPAnet.'' ... they had a binder back then that listed every host, listed accounts and passwords, and suggested cool things to play with ... HarryChesley made a lot of friends. I remember his super hierarchical chat ... Harry and JimBesemer struggled for a while ProgrammingTheIliacIV.

''Network Simulation.'' ... wrote a 5 page program that exhibited behavior I couldn't understand ... have produced many charts, graphs, reports and animations since ... still can't tell why it does what it does ...

'''Tektronix'''

I joined TekLabs out of school. I liked the name. It reminded me of BellLabs.

Tektronix did a lot of early microprocessor work in a system affectionately called a BoardBucket. Hardware guys would whip up all kinds of neat boards. There was even a MicroprocessorFair where some were shown off.

But the board bucket wasn't going to scale to 16-bit processors. So JohnProvidenza built a few systems for us on the then emerging MultiBus backplane. They were shared-memory multi-processors. John did excellent work. But a system's only as good as its components...

* TeslaCompilerHadBugs
* MultiBusBackplaneHadBugs
* MemoryCardsHadBugs
* MicroProcessorHadBugs

I wrote the operating system and most of the applications for this system. I was very good at debugging. A few lost souls would try to use an InCircuitEmulator in this environment. They spent most of their time debugging the ICE. I used a handful of homemade tools...

* StatementTrapHandler
* MessageQueueInspector
* StatePortDisplay
* InterpretingLogicAnalyzer
* MissingEventTrigger

Some were my own design. Others were by JeffBradford. All were specially designed to work in the multi-processor environment. They were particularly good for hunting problems that weren't easily identified as hardware or software.

I got tired of working on small machines. I moved into integrated circuit design when that field started showing some respect for software guys. They were at least buying them big computers. I found designing with bare transistors to be much easier than prepackaged ICs. I studied chip architecture. I particularly liked the SystolicPriorityQueue which I thought of while designing the PictureModelChip.

I used Smalltalk to build a silicon compiler. I got more points for making something out of Smalltalk than I ever got for making anything out of silicon.

'''Wyatt Software'''

I left Tektronix convinced that I knew how to organize large programs as objects. I underestimated how distracting schedule pressure would be. Still, I managed to keep our development flexible enough to respond to unanticipated change. I used a process that we would now call refactoring. Over time I adjusted how we scheduled and explained that schedule to management. Here are a couple of documents written as the impact of what I was doing was starting to emerge in my thoughts.

'''Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc.'''

I've founded my own company, http://c2.com, which continues to host this site.

'''Microsoft and beyond'''

As of December, 2003, I took a position at Microsoft with the title Architect. I worked with a group I had consulted to for a year while they produced http://msdn.com/patterns. I know that some authors here have no good will for the company. Please remember I remained the same person. I also invited TipsForWardAtMicrosoft.

''Are you going to relocate to the Seattle area, or continue living in PortlandOregon?'' [both -- Ward]

''How does this affect future work on Fit, given that MicroSoft won't allow GPL work?'' [c2 owns fit and will continue to exist -- Ward]

'''EclipseFoundation'''

I realized a long term ambition of working closely with BjornFreemanBenson. One cool thing to come out of the collaboration was the testing framework called ''swim'' and the documentation built on it called ''process explorer''. We wrote about this for the PacificNorthwestSoftwareQualityConference: http://c2.com/pnsqc2007/paper.pdf.

I also passed through a couple companies without staying long enough to learn much or have much impact. That doesn't mean I didn't make some good friends though...

'''Knowledge Systems'''

(Ward, I'm taking the liberty of writing this for you. Feel free to edit or change any misconceptions -- KyleBrown)
For a very short time, Ward worked with the folks here at KnowledgeSystemsCorporation. In particular, he helped SamAdams, KenAuer and LynnFogwell develop an advanced/rebuilt version of HotDraw called Foundations. Alas, Ward did not stay long here on the east coast, as his beloved Pacific Northwest sang its siren call to him once again.

'''IBM Consulting Group'''

Hi Ward. I would be honored if you'd drop by at BookShelved sometime - a short perusal of your "recent book purchases" list above convinces me that you'd like the place as well as bring your own special light to it. -- LaurentBossavit

Ward, I've just discovered BookShelved and been very impressed with it. Could I suggest the possibility of it becoming a SisterSite? If it was, I think that a lot of book pages that currently sit a little uncomfortably on Wiki might have a natural home. What do you think? -- EarleMartin.

''Seconded. I've wanted this for a while but was afraid to ask. -- JoeWeaver''

I agree, but I think it is a perfect medium for all books, including those that are OnTopic here and would provide an excellent taxonomy for some of this site's content. Another step in the refactoring of WikiDom as Pete would say. -- MarkTilley

''I found this in a bio I wrote a few years ago. ...''

I'm interested in large scale systems with distributed control.
I take my inspiration from economics, politics, language, learning, culture and, of course, life itself. I'm most satisfied when I write software that borrows from such systems. I'm working on a distributed architecture that favors robustness over correctness. If you think you will miss correctness, consider these questions from the fields I mention:

* What is the price of bread?
* How are decisions made in a democracy?
* Who puts meaning in metaphor?
* What limits storage in a neural network?
* Are folk tales true?
* What stops an immune response?

A few elections ago a fellow I knew put up a web site with his own platform as if he were running for president. Of course some of his ideas were outside the reach of the office. But who cares? It was fun. Here is my version. Were I to run for president, this would be my platform.

* The combination of an aging population and a blossoming of biotechnology means that we will spend more on health care. My administration will accept the responsibility for the basic health of all citizens while supporting medical and biological research and fostering an entrepreneurial environment for advances in diagnosis and treatment.

* The relentless growth in population and corresponding consumption of resources means less for everyone, even us. My administration will attack the consumption spiral by redefining want. We will start by replacing the advertising industry with an information industry, first by nationalizing Google, and then by rewriting trademark, copyright and patent law to favor distribution of that which is easily duplicated, and conservation of that which is not.

* The complexity of subjects and diversity of students renders any notion of uniform testing foolish. My administration will make testing and grading an extracurricular activity like sports or debate and thereby relieve public school teachers of their most unproductive daytime burden. If employers want a unidimensional metric for hiring, let them pay for it themselves. If the smart kids want to compete for validictorian, let their parents form a booster club and host bake sales to pay for the examinations.

* In order to increase access to our elected representatives, and to decrease access of same by assorted lobbys, I would require that all floor speeches given and all votes cast be done so electronically by the member from his home soil, preferably from a library, union hall or city club.

* As commander in chief I will bring the troops home and send the citizens over seas. Every American will be eligible for a four week sabbatical so long as they complete two weeks of night classes on the culture they will visit before going, attend another two weeks of cultural immersion while abroad, and fly on an American airline when they go.

'''Questions for Ward about WikiWiki technical issues'''

* Ward: Following the advice in WikiStyle and TenWordLine, I'm experimenting with a browser-selected .CSS file to make reading text easier. I'd like to use the CSS to control page background color and body text color, but the Wiki pages automatically set the background color to white and the body text to black. Could you remove these settings from the html that Wiki generates... so we can control the colors via the browser CSS file? Would greatly appreciate it... JonDonahue (UserStyles)

* Any chance of correcting the minor problems with ISBN links (see WikiWikiBugs for details)?

* Why does your robots.txt file no longer exist? (There's a new one now.)

* What do you think of adding link to TextFormattingRules near GoodStyle link in the EditPage? ''Second that. Probably had to do that search 10 times.''

* Why are WikiWikiBugs generally left unfixed?
** ''Any chance you could fix the 'capitalized file extensions are not recognized as pictures'-bug? For an example, see the picture of CalvinMooers.''

* Plural names suggestion, requiring a little help from the administrator. Since wiki is now kept as separate files on disk, it would be easy to set up one file as a symlink to the other. For example, '''Unit''''''Test''' and '''Unit''''''Tests''' would both exist, but the latter would be just a symlink on disk to UnitTest. I tried this with my personal wiki and found it quite nice. Still working on how it might be implemented, but it should be possible to at least identify pages that differ only in a trailing 's' and have wiki create the soft link if it doesn't exist. -- StevenNewton

* On WantedPages, BigOmega turns up 10 or 15 times, but there's a SisterSites version. It would be great if pages such as this could be filtered out, and I'm sure the logic that decides whether to link a WikiWord or put a "?" could be adapted. Thoughts? -- WikiGnome wannabe
** ''Good idea. I could also exploit the fact that everything is sorted to do this as a merge, not individual lookups. (There are a lot of names on that list.) -- WardCunningham''

* Ward, is there any chance that http://c2.com/wiki/links.zip will ever be updated? -- AdewaleOshineye
** ''http://c2.com/wiki/links.txt is updated nightly. It has a little less information in it but at least it is current. -- WardCunningham''

* When I click on the header of DoTheFirstThingThatMightWork, it answers that no references were found, even though it is referenced by RecentChanges and RefactoringByResistance. Is this simply some sort of caching latency, or is there a deeper problem with back-references? -- TomStambaugh
** ''The index that this search uses is updated once a day at 2 am pacific time. The only immediate search is the "title search" available on the FindPage. Sorry for the inconvenience. -- WardCunningham''

* When did you change the wiki to have the non-existent page question mark at the end instead of the beginning of the WikiWord?
** ''It has always been at the end here. Moving it to the front was one of BoLeuf's many contributions to the wiki we distribute with TheWikiWay.''

* Please see the end of TabRefactoring. Is it intended to drop numbered lists eventually?
** ''If I could turn back the clock, I wouldn't include them in the first place. But right now I have no intention of removing them. -- Ward''

* Will the unintended "monospaced bullet point" shown in TabRefactoring be fixed? -- vk

* The http:hp?WikiInHyperPerl link is not working. Is there a link that does?
** ''Not yet. I intend to repair the translator for historical purposes only. There are better ways to get a wiki, though. -- Ward''

* My comment in RobotsDotTxt relates to what you said in WikiWikiSystemNotice, is it helpful? How much confusion would be caused by shuffling the URLs? And if the old URLs served permanent redirections to the new locations? I don't know whether the 'noindex' meta tag will stop robots ''fetching'' the page. -- MatthewAstley

* I'd like to draw your attention to a solution to the ShotgunSpam we seem to be experiencing more and more.

Hi, Ward. Thank you for providing this Wiki! -- AndrewMartin

You're Welcome -- WardCunningham

It took me a while to realize that I had taken classes at PSU from your wife and business partner, KarenCunningham. Her compiler course was excellent, but I missed out on her Object Oriented Programming class. I'm surprised she doesn't have a page of her own here. -- IanOsgood

You missed a good one. She founded our business teaching that one to corporate clients. And, yes, I too am surprised that she doesn't have a page of her own here. -- WardCunningham

I've just with great interest read your discussion on PhotoWiki at http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?PhotoWiki and had to write one immediately. It's at http://photowiki.ywp.d2g.com and written in my HtagLanguage just as the HtagWiki is.
I would love to hear if I got close to the ideas you had about this concept two years ago. I hope you are still interested.

----

What was the inspiration for the simplified mark-up language that is used in Wiki? In the Python world, there's StructuredText and ReStructuredText that are in the same spirit, and I know that they were '''''not''''' inspired directly by WikiMarkup, but they were influenced by Python's use of meaningful whitespace. Any history pointers for WikiMarkup?

''I copied some ''nroff'' conventions like preserving blank lines. The rest I made up on the spot. See WikiHistory. -- WardCunningham''
----

Time, a lot of good will, a lot of understanding, a strong will to compromise and to understand the consensus, vigilance, a good strategy and a few deterrents are of essence and ultimately, yes wiki will work for us if we want it to work. But we have to work hard at it! But Wiki fails to work in very few specific problems though.

Hi Ward, I dropped a question on BlubParadox in response to something you said there. I imagine you might not have seen it so I thought I'd let you know here. But if you saw it and just don't feel like answering, that's cool too. -- PeterSeibel

----
Hi Ward,
It would be helpful if the name S_Expressions were allowable/interpreted as a link to a page title; i.e. if "_" counted as a lower case letter. There is some discussion on the page EssExpressions, which no one considers to be a good name for Lisp "S-Expressions", and which someone recently renamed "SymbolicExpressions", but that name means many, many things beyond just Lisp S-Expressions.

And over the years when coding and using CamelCase, I've run across many instances similar to this where an underscore was really the way to go, to separate otherwise adjacent capital letters.

So what do you say, would it harm anything for underscore to count as lower case, thus allowing "S_Expressions"?
thanks,
-- DougMerritt

''I'm the one who changed "EssExpressions" to "SymbolicExpressions". For now, I've reverted them all to "EssExpressions", if for no other reason than to make them consistent with "XmlIsaPoorCopyOfEssExpressions". If wiki is changed to interpret an underscore as a lower case letter, I'll gladly change EssExpressions to S_Expressions. Thanks --''

Doug - wouldn't people then start using underscores to separate words? I mean, it would be tempting. Also, aren't WikiWord''''''s TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork? -- EarleMartin

Good points. As for simplest, sure, things have worked without this change until now. On the other hand, there '''are''' these occasional troublesome cases. I have no problem with "CeeLanguage", but "EssExpressions" just doesn't look right, it '''always''' looks like a kludged hack workaround. I think it's because it doesn't begin with "S", whereas "CeeLanguage" does begin with "C". There are other cases that don't work well (not that I've kept a list). ''Is Ses instead of Ess too much of a perversion?''

As for misuse of the proposed feature, it would be fairly trivial to limit its use to only the situation where underscore follows a single capital letter, so that e.g. Lisp_Language would fail the rule and not be recognized as a WikiWord, removing the temptation to start using this with abandon. -- DougMerritt

It bugged me when I first started lurking too, but now that I've gotten used to the WikiAlphabet, Ess looks more natural than S_. Besides, you could argue that
  (let ((S_Expressions EssExpressions))
	(read-page S_Expressions)
	(edit-page S_Expressions))
always looks like a kludged hack workaround, but thousands of SmugLispWeenie''''''s still deal. ;) -- JonathanTang

When did you first start lurking, anyway? Well, '''if''' there's only a couple of us that dislike the form "EssExpressions", then I suppose it's a losing battle (but so far only Jonathan has explicitly given a thumbs-down to my idea). I am actually surprised you say "Ess looks more natural", though. -- DougMerritt

Hrmm. I believe I found it through a comp.object post, which means during my summer job after freshman year. So summer 2002. I think my first edits were late last spring or early last summer, then I forgot about it for most of the semester. And I've found a general rule of syntax is that whatever you're most familiar with looks most natural. I see EssExpressions and EssAndKayCombinators and XmlIsaPoorCopyOfEssExpressions often enough that they're reasonably familiar, but I've never seen S_Expressions before. If it was S-expressions, though... -- JonathanTang

I think I'm beginning to grok that this will never happen, regardless of reasoning one way or the other, because Wiki is heavily oriented towards DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork, regardless of whether it is imperfect or inconvenient or whatever. I'm not sure I entirely agree with that philosophy, but Wiki has proven that it is a workable way to go at some times in some circumstances. -- DougMerritt
----
Ward, a big ThankYou is in order. I think recent events here have been a real test of your wiki philosophies, and you have the patience of Job for dealing with it as you have. Until I saw WikiWikiSystemNotice, I've been half expected to see a notice one day that you'd either closed up the Wiki shop or else frozen it a la WhyClublet. -- TimLesher

''Someone from Brazil had edited it to add a message to the bottom, and in the process garbage binary characters were added throughout. This gave diff indigestion. I cleaned it up, but diff still complains because the previous version has the garbage characters. -- DougMerritt''
----
Ward, you said above "I intend to repair the translator for historical purposes only." However, you never did, and, in fact, you haven't changed Wiki in years except occasionally to add a feature. Is that your policy? To change nothing, even things that don't work properly?

Just to let you know, the link to the patterns list archive at http://c2.com/ppr/letters/ is now dead. -- EarleMartin

Copied from another page discussing edit wars etc:

''This wiki is a perfect example of how not to administer a wiki.''

For your goals, perhaps. For Ward's goals, this may be the perfect way to do it. Who knows? He certainly could do any kind of manual or automatic intervention he pleases. Since he mostly doesn't, you shouldn't be so sure you can guess what he is really up to.

Originally, he participated himself. Now he barely does. His old friends (first the patterns community, later XP folks) are long gone; the current crowd (like me) are basically squatters. The topical direction of the wiki is all over the map. There are any number of possible goals he has these days that might be quite different than what you'd guess.

For instance, maybe it's a long-running science experiment, and it would invalidate the results to do things differently prior to a pre-designated end. Who knows?

''Ward DeleteWhenRead''

I was using http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiWikiWeb page as a means to discuss with others who are concerned with the future of wiki, while C2 is locked out from edits. A week later there have not been much activity on that page.

''Some locked out people have started to use http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ShortMessagesWikiWikiWeb for key requests, etc. Do you have another edit key that can be passed out by existing key holders?''
* A secondary key is useful in case the key is passed out to the wrong party.

Meanwhile if you can make sandbox exempt from your edit lock out scheme then new users can still experiment with concept of wiki. Also consider a note on FrontP''''''age and WelcomeV''''''isitors to inform occasional visitors of temporary changes, not many people know about WikiW''''''ikiSystemNotice (I first learned about it in 8 months or so earlier) -- DavidLiu

I support Costin (now retired contributor according to his words in WikiWikiSystemNoticeDiscussion) suggestion (and reasons) for resurrecting Minor Edits. Having said that, I would watch out for resurgence of WikiTrolling and would respond with ShieldsUp quickly if needed. Thanks for attention and using my acronym. -- dl

Is the OrphanPage WikiWikiPlans still pertinent? Asked a day earlier by 206.169.234.162

Ward please consider means to reclaim the GoogleLovesWiki reputation. I was looking for EDGE (GPRS) material and can no longer rely on GoogleSearch on C2 site to locate such information. This loss could contribute to excessive fragmentation of material in the wiki.

I would also like to have AutoPcn permitted to be run again, if the original owner is willing to operate it. It would be good to have a watchlist similar to WikiPedia in action.

Only thing I would add is to make the country have a WikiConstitution editable by all with associated changes becoming laws effective immediately. I would also mandate all religions have WikiBibles.

How do you correctly pronounce Cunningham in your name? Is "h" pronounced as in /cunning-ham/ or not as in /cunning-&m/ ? Or both allowable? (Sorry for my ignorance.)

A very nice article about Ward was recently published in the Oregonian ("The Web's Wizard of Working Together"):
* http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/index.ssf?/base/business/1134801095290920.xml&coll=7&thispage=1

In this article, Ward was described as "Old Growth in the Silicon Forest", a term that all his friends enjoyed.

Ward - I'm a wiki/blog/RSS geek, and have implemented a company-wide pedia-like wiki at Intel with great success. People love it, and it's quickly supplanting the more complex and clunky tools for collaboration. I'm also a podcaster/videoblogger, both personally (http://www.tinyscreenfuls.com) and at Intel. Would you be interested in coming in to Intel to talk about wikis, open source, or another topic of your choosing? I was thrilled to learn that the inventor of the wiki lives almost literally in my backyard, and I'd love to meet you, and start some conversation at Intel.

You can contact me at jabancroft@gmail.com or 503.810.5365. I figured it was apropos to contact you via your wiki. :-) -- JoshBancroft

Hi Ward

At work we're running a really old version of DevWiki. I was wondering how difficult it is to migrate from this to your latest version (supplied with the book if I understand it correctly)?

The truth is that the existing version works for us but would work so much better if we could manage versions and create some pages as Read-Only.

Thanks for the years of useful Wikiing we've had.

Gavin

''FYI Ward responds on this page extremely rarely (approximately never), although he sometimes responds to email. He's a busy guy, what can I say.''

''The wiki supplied with the book is the latest '''available''', but is by no means the current running version, which is not available for a variety of reasons. I believe the book's wiki is considered interesting if you plan to hack the code, otherwise an actively supported wiki code base is probably preferable.''

''For a starting point on which wikis to consider using, see ChoosingaWiki - but be aware that such discussions are not particularly kept up to date; there are a truly bewildering number of wiki flavors these days.''

I have only just found out that Mr. Cunningham has joined AboutUs. It is a terrible shame that a man with such ingenuity has turned his back on real Wiki development and joined an organisation which could simply be described as a 'Web Scraper' (see Wikipedia for the definition). They are not a real Wiki as their contents are built from the automated harvesting of other peoples hard work.

''It is true that I work for a living and now work for AboutUs. Further comments on AboutUs policy should be directed to that site or the customer support they provide. -- WardCunningham''

Ward, how does it feel to have the word "wiki" in the organization that may just trigger WW3?
