The '''industrial economy''' is defined by the production of ''physical'' goods, outside of a guild system, which is to say: ''en masse''. It is marked in its consumption of earth's mineral and energy resources and its use of labor, where the human is reduced to a mere "cog in the machine". Or being part machine, part human, with very long-life expectancy. Not much different from the Sci-Fi "Borg".
