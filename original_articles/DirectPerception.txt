''Wait. Suppose I did read these words, infer meaning, and become emotional. Did not the light of my monitor strike my retinas? If not, then I have perceived only indirectly. However, if the monitor's glow illuminated my retinas, then that was direct perception. Everything that happens to the signal is the direct perception of some prior state of that signal. Indirectly, I determine that someone thought up some idea which they codified in this page, and who could question that conclusion? It is a fact, and I know it, but only because I've had the direct perception of my monitor while awake.''
