'''agent-oriented information system (AOIS)'''

AgentOriented information systems represent a new information system paradigm where communication between different (software-controlled) systems and between systems and humans is understood as communication between agents whose state consists of mental components (such as beliefs, perceptions, memory, commitments, etc.). In enterprise information systems, for instance, the AOIS paradigm implies that business agents are treated as first class citizens along with business objects.
