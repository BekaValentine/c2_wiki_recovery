Short synopsis:

* A WikiLurker that contributes something meaningful (or not so meaningful) every so often.
* A person who, even after 15 years, is still learning more and more about his chosen craft (software development)
* A big believer in IndividualResponsibility, although I don't think it's an absolute

My home page is at http://www.evandeaubl.com, FWIW.

MyMyersBriggsTypeIs ISFP, although that has kind of morphed over time.  Early tests I took labeled me INTJ, then I took a full test which labeled me ISFJ, but my most recent type resonates with me more than any of the previous ones have.
