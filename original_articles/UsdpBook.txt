I bought this book and it sat on my shelf for ages. Then I took it on a short holiday with me (which qualifies me as a sad bastard, especially by my wife) and absorbed myself in it. But coming from a company with too many ''ad hoc'' internal processes, I returned from holiday a wiser person. -- AndrewJoyner
