In a few cases wiki helper scripts use HTTP_REFERER rather than encode page names into urls. This is done specifically to foil agressive spider software that would thrash these scripts otherwise. Some people use browsers that don't send referer, or firewalls that don't pass it through. This is probably what is happening if you get a message that says ...

	* ''No page name given.''
	* ''No search word given (or HTTP_REFERER blocked).''

You should see the HTTP_REFERER field in there somewhere. You wouldn't see it if you just type the url into your browser. And you won't see if your software is blocking it.
