Started off not in the IT business at all, and was lucky enough to be offered a job by WDS around 5 years ago. Since then I can skip on a few years and say that I've been lucky enough to see how XP is done with the likes of OliBye, KeithBraithwaite DafyddRees and RichardEmerson. Since then, I moved across the company and started a small development team. Try as much as I can at the moment to fit in as much XP as I can (story boards, wiki, velocity) but alas, no stand up meetings (not easy having a stand up meeting and passing a "talk token" between just two!)

Seems like I have taken on some legacy systems, but at least now I can choose the .net language I work in (opted for C#) and write some funky tests first. Been using TestRunner which is a great VS.NET plugin that uses nNunit as its engine, but is a dockable window, so it is just like using jUnit in Eclipse. 

The things I really miss from using Eclipse are the re-factoring tools, though another VS.NET plugin available at http://www.xtreme-simplicity.net/ solves this (all but at a cost unfortunately) Though I see that the next VS.NET edition will have all these built in already. In fact as far as I remember, the refactoring menus practically mimic those of Eclipse.
