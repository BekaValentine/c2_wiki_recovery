SelfDiscipline is the ability to direct oneself to a particular purpose or end.  Some people might call it ''willpower'', but broad perception and attention to detail are often just as necessary.  Mentioned here as related to BondageAndDiscipline, where the direction is provided externally (even if you begged for it).
