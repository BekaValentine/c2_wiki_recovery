Boy Scout motto! Related to various strategies such as PearlHarborFile and WatchYourSix. -- RaySchneider

  Be Prepared!
    That's the boy scouts' marching song
  Be Prepared!
    As through life you march along
  Be prepared to hold your liquor pretty well.
  Don't write naughty words on walls if you can't spell.
