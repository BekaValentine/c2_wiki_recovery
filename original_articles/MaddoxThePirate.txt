Maddox the Pirate is the pseudonym for George Ouzounian, a native of Utah who achieved Internet fame through humorously inflammatory diatribes on his website, The Best Page in the Universe (http://maddox.xmission.com or http://thebestpageintheuniverse.net), on issues from the hypocrisy of pop culture to crappy children's artwork, beginning in 1997. He holds a degree in Mathematics from the University of Utah and formerly worked as a programmer for a telemarketing company, though selling merchandise and sales of his recent book, The Alphabet of Manliness, now sustain him financially.
