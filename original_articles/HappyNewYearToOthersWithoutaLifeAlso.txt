Happy New Year to my geeky homies out there. Cheers to not having a life! (clink clink)

''Ditto! This is the first year in a while I've had no life on New Year's Eve! (glug glug)''

Here's the marital bliss from which I look enviously upon your lifelessness. Xmas for me is _supposed_ to be when I catch up on all my side-projects. Instead, my loving family makes me drive 2,000 miles, total, for no apparent reason, through featureless countryside, and in blithering disregard to all the mass-transit options. Oh, and because of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy , we can't just take one fucking train ride, like people can in civilized countries.

Then I finally get to pick the New Year's venue, mercifully across the street from our world HQ...

Not having a life is a life goal, huh?
