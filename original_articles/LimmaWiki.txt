''Each section below (bounded by horizontal lines) contains a single work-in-progress.  You can start a new limerick with any line, part of a line, rhyme, or idea that you want to get across (expressed in prose, even).  You can work on limericks by adding to unfinished ones.  You can create variants of finished works or works-in-progress by making a fresh copy with the changes.  The only rule is that everything in a single horizontal tier should be about the same limerick.''

''It's amazing how many WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo actually scan pretty well.  Free dinner at Swanky Frank's to the first person who can compose an entire Lim' out of WSTLS, without inventing any new ones for glue.''

    "O Kind sir, tell me: Where are you ''headed''?
        "I just tipped up my hat

    "And I thought with this ring I'd thee wedded."

    Though for me it is purely conjecture
    (And I'm never the kind who will lecture),
        Even refactored code
        Crumbles under the load

    "You aren't gonna need it," said Kent,
    "Do the simplest thing that's well meant.
        "You knit tests and code,
        "pair, measure the load,
    "(re)factor with clients present."

It's 5-7-5 all right but I couldn't think of a season word to use. Is there a HaikuMaster in the house? -- BrianEwins

JoelNeely -- I'm not a HaikuMaster, nor do I play one on a TV (Ba)sho,

Hehehe. Maybe I should start a rival page, TheHappyHaikuer or HaikuHacking. Only, limericks are (generally) funnier (except mine). Heck, at least they scan, Mr Merel...

    When good software is written by teams,
    You'll find that they go to eXtremes,
        They focus on testing
        and doing the best thing
    And YAGNI (whatever ''that'' means).
