	 :	My preference - clearly communicated to developers - is for achieving a productivity level of negative lines of code. While maintaining functionality, this always fixes bugs. -- EricUlevik

A division of AppleComputer started having developers report LinesOfCode written as a ProductivityMetric.  The guru, BillAtkinson, happened to be refactoring and tuning a graphics library at the time, and ended up with a six-fold speedup and a much smaller library.  When asked to fill in the form, he wrote in NegativeLinesOfCode.  Management got the point and stopped using those forms soon afterwards.
