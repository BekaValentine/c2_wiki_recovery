He/She should encompass three roles: a scientist, an artisan, and an artist. As a scientist, he/she pursues logics, originality, and theories. As an artisan, he/she pursues skills, unconscious competence, and mastership. As an artist, he/she pursues beauty, and aesthetics. A great talk given by RichardWesleyHamming (the inventor of the HammingCode) "You and Your Research", which is about making great achievement in research and his observations on the great scientists such as ClaudeShannon, who died recently, could be found on the internet. Recommended to every students and professionals who want to do first-class work, whatever their field might be. --JuneKim
