The general term for describing a particular family of techniques (ex. ConstructorInjection and SetterInjection) to implement the InversionOfControl pattern.  Decouple modules/components/objects from each other by having a third-party (ex. a framework like SpringFramework, PicoContainer, etc.) ''inject'' into a component (typ. under construction) appropriate instances of objects that it depends on - GeoffSobering
