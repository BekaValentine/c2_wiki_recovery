Michael's Laws:
 
(1) Patterns are no surrogate for human intuition and creativity.

(2) Overload of patterns in your software architecture implies overload of problems in your system. However, not using patterns where applicable may make your life extremely unpleasant.

(3) If you just found a pattern, think again before bothering the rest of us!

(4) Patterns are your best friends if they are treated with friendliness in your architecture design.

(5) It is easy to become a pattern author but it is surprisingly hard to write a good pattern description.

(6) Beware of Murphy's Laws when applying patterns.
