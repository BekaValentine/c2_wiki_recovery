Signs that you are letting StarTrek leak too far into your work habits:

* Replaced your Enter key with an Engage key.
* If you are in management and have to fire somebody, you say:
** "Kaaaaahn! You are fired!"
** "Our company decided not to assimilate you after all."
* Accidently keep calling attractive female coworkers "7".
** One of them understands the reference and slaps you. (Literally, or with a harassment complaint).
* "Dammit Jim, I am a programmer, not a network administrator!"
* Keep referring to your boss as "Captain".
* If your boss asks you to hurry up to reach a deadline, you say with a Scottish accent: "I'm givin' her all I've got, Captain".
** Multiply estimates by a factor of four.
* An irate user calls and you head over to visit them mumbling to yourself, "Screw 'stun', phasers on 'kill' this time."
* Refer to job interview as "first contact".
* Show up for an interview and ask the receptionist to summon "Cap'n Kirk and Mister Spock"
* Refer to the fax machine as "the paper transporter".
** Or the  "flattened sheet of carbon fibers transporter".
* Look at your paycheck and say, "There is no way in hell I'll live long and prosper".
* Refer to a CartesianJoin as "Infinite diversity in infinite combinations".
* Rig your desktop computer to throw sparks and smoke if a program crashes (see PlasmaToTheFace).
* Refer to the marketing department as "the Ferengi".
* Refer to your monitor as "the main viewer".
* Refer to files with "hidden" attribute as "cloaked".
* Refer to over-promised difficult projects as "boldly going where no man has gone before".
* Replace "Women" sign on restroom with "where no man has gone before".
* Keep saying to the coffee machine, "Tea, Earl Grey, Hot!"

* "Sorry, boss, I can't come to your office because I am out of transporter range."
* Refer to the phone as a "communicator".
* "Sorry, I can't hear you clearly on this communicator. There must be trionomic radiation on this planet." (80% of the planets they visit seem to have some kind of radiation that blocks their communication or their transporters. It is powerful enough to knock out 24th-century technology but still not fry humans devoid of space suits.)
