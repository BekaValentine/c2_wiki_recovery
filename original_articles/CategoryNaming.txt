There seems to be something almost magical about giving something the "right" name.

General names in English and other natural languages -- non-programming linguistic questions about naming people, machines, cities, countries, etc.:
* NameMagic
* NamingConqueredLands
* NamesGivenToComputers
* TipsForNamingComputers

File names and Wiki page names / page titles
* ChoosingWikiNames
* OtherWardsWikiNameSuggestions
* LinkNameIsPageName
* TooShortTooPithy
* ForthishWikiName
* LongTitlesSmell

(Is there a page on human-readable URLs somewhere, perhaps on another Wiki?)

Software names (variable names, method names, class names, etc.):
* MeaningfulName
* AreLongAndDescriptiveRelated
* VeryLongDescriptiveNamesThatProgrammingPairsThinkProvideGoodDescriptions
* NameThingsWhatYouCallThem
* MethodsWithNounNames
* RoleSuggestingVariable
* IdentifiersAreComments
* NameSpace
* IdentifierPrefix
* HungarianNotation
* UncleBobsNamingConventions

Do all three of these areas have good principles and patterns in common ? I think the idea of NameSpace can be generalized to all of them ...

EditHint: Do we need CategoryProductNaming to distinguish between object naming (e.g. variables & columns) and application, product, or device names?
