A group of people who get together and discuss patterns on a regular basis. Usually the group starts out reading DesignPatterns and then goes on to papers by people like WardAndKent.  See also, CategoryPatternsGroup.

If you've finished the GoF book try the PortlandPatternRepository for other patterns to study.
See also CategoryPattern.

See the DesignPatternsStudyGuide for a really useful suggested sequence of study for the patterns in the DesignPatterns book.
