1/18/2002 AOL is in negotiations to acquire RedHatLinux.

Could AOL be the one to help this techy-cult OS cross the chasm into the early majority?

''Wouldn't that make Linux hax0rs AOL wankers? Oh, the irony.''

RedHatLinux != Linux.  Real Linux Hackers already consider RedHatLinux users to be wankers. (And the BSD'ers consider the Real Linux Hackers to be wankers.)

''If AOL bought RedHatLinux, AOL users would be using RedHatLinux. Thus, the aura of "l33t k3rn3| hax0r" will be dulled by the thudding AOLusers. (Yes, this is a troll. Don't take it too seriously.)''

Or AOL could invest time and money in contributing to a Linux GUI which is internally consistent, not a Windows rip, and usable by mere mortals.

''The article speculates that AOL would take over the MasterBootRecord on installation and install Linux on the PC. They must have grown tired of hijacking the Windows registry, browser settings, and networking applets and decided to get closer to the metal. Gotta give 'em points for being creative.''

''I can see the AOL CDs now. Min requirements: 350 MB disk storage.''

If the new AOL installation deletes Windows first, it would have the net effect of freeing a few hundred megs...

This is disgusting! I'm sure glad I use Mandrake! If AOL owned TV networks AND a monopolistic ISP service AND a cutting-edge operating system, why then they'd be competing with MicroSoft!!!

Oh, wait a minute. That's a GoodThing. Never mind. ;-} -- PhlIp

Are we all looking forward to a deluge of RedHatLinux CDs in the mail? -- KrisJohnson

I asked my 6yo daughter what she was going to give out for Xmas and she said without hesitation "AOL CDs". --PhlIp
