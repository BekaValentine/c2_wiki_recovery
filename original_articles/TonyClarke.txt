THIS is my page.

I live in Glasgow, Scotland, by the way.

I have two kids, and a wife.

I like philosophy, animals, religions, sailing, computers. (Applemacs preferably, but hey!)

Write to me...

Hey Tony, is that dinghy or keelboat?  Have you seen http://alberg30.org/collaborate/moin.cgi?  I've  often thought wiki would be great for a general interest sailing site but I'm not a programmer. -- MarkTilley
