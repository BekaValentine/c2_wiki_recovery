Mark Crane is trying to get a PhD in Composition and Rhetoric at the University of Louisville.  He is planning to astound and amaze his colleagues by installing the WikiWeb for his students to use to write collaboratively.  


Currently, the cgi-bin directory on my main account is hammered, so I took Austin's Kwiki-clone and installed it in another account.  Now, like most Perl scripts, I've got to tweak the stuffing out of it and beg a bunch of strangers for help until it works!

The clone installation attempt (Kwiki) can be found at:

http://homer.louisville.edu/~mecran01/cgi-bin/kwiki

His class home page can be found at:

http://www.louisville.edu/~mecran01

update: 9-25-00

We're not using Wiki/Kwiki anymore.  Instead, due to the installation of new computers, we're doing more straight-up web publishing.  But Kwiki/Wiki is still the coolest and I will miss it.

[update: Mark received his Ph.D. in 2004 and is currently teaching at http://uvu.edu  He misses the good old days when a simple wiki was an amazing thing. -9/25/2012]

[update: the planet is a smoking nuclear wasteland.  I live in a bunker that used to be a genealogical archive, carved into the granite of the mountains outside SLC.  Amazed that C2 is still working -12/25/2056]

April 2nd, 2008: I am amazed and delighted that my page here still exists.  I think, but am not sure, that it was first created around 1996 or so.  Twelve years.  Now I am wistful. I am running PmWiki at http://textomatic.org/ecc
