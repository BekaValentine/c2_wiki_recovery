[ISBN 0 19 509160 4] In his introduction the author says "This is a book about a genuine paradigm shift. One that moves us beyond programming and to system design. To be honest, I do not believe that the solution I document in the book's final chapters will have much impact..."

''To be honest, I have a hard time taking seriously any book that claims to be "about a genuine paradigm shift".''

The underlying thesis of the book is that, although computing technology, in its relatively short lifetime, has impacted modern economies and cultures, our understanding of software remains rooted in our experience of precomputer technology. ... To attain the level of productivity that software makes possible, we need a new model. One such model is adaptive design. The end of all design is human satisfaction. After 50 years of computer technology it is time to reexamine the potential role of software in the advancement of human society.

The author takes the reader on a journey through philosophy of science, the relationship between science and technology, software's "unique capabilities" and ecological design, human problem solving...

The author looks at domains outside computer science for knowledge relevant to the subsequent examination of software and he spends a lot of time with the architects. He learned a lot from ChristopherAlexander 's NotesOnTheSynthesisOfForm.

I loved the book and not only because it describes an approach we try to use developing our framework with meta-repository (http://www.argo.be/OoFrame ''BrokenLink'') -- MartineDevos

Does it offer clear suggestions, or does the author need to read DontComplainWithoutAlternatives?
