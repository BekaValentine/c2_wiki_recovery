Hi! 

I am a swedish developer. Writing has always fascinated me - both doing it and thinking about how it can be done.  

For a short, happy period (1988-1990) I did most of my programming in Smalltalk. I don't use the language these days, but I still enjoy the way Smalltalk people think.  

There is a little more about me on my personal webpage: http://www.jonasbeckman.com
