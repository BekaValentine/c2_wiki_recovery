''It seems to work quite well, especially in the 3.0 version, which supports profiling the 1.3.1 JVM. However, I think I'm dissatisfied with the state of Java profiling in general, and I wonder what else is out there? So far, I haven't seen anything that was as easy to use or as helpful as the profiler that came with Borland C++ 3.1. Any Advice?'' -- RobertChurch
