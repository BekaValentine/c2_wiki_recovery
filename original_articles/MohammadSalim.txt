An old friend of mine (AlistairCockburn writing here), excellent designer, thinker and manager. Goes by the name Mho (no accident this is ohm spelled backwards). Used to live in Salt Lake City, now in Boulder, CO.  Lots of good quotes from this man, ...

MhosQuote about management and energy.

Spends most of his free time rafting down various whitewater rivers for days or weeks at a time, or drumming to the full moon in the mountains.
