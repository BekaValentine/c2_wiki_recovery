I'm a software developer in Hamburg, Germany, who is still dreaming of the perfect ExtremeProgramming-team... ;-)

Meanwhile I focus on agile Java development, suitable technologies (currently Spring framework) and PHP development.

You can find more information and contact me on http://www.sebastian-eichner.de

I usually join the meetings of the HamburgXpUsersGroup.
