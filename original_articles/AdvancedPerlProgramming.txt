ISBN 1-56592-220-4 ''I've read the CamelBook and EffectivePerlProgramming, but I'm also getting a lot that I don't think is in the above from Sriram Srinivasam's AdvancedPerlProgramming. Regrettably full of errata and with a code style that seem ignorant of a lot of EffectivePerlProgramming, it's still a great way to learn about the libraries and guts of Perl.'' --PeterMerel
