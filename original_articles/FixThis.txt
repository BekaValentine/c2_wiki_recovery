As when paired with:
* BrokenLink
* EditHint
* ...

It is used when at first-step (discovery of need) a hint of fixing seems possible, given time, skill, and effort.

It is interesting to look at the backlinks to BrokenLink, which has about 500 entries.  I have just fixed some on ZopeApplicationServer as it was the last in the alphabet. There must be a lot of pages where factual information from ten years ago is now outdated. -- JohnFletcher
