According to the bio in the back of SinAndSyntax,Constance Hale spent her childhood in Hawaii, messing around in the kapakahi syntax of pidgin English. She went on to study English lit. at Princeton University and to earn a master's degree in journalism at U.C. Berkley. After newspapering for a few years, she landed at Wired, where she dabbled in old and new media and wrote Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. She continues to work in print and online, and teaches writing and grammar to grown-ups. Hale lives in Oakland, California with a guy named Bruce and a dog named Homer (after the Greek poet, not Bart Simpson's father!).
