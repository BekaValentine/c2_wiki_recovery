I'm more of a reader than a writer, but I try to contribute now and then.

My M.Sc. work is at ftp://ftp.cs.ualberta.ca/pub/TechReports/1996/TR96-26 - during the course of which I had the pleasure of meeting and having lunch with WardCunningham.   No doubt in my mind that meeting involved an asymmetric exchange of ideas (thanks Ward).
