JustaProgrammer

Software and hardware developer, working since high school (1977) on pretty much everything. I've written user interfaces. I've written compilers. I've helped debug early TCP/IP implementations. I've designed digital hardware from microprocessors to high-speed network interfaces using ECL to Programmable Logic Devices. I wrote Perl programs to crunch the Ada code from the Air Traffic Control system for the country of Belgium and generate 100,000 web pages of cross-references as a programming tool. Working since 1995 almost exclusively on web applications, mostly in Java and Perl (with a fair bit done in ASP, PHP, etc.) I've written as much HTML as most user interface designers (and the user interface developers regularly ask me questions about HTML).

But more importantly, I have a wife and two kids (one adopted from China), play stand-up bass and sing in a bluegrass band, study and teach Latin and ancient Greek, and read the Bible (not necessarily all at once). And I love the Three Stooges and all kinds of sports, especially rugby and cricket.
