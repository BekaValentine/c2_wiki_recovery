Even as BrainsAsaCheapCommodity, the commodity still has value. And therefore HealthyBodyAndMind practices are important to WikiCommunity.

* Note Body comes before Mind, even though the Mind is the more precious commodity.
** Okay, I give up. This is a quaint riddle of some kind, right? I always thought a good, productive, contributing person of compromised health was more valuable than an antisocial, destructive, parasitic person in perfect health. So, body comes before mind ... because ... ?
*** Because a valuable Mind is only useful as long as the Body stays alive. This is something of a ChickenAndEggProblem in a sense, but we can take the easy way out by presupposing that the Mind starts out as pretty decent. Enabling the Mind activity requires a functional Body, and neglecting the Body overmuch can lead to the inability to use the Mind - either by disease or death. As my father was very fond of reminding me, one's skills are only useful if they are being used.

''Cholesterol management''

"National Cholesterol Education Program" has been around since 1985 (see http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/ncep/), and yet lots of people today have high levels of bad cholesterol (see WikiPedia entry at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol).
* Perhaps we need something simple so lay people can know both the risks (two sudden deaths of young people got my attention in the past week), and means to controlling its level (e.g. if I put myself on zero cholesterol diet how quickly will my cholesterol level drop?).
* meanwhile the best I can offer is the American heart foundation link at http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=1516

'''UnitTest for the body'''

Frequent bloodtests for whiteblood cell counts (cancer), blood sugar (diabetes that can cause limb loss / blindness etc.), chlorestorol, etc.

But that may not work for lung cancer, see Peter Jennings story at http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/index.php?page=local&story_id=080905a3_lungcancer
* Moral is not to press your luck with smoking. Even though some celebrities live to over 90 year old, six months is what lots of other people have, from detection to the grave yard. More about smoking and cancer at http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1092120,00.html
