A runner. A writer. A cute boyfriend. Sweet.

Writes in a frighteningly banterful manner. (http://216.119.110.112/me/index.shtml)

Also known as 'GH'.

Programs in CeePlusPlus. Writes in English. Sings off-key.

(He also knows how uncool it is to claim C++ as a virtue ( It's at best a mediocrity ), and thus is learning other ProgrammingLanguage''''''s.)

Thought up this story:

Some friends started a band once.  Johnny sang. Billy rattled his guitar. 
Tommy banged his drums. Johnny was cute, and Billy made intense expressions while he strummed. The band got pretty popular.  They started making albums with the help of a local recording studio. Everyone was happy with the band's rising fortunes.

And then Tommy got replaced by a drum machine. 

La, such is automation in the workplace.  

But AutomationIsOurFriend one might say. 

AutomationIsNotOurFriend if it replaces friends.
