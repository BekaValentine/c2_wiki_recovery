Elements of WikiEssence:
* Simple markups for formatting instead of HTML (see TipsForBeginners and TextFormattingRules)
* No markups for links (pages, external links, images, ...)
* content is basically ego-less and time-less (it's not considered important who wrote it and when it was written)
* Hyperlinks appear when referred to (no need to create them).
* Encourages creation of hyperlinks, and always shows which ones are valid. (Showing dead links with '?' really encourages creative WordPlay.)
* RecentChanges (see also ForgetfulnessAsFilter)
* Loss of history (some wikis add a page history)
* Flat namespace (some wikis allow subpages or hierarchies)

Accidents of Wiki implementation:
* Wiki links being resolved by a CGI script.
* Wiki pages being stored
** in the OS file system
** in a database
** as intranet wikis (or CorporateWikis)
** as wikis without public access (http://www.wiki.org)
** as Read Only Wikis
