CRC card designs are tested by running 
challenging scenarios against them.  
A scenario so applied might be called an AbuseCase
to distinguish it from the UseCase suggested by 
IvarJacobson.

An abuse case is an artifact of design, not requirements
analysis.  It starts when it needs to start and runs until
the objects within a system have been shown able to withstand
an abuse.  An abuse case may have nothing to do with 
a user.  PowerFailure and MemoryExhaustion are typical 
abuse cases as are AmbiguousInput and ConflictingPolicy.

	* Use a UseCase to define a requirement of a system.  
	* Use an AbuseCase to test the flexibility of a framework.
