Sprint Review meeting (also known as Demo Meeting or ShowCase meeting) is done at the end of the Sprint, usually on the last sprint day. During this meeting, all committed user stories are presented to Product Owner. No slides are allowed. Team should "Show" software working. It could be managed by one person or by different team members. Each user story is shown at a time, product owner decides if the story is meeting the expectations or it's not.

At the end of the Showcase, team is able to get Velocity* from the stories accepted by product. For the stories not accepted they will pass once again to Product Backlog to be reconsidered in a further sprint.
