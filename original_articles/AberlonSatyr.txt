This is apparently the guestbook entry for one Aberlon Satyr.

He is somewhat confused by the ... 'attitude' of the Wiki - it seems almost like Kibo, in a way. Zope is stranger and more complex, but has a less mystical approach to it's ... documentation?

He likes the idea of such ... volatile internal hyperlinks, however. If only permissions could be set, his homepage would be a Wiki.
