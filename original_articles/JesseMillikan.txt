Young, professional programmer without a college degree, from central Indiana. I ran into the wiki a few times over the last few years, and finally settled down and read a bunch of it. I contribute when I have something semi-relevant to add, which is almost never.If I've wondered into totally irrelevant territory, feel free to delete it...

http://github.com/jmillikan/Yet-Another-Juggling-Animator

Any jugglers on the wiki? I'm working on a little open pattern animator. Passing patterns (and the list of jugglers doing them) can be built as Scheme lists using some very high-level functions provided. It's beginning to be more of a pitiful animator with lots of juggling primitives than anything else.

I juggle on Sundays and Thursdays with the Circle City Jugglers (http://www.circlecityjugglers.com) if you ever want to hunt me down IRL. You may be forced to ride a RollaBolla before challenging me to mortal combat.

I'm sort of an entrepreneur now! (http://www.weddingmusicproject.com not much there yet) Little 3-man thing that probably won't make money. Using NearlyFreeSpeech for hosting, trying to find a blog platform that supports Sqlite (any suggestions?) and we're basically just obsessing over SEO while my dad makes music. Also, I'm a really questionable designer :) See above. Getting better fast. My colors of choice in web design are black, red and white, same as for juggling clubs, shirts, food packaging, and everything else. I'm such a great artist! As long as you don't want me to use blue because I will say '''no''' and find an adult.

I have contributed to EverythingTwo (as 'quamaretto') and WikiPedia, largely on programming matters. I participate in SphereOnlineJudge and GreatComputerLanguageShootout.

Also, I've started to see edits made under my name, so for the time being I'm going to un-set my UserName. (3/3/2008)

Everything2 nodes of interest would be 
* http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=infinite%20loop - In the spirit of CategoryInManyProgrammingLanguages, a big collection of infinite loops and recursions with build/run instructions
** ''Nice! On EverythingTwo, only the author gets to edit their content? If so, I've got some code for you to add. --IanOsgood''
** Thanks! I've already got two Befunge examples that, as you've said, don't have '@' :). The trouble is that I really wanted to have build/run instructions for each; non-working examples drive me nuts. I'll pull these in as soon as I get them to build or get over my anal-retentiveness.
*** BefungeLanguage 0: ''any'' program without the halt command '@' (including the empty program) will run forever (barring stack overflow or div 0), because the code space wraps around.
*** BrainfuckLanguage: '''+[]'''
*** FalseLanguage: '''1[$][]#'''
*** ForthLanguage 1: ''': F BEGIN AGAIN ; F'''
*** ForthLanguage 2 (stack overflow): ''': F RECURSE ; F'''
*** SnuspLanguage: two dimensional, so this is preformatted

* http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=GTKYN - An odd problem with E2 that obscures major topics

I'm highly excitable about ''''''ProgrammingLanguage''''''s and paradigms. By career, I do alot of CeeSharp and AspDotNet, with JavaScript and HTML and so forth. My worst vice is probably briefly screwing around with a language and never mastering any. At this point, I've messed around with (at least):

CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, PythonLanguage, RubyLanguage, PerlLanguage, SchemeLanguage, CommonLisp, JayLanguage, ToolCommandLanguage, SmalltalkLanguage, AplusLanguage, CeeSharp, JavaLanguage, OcamlLanguage, ErlangLanguage, AwkLanguage,  DeeCee, WhitespaceLanguage, UnixShell, OzLanguage, AssemblyLanguage, JavaScript, VbScript, AutoLisp, EmacsLisp, VbClassic, SqlServer, and probably some things I'm forgetting.

See blog at http://jmillikan.blogspot.com for occasional rants.

ToDoList:
*PerlConstructorStrawMan - The WhyHatePerl bit here, and any other relevant bits in PythonVsPerl
*Figure out a proper antipattern description of the Photoshop "requirements" comments in LeadingRequest
*Contribute some examples to CategoryInManyProgrammingLanguages
*Fix/implement the AntiPatternTemplate in ArchitectsDontCode, WolfTicket and others
** Added some real content to WolfTicket awhile back
** Did ArchitectsDontCode with template
** Did FearOfSuccess with template
** Really yell at me if you think I screwed these up, or fix up the page yourself. I realize the writing is pretty dry.

I've started viewing at 5 inches wide with .2 inch margins for easier reading. I use the "Stylish" FireFox plugin with this CSS:
 @-moz-document url-prefix(http://c2.com) {
 div#wiki { max-width: 5in }
 body { padding: .2in }
 }
 @-moz-document url-prefix(http://www.c2.com) {
 div#wiki { max-width: 5in }
 body { padding: .2in }
 }

''Hi, Jesse. Nice to see another Stylish user! You can simplify your c2 hack with the following. It takes care of both c2.com and www.c2.com, so that you DontRepeatYourself. It tried it just now:''
 @-moz-document domain("c2.com") {
 div#wiki { max-width: 5in }
 body { padding: .2in }
 }
''A nice alternative for readability is div#wiki { max-width: 30em }. This provides a line length of around 12 words no matter what the font size. -- ElizabethWiethoff''

30em is exactly what I tried first! I decided that I wanted it to stay the same across font sizes and faces, for some reason, so I went with inches instead. Same result, since I never change font sizes.

''Great minds think (almost) alike.''
