Tom's philosophy:  QuestionAuthority.  Don't make a baseless claim: test it, benchmark it, prove it. Most claims written (about Oracle) by "experts" are wrong, unless they provide the code, logs and/or trace files.	He suggests that most performance failures start with developers that treat databases as a black box.  Why not learn what it can do for you instead?

Take a gander at his stuff, it really can teach you a lot about OracleDatabase''''''s.
