The following seems to be all that's needed for the future of Wiki. I'm talking to anonymous, as seems usual. Some of the older stuff may eventually be put in http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WhyIsNowClosedOnWiki.

''Is it time to restart the C2 JesusChrist page?'' http://web.archive.org/web/20010723193710/http://clublet.com/c/c/why?JesusChrist

As I said to Ward in my email of late November when Why first closed, at least WhyClublet will serve as a cautionary tale to anyone trying to do extended, bad-tempered discussion of Christianity on Wiki. I think the implications should be pretty clear to everyone if the brief history remains recorded here. -- RichardDrake

''I suggest using http://andstuff.org/JesusChrist.'' http://web.archive.org/web/20030428212709/http://andstuff.org/JesusChrist

Brilliant. We wish the idea well on Scott's wiki [''since closed''] and on every other one. Not many fora seem able to cope intelligently with TheChallengeOfJesus http://web.archive.org/web/20030510230723/http://clublet.com/c/c/why?TheChallengeOfJesus as TomWright calls it - a ubiquitous Why referent who has just been named the new BishopOfDurham. http://web.archive.org/web/20070616014953/http://clublet.com/c/c/why?BishopOfDurham

As a regular here, I was extremely sorry to see Wiki explode into such low quality ranting about Jesus in the middle of 2000 after TheVisitation. As it turned out ranting without responsibility led inexorably to WhyClublet and I believe deeply influenced the ethos of the new forum, very much for the worse.

I got involved in all this only because of my NearDeathExperience in the summer of 2000. It proved rather catching. In 2003, I'm taking time to think through WhyWouldOneBother trying to host such a thing for the first two years. That may give some pointers to the future. WhyWouldOneBother also renders publicly for the first time Ward's original email asking me to move "all wiki pages devoted to Christian topics" from Wiki, for the benefit of WikiHistory. -- RichardDrake

'''Question'''

This page has existed for a long time, but it does nothing to explain the current situation. I mean, how can Why be closed when it's ''right there''?

''It's closed because it's impossible to edit it. It's no longer a public site, just a private site. Editing is by membership only and you have to ''apply'' and be ''accepted'' to be able to, say, copy your own damned content off Why!!''

There are big issues with what anyone might mean by "your own damned content", of course. But I have indicated to anyone that asks that I will allow people known to have been key contributors in to copy stuff out, if that is what they want.

But I note again Wiki's propensity to go anonymous when things get difficult in this way, both question and answer. Exactly the opposite of how it should be, in my view. But that may well be the difference between a RealNamesWiki and a FullResponsibilityWiki. -- RichardDrake

Would it be possible to open to the public on a '''read-only''' basis? Some topics, such as ChineseRoom, have reference links to them.

Open or closed, it is now pretty much dead. -- JohnDuncan
