A rich hypertext facility used in SGML (StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage) documents. XLink is to HyTime as XML is to SGML.

From http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/hytimeKimber9701.html :

"HyTime is an application of SGML: to oversimplify, HyTime defines a set of
element types that you can use with your existing SGML document types to
provide hyperlinking and other facilities in a standardized way.

In other words, HyTime effectively extends SGML by defining a standard set
of facilities for doing hypertext and multimedia presentations.  

HyTime does not compete with or change SGML in any way--it simply builds on
the basic facilities SGML provides.  In particular, HyTime provides the
following hypertext-related facilities:

	1. A general model of hyperlinks and syntax for hyperlink representation using SGML elements.  This is much more than simple ID/IDREF.
	2. Facilities for addressing things other than elements with IDs in the local document: cross-document ID refs, references to elements without IDs, references to data characters,references to multiple objects at once.

These are facilities that all hypertext applications need.  HyTime provides
a general and robust mechanism for adding them to SGML documents and SGML
processing applications.  HyTime can also be integrated with other
mechanisms, such as TEI extended pointers or HTTP URLs."
