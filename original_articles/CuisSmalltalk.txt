Cuis is a SqueakSmalltalk fork, with a focus on reducing system complexity.

http://cuis-smalltalk.org/

Some highlights by the main developer, taken from his web site:

''Some of the main ideas and objectives for Cuis are:

*Close to the ideas in Smalltalk-80 and "Design Principles Behind Smalltalk".
*Includes only kernel functionality + dev tools.
*Included code should be of high quality.
*Includes a greatly simplified and enhaned Morphic as the main UI.
*Easy to fix and extend.
*Reasonably stable. Smalltalk kernel should not change much.''
