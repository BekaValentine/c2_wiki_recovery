Does anyone know anything about this?

How would it differ from plain old LeaderShip?  --RandyStafford

One man embodies ExtremeLeadership more than any I can think of: GeorgePatton.

Some examples from ''Patton on Leadership : Strategic Lessons for Corporate Warfare'' [ISBN: 0735200912]
* Command and Management
** Any man who thinks he is indispensable, ain't.
** People must have authority to match responsibility.
** Commanders must command.
* Health
** An active mind cannot exist in an inactive body.
** Always make the mind command the body.
** To gain strength, always go beyond exhaustion.
* Pride and Confidence
** Pride in self starts with pride in appearance.
** Do not be afraid to fail.
** Never take counsel of your fears.
* Decision Making
** Grab 'em by the nose and kick 'em in the pants!
** If everyone is thinking alike, no one is thinking.
** In the long run, it is what we do not say that will destroy us.
* Victory and Success
** The way to win is to never lose!
** Never fight a battle unless you will gain by winning.
** Success is not getting on top; it's how you bounce off the bottom.
* Life and Death
** Death can be more exciting than life.
** Live for something rather than die for nothing.
** Fear kills more people than death.

These are great and inspiring words. Having been in the military, I can relate to, and have been trained to live by, many of these priciples. But I'd offer a few words of advice to those who would attempt to lead an XP team with these principles (I'm assuming that is what's suggested with the Extreme prefix). 

Most Software types chose their profession as an alternative to military, hierarchical structures. Attempts to introduce a healthier lifestyle are often met with resentment. An effective leader in XP must subordinate themselves to the group and encourage acceptance of responsibility rather than delegate it. Patton's subordinates couldn't leave if they grew tired of his philosophy. He had authoritative power. Effective XP requires referential or expert power. 

But there is a lot to be said for software developed using a military-like philosophy. Siebel is a good example of a successful company that very closely adheres to the above mentioned principles.
