''Information Exclusion is the shielding of a user from the presentation of unwanted information or executions.''

It is not InformationHiding, but rather the total exclusion of information the user has deemed unwanted. 

Utilizing this method in the execution of a program should be placed under the control of the '''user''' of Information. 
* Examples: 
** Spam Filters
**Content Filters
** Address Filters
** Word Filters
** and other such devices
* The program which presents the unwanted information must include the mechanism for ''total exclusion'' which might have been included via the objectional information of 
** any presentation
** images
** cookies 

When I hit a site by mistyping a reference, I was deluged when a page came up containing objectionable content, and if that wasn't enough, up popped another and another unwanted window. Every time any attempt was made to stop or remove a page, another page or series of pages appeared. When the episode was over, I had to go to over 8 or 10 different locations in my computer to remove pages, images and cookies which had been stored. Many people do not have the expertise to do this and so a result, there will be unwanted residual files stored. 

A method of Information Exclusion should be built in to the browser which will allow the selection and exclusion, item by item, or all of the pages which are displayed and have been displayed on the computer for as long as the history is maintained on the computer. 

The exclusion should include the deletion of temporary files, cookies, images and other files which might have been stored as a result of the browser's actions. This is in keeping with a PoliteInterface, which should be the mode under which any user interface operates on a personal computer.
