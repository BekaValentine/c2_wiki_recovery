This lies mainly in having to cope with a somewhat arbitrary and unnecessarily complicated system of rules and restrictions (especially the latter).

The difficulty of programming is that one is trying to emulate a fuzzy (as in fuzzy logic), adaptive human based process using a fixed, boolean mechanism.  In a human process, people adjust and adapt the rules to fit particular contexts.  In a software program, the rules are frozen at deployment and the user must find the particular program rule that best fits his situation.

My two bits' worth: the main cause of difficulty in programming is the inappropriateness of the tools we have to work with.  Digging a ditch is hard if all you have to work with is a spoon and fork!  --PaulMorrison
