I like Taoism but don't understand Buddhism. I wish I was more effective at incorporating it within myself. 

I don't know how I first became interested in patterns. I'm always looking for better ways. More understanding. I found Wiki to be wonderful. So non-linear. (Apparently) non-confrontational. I hope to contribute to the communal story.

I'm trying out a sort of pattern idea called MuddyDecomposition.
