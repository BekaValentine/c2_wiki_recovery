WeCanStopSpam.org was a vqwiki (another type of WikiWikiWeb) about an innovative community-based approach to stopping spam, based on people adding a simple link to the end of their emails. Details were at '''www.wecanstopspam.org''', but that has now been hijacked by spamdexer as of 2005-02-21.

'''Don't go there!''' You are only helping the spammer if you do so. The spammer is now benefitting from the PageRank the antispam was able to build up through links.  Spammers shouldn't benefit from this, please remove links to this site if you find them.  I have done so here.

The 'simple link' mentioned is ''Help free our mailboxes. Include h''''''ttp:// wecanstopspam.org in your signature.''

Interesting, I wonder if that could work. Can't hurt to try I guess.

''What's to stop spammers from including the signature in their delightful little missives?''

Nothing.  The idea is that in this case they are giving people a reference to an anti-spam site, which provides tools and ideas for stopping spam.

http://www.habeas.com/ have a similar idea, with one difference.  The text to be added to legitimate email is copyrighted, with a license for use that basically says "you can copy this on any email that isn't spam."  So, if a spammer uses it, they're vulnerable to legal action ... if you can get at them.
