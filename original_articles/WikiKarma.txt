No, nothing like SlashDot's moderation system; more like this:

	 :	We're all trying to keep this place full of rich content, while also keeping it nice and tidy.

Every time you commit a feat of refactoring or create a page with stunning content, you can indulge yourself by making a few small messes. Go ahead, make that "Me, too." comment you've been dying to make - you deserve it.

Don't forget, though, that the unhappy inverse is also true. If you make some messes, atone for them. FixYourWiki so your Wiki won't fix you.
