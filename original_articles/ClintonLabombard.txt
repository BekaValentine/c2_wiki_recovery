I am an evolved hybrid of ancient yeti, screaming savage, and butt-probing star ape.  I like meat and stir-fried veggies and have been known to ingest the squeezed juices of both.  I am sometimes known to roam the barren fiery wastes of northern Texas, but prefer to stay in my dingy cave, glowering at a brightly lit square of plastics.  My technical specialties include web design, web programming including DHTML and PHP/MySQL, and usability.
