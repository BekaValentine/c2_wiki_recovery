''From the web page...''

The current state of the web is strongly biased towards reading previously authored documents. Changes and additions to the page are solely the purview of the original author. Sparrow promotes a different genre of web page: the community-shared page. Like any web page, a community-shared page is originally crafted by a single author, who defines the initial content and scope of the document. But unlike other web pages, a community-shared page can be modified or added to by any interested contributor, and the barriers for doing so are lessened by allowing changes to be made in a lightweight manner. Community-shared pages increase the collaborative capability of the web.

After a quick look, Sparrow looks quite interesting, but also more complex than
a Wiki Wiki. It's not publicly released (yet), but you can see examples at the
web site. -- LairdPopkin

Bay's an old friend from my Stanford days. He's been known to do some pretty cool stuff. Be sure to check out Seity(http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/members/bchang/seity), a result of his doctoral work. -- JohnVlissides
