A WikiPage, that doesn't exist (yet). I.e. words in CamelCase, that have a trainling "?" to indicate that there is NoWikiPage for the WIkiWord yet.

Could be used as a WikiBadge to indicate places, where a WikiWord is not because of
*Wrong spelling
*Page expected to exist doesn't
*Topic exists, but just not this WikiWord
