PyLinda - Distributed Computing Made Easy

Introduction

Linda is an widely studied distributed computing environment, centered around the notion of a TupleSpace. A tuple space is a bag (also called a multi-set) of tuples. A tuple is an ordered, typed chunk of data. TupleSpace''''''s exist independently of processes in the system, and the data placed into a tuple space also exist independently. See "Generative communication in Linda" (1985) and "Multiple tuple spaces in Linda" both by David Gelernter for more information on Linda.

PyLinda is a simple implementation of a Linda system, however it also includes several of the more recently proposed extensions to Linda in the form of multiple tuple spaces, GarbageCollection, sane non-blocking primitives and bulk tuple operations
