This document refers to an older specification for FuseDocs.  The new FuseDoc definitions are created in an XML format.

Fusedoc is a program definition language (PDL) that tells a coder what the fuse needs to do. It has (at least) three sections: PROPERTIES (a free-form set of name/value pairs), RESPONSIBILITIES (a natural language explanation of WHAT the fuse needs to accomplish), and ATTRIBUTES, those variables that are either required by the fuse or that the fuse is required to set. 

A sample Fusedoc:

<!---
|| BEGIN FUSEDOC ||

|| Title ||
Undefined
	
|| Properties ||
Name: qryValidateLogin.cfm
Author: hal.helms@TeamAllaire.com

|| Responsibilities ||

I try to find matching records for "userName" and "password". If I find any, I return to XFA.onSuccessfulLogin; else I return to the fusebox with XFA.onFailedLogin.

|| Attributes ||

--> XFA.onSuccessfulLogin: a FUSEACTION
--> XFA.onFailedLogin: a FUSEACTION

--> userName: a STRING
--> password: a STRING

++> request.DSN: an ODBC datasource

|| END FUSEDOC ||--->
