QompVandal is a bot or human (or both) that goes around repairing all CeeLanguage, ModulaLanguage, OberonLanguage, and PascalLanguage code into QompLanguage.

* I would suggest out of courtesy that you leave the original language in place and add your sample after it.

For example if we see this hideous nonsense on a page:
  USES
    someLongUnitName;

  PROCEDURE someThing;
  BEGIN someLongUnitName.writeLn('Hello World');
  END;
Or if we see a rotten corpse with flies and insect body pieces stored in the code:
  # include crap.h
  # include non_modular_crap.h
  # include other_non_modular_crap.inc

  void somelongnamespace_something()
  {
          printf("Hello World\n");
  }
It gets replaced with the proper form:

  '''use'''
    u = somelongunit;

  '''prc''' some-thing;
  '''b''' 
    u.outln('Hello World');
  '''e''';
This bot does not yet exist yet however it was a creative idea based on GrammarVandal.

''Uhhhh.....scratching head.''

{Indeed. GrammarVandal is not the person/thing to emulate. AnarchyDoesNotScale}
