I currently work for IBM Global Services in the UK.  Since joining I have worked on the Smalltalk project described further under GemStone and a conventional large Smalltalk/CICs/Cobol utilities project. I also do C++ when needs must. 

Previous Smalltalk experiences were in the telecommunications industries (transmission not billing!). 

Current professional interests are Squeak[1], Self[2] and organisational / team dynamics - how can people who think very differently work together?

Personal interests include the philosophy of mind (Owen Barfield, Rudolph Steiner etc), fine art (pictures!) and getting stock options in some whizzy high-tech start-up!
