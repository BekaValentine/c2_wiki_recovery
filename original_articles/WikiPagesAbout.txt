''A way of indicating a PageSeries by starting the PageName with '''WikiPagesAbout ''

Pardon me, but isn't that what Categories are for? Is this Yet Another Attempt to Categorize Wiki? Do we really need another such mechanism? How about if we compose pages and then organize them on a single reference page? Why try to introduce Yet Another Organizational Mechanism that will fall out of maintenance?
