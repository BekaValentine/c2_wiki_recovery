I develop software for a living. I'm not JustaProgrammer, but I like programming.

I like programming in CeePlusPlus and prefer it to other languages I've used, but will enter any LanguagePissingMatch at any time.

I've helped found a software label called Quantum Clockwork (http://www.quantumclockwork.net). We develop applications and games for PalmOs and MicrosoftWindows.

I am relatively new to WikiWikiWeb and it reminds me of the Hackers Dictionary / JargonFile but with more content and a more dynamic atmosphere. It seems to recapture the mood of UseNet in the pre-WorldWideWeb InterNet.


My email address is jason(at)quantumclockwork.net (please excuse spam-deterrent address).
