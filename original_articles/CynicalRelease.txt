Software developers often get cynical at various points in the day. It may be due to social factors, a really insidious bug, malice towards certain corporations, or a host of other factors.

What can software developers do to release that cynicism in a productive and helpful manner?

Some possibilities:
* First try to remove the cause of the cynicism, if that doesn't work. . .then:
* Rant on wiki (is it possible to do so productively?)
* Exercise until exhaustion
* Appication of pelleted lead at high velocity...''or is that cynical itself?''
* Go into the BigBlueRoom and scream your disappointment in the universe at the ceiling.
* . . . ?

''Not to be confused with a cynical release of software - which would cause a greater need for a release of cynicism''

Why employ cynicism at all? Since cynicism is counter-productive, the only release which makes sense at all is the release of cynicism as an occupation of time, energy and focus. Cynicism is rooted in unbelief, either in where one has navigated oneself to, as in working at the wrong job or at the wrong place. If one can not believe in ones own ability to contribute toward a worthy goal, such cynicism can only increase. 

CynicalRelease is based, whether it is individual or focused on unworthy or ineffective software, on disbelief. Cyncism can only be replaced, not released. Ranting, wearing oneself out in physical exertion, trap shooting, screaming, are all artificial remedies to the fundamental disbelief which will return with real activities and pursuits. We can learn that treatment of symptoms is not treatment of illness. One must remove the ill to be well.
-- DonaldNoyes

''Nice theory, but what about the case where the ill cannot be removed? One must have techniques for dealing with the inevitable cynicism.''

'''Cynicism is never inevitable!''' 

What you have in that case is not cynicism but grief, one can only cope with the attendant grief. -- DonaldNoyes

That seems like a matter of semantics. . . So what would be the techniques for dealing with attendant grief? 
* Not semantics, a separate subject, dealt with in another way, you cannot release or ignore such a matter, you usually need the help and understanding of a caring knowledgeable professional.... 

'''First recognise that cynicism is not inevitable...'''  Two questions should always spring to mind:  Why is this happening this time (now)?  How can this be avoided next time (in the future)?  The reason for this is that cynicism is the product of the critical faculty.  By using the critical faculties constructively, they are less available for use (self-)destructively, the product of which is cynicism.  In the event that you ultimately reach the conclusion that nothing could have been or can be done, that it is beyond even your critical faculties to conceive of any solution or palliative, you should have become bored by the exercise.  '''Boredom always precedes cynicism; so stop when you're bored.'''  If you must, accept that there is nothing you can do ''now'' except return to the task at hand, refreshed and reinvigorated by the interesting diversion.  

Good points - but humans are imperfect and often don't know the source of the cynicism - they just realize they feel cynical. At such times it may be less stressful to just find a release than trying to find a cause, especially when there is no guarantee that one can. 
It seems that you are using only one definition of cynicism, and there is more than one.
To adhere to a principal and not wanting it to change is not a negative but a positive, and it is a shame that most people view a cynic as a negative person and this is not always the case.

I do see your point though:
* If you can identify the source of the cynicism, then realize cynicism isn't inevitable. It is often a result of perspective, boredom, or frustration. Try viewing it differently, finding a different task, or remove the source if possible
* If one can't identify the source, then. . . ???? ''this is where things are a little hazy''  '''Looking for the source is itself the antidote to cynicism:  looking, not finding.  If, having looked, you have not found, you will be at worst disappointed (possibly desperately), but at least released from cynicism.  Perhaps you're looking for DisappointmentRelease?'''

Either you have a calming manner or you are right (or <he said grudgingly> both) - it seems that debating the nature of cynicism, is itself, a cynicism release.

'''A bit of both, thanks.  Plus oodles of empathy...'''
