I have worked as Software Developer for 12 years. I am currently working in Melbourne, Australia. My main experience is with C++, C# languages, building rich client applications on Windows and Unix platforms. I am married to a lovely girl named Laureey. We have a beautiful daughter Nerissa.

I first started getting interested in ExtremeProgramming and AgileMethodologies in 2003. Since then I have endeavored to change my processes to be as agile as possible. Unfortunately my current team and work place is not as enthusiastic about ExtremeProgramming as I am, which means that I often need to be creative in my agility.

I have belonged to the MelbourneExtremeProgrammingEnthusiastsGroup and the MelbournePatternsGroup for several years.
