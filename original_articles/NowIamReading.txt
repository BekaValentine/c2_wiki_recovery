What are the WikiZens reading right now? If you are curious, click on the title of this page and see who is reading what.

If you want to tell the other WikiZens what you are reading, put a link to this page in your homepage, with the name of the book, the ISBN code and, if you want, a link to the BookShelved wiki.

''Interesting idea, but it seems like a lot of trouble on this wiki, compared to very little trouble on BookShelved.  Assuming the page refers only to books, not wiki pages .. are we gonna need it?''

Well, I found lots of interesting books (SW Engineering related or not) just reading the homepages of the wikizens, so I think it would be useful.
