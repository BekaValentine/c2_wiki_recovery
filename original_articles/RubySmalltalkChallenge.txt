The challenge is simple: in RubyLanguage, implement a DomainSpecificLanguage that conforms to SmalltalkLanguage's OperatorPrecedence. Or in ST, implement a DSL that conforms to Ruby's operator precedence. Whichever language requires the larger amount of code to do so probably has the less flexible notation.

Can please a SmugLispWeenie stop this stupid challenge?

''Why bother? It's too vague to even get started.'' :)

Its moot now, anyway. There's OMeta for Smalltalk, and if there isn't OMeta for Ruby, there should be. Problem solved.
