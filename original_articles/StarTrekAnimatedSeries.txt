Yes, there were actually a couple of seasons of a StarTrek animated series in the Seventies. It was actually reasonably good.

	 :	Reasonably good?  Watch them again, it was terrible!  But a fun view regardless.  Terrible animation, even more ridiculous stories than StarTrekOriginalSeries...

I liked the Lioness telecom officer... ''*Growrrrr''

One of the episodes, "The Slaver Weapon," is adapted from the story "The Soft Weapon" by LarryNiven.

For what it's worth (i.e. for Trekkies who care about such things), the animated series is not considered "canon"--i.e. it never happened.  (Or, it never ''will'' happen).  It's just fiction, unlike that episode of TNG where the Enterprise crew are turned into children--that ''is'' canon, and thus an integral part of the Star Trek universe.
