The only American-born member of the MontyPython acting troupe. Has since gained a British citizenship and rejected his American one for financial reasons and in protest of GeorgeBushJunior. His major role in the Pythons was animation, but outside the group he has made some films, like the BrazilFilm (not to be confused with the book BoysFromBrazil by BeeEffSkinner, though both are dystopian to some extent).
