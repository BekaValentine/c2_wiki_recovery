When faced with a problem, a strategy we accuse PointyHairedBoss(s) of following:

* SomethingMustBeDone.
* Here's Something.
* So lets do it.

Examples of Somethings: hire more coders
(when the project is in time trouble), rewrite everything in java,
hold a workshop, avoid eye contact with the customer. Add Somethings
you've seen below, it beats banging your head on the wall. 

* make it harder to delete stuff from wiki ''yes! in fact we should make it much more socially acceptable - has anybody bothered to comment yet on RefactorFasterDeleteMore?''
* cancel all project-related travel ''or''
* let's fly everyone to Phoenix for a week
* let's waste our lives writing stupid documentation!
* "Everyone stop working!  We need to have a bunch of really long time-consuming meetings about our lack of adequate progress."  ''(Actually, this can be a very healthy response, if done properly.)''
* "Work smarter, not harder," words to live by from the second most clueless manager I have ever worked for

This also happens in democracies: There ought to be a law.
