Like UnLambdaLanguage evrything is a function, insted this is evrything objects.

The program file is a object definisen for main object. Example:
 [x=#65;xx=+out;xx=+out;]
print out "A" 2 times

I hav to complete this document, and make a interpreter for it as well. And I made a mistake abuve now I fix it

----

''Is this language defined anywhere?''

----

OK, here I will now:

Commands:
varname=value; to setvariable
==value; to set return value from +value
~ to forget 1 from calling stack

Operaters:
+value to make copy uv a object and return the ==value inside the codeing for that object
[code] to make a new object with this code and no variables. This code will not execute rite away, but will execute wen +value call copy uv it
. to get self variable
object>varname to get variable inside object (can also be use on left side uv =)
object-value to get indexed variable inside objcet (can also be use on left side uv =) be same index if object pointer the same

Numbers:
Ar # and integer number. Number ar global object can be acses and changed the same as enything els, it has these variables bilt in:
prev=number-1
next=number+1
sgn= -1 for <0 0 for =0 +1 for >0

Main Object:
The object the main object has these varible objects ar pre-coded:
in = to input 1byte
out = to output 1byte
x = set to number value to in/out
