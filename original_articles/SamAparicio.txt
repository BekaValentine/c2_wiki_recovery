Sam, I tried to post the following comment on your blog, but the comments bit of MT doesn't seem to answer.  So, here it is.
    Nice idea, Sam.  I'm an Angel customer, so I saw you on Wiki and came over to look.
    
    Have you looked at Agile PM practices yet?  ScrumProcess on Wiki might be something
    to look into.  In fact, there's a whole ton of good PM material buried in Wiki.
