The Urban Monk is an attempt at finding the essence of modern techno urban living in worldwide major cities.

Currently, http://urbanmonk.blogspot.com is a blog made of free resources and  webware kept by a Montreal-based ecommerce consultant. It features some personal stuff but tries to illustrate the contemporary urban reality and thinking of a late generation X "urban world citizen" through news and critics, links, images and other multimedia content.

So far I have no idea how the Wikiwiki concept can contribute to TheUrbanMonk, but I believe there is some potential.



----

I decided to try the wikiwikiweb as a public space for discussions and reactions related to TheUrbanMonk weblog.

* The first page is DiscussNews page where TheUrbanMonk readers can add or discuss any news item of interest.
* Another page is the AddBlog page where you can add a link to other weblogs.
