20030702.0056 I cannot believe that this wiki hasn't addressed this topic yet

Maybe I just haven't seen it as a QuickChangesJunkie -- but try this:

I can do the laundry and the dishes at the same time, I just load the machines and press start.  Then I can watch StarTrek till those tasks are done.

Vacuuming and LawnMowing require my presence and control.  I have to stay with the device HelpingMe till we finish the task.

What are the different names for these forms of MultiTasking?

	* ''Foreground task.  Something you need to interact with on a terminal or via the GUI, for example to enter commands and read their output.''
	* ''Background task.  You kick it off (perhaps even via a timer) and it does some job without you supervision.''
''There's a whole grey area in between.  Something which is apparently a foreground task that you're not attending to because nothing is happening (e.g. no new mail) becomes a background task, 'til the mail arrives and the thing beeps at you.  Thinking can be like this (UngarMethod).  Conversely, if your background task hits a problem and the cron daemon sends you an email, you may need to interact with the thing to get it working correctly.''

''StarTrek can become a background task too, if you use your video recorder and then don't bother to watch the tape. (GaveUpOnTelevision)''
