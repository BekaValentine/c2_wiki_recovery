The GccIntrospectorProject intends to add support for introspection in GnuCompilerCollection itself. If it succeeds, the TonePreprocessor will not be needed.

'''Release Name:''' introspector-gcc-0.1 2006-02-17

'''Notes:''' ''This is the first release of a new gcc introspector implementation. It uses a new directory structure as the output and finally you can use textutils and perl to process the asts! I have converters from this directory structure to a html page in a tree structure, albeit very simple.''

'''Installation'''

This is interesting as the package does not have the usual stuff e.g. configure, README, INSTALL to explain what is contained and what else has to be installed. 

Some information on this is at http://freshmeat.net/projects/introspector/
