A visual learner is a person who learns by watching. Graphics is also closely related to VisualLearner's style. Each person has a dominant learning style. It is the mode in which they learn most easily. Learning by hearing and text are closely related to the AuditoryLearner's style. Learning by doing by muscle movement or perhaps by GuiActionTrace is closely related to kinesthetic learning. --JonGrover
