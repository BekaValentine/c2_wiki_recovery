Hi,  this is the place  to  debate about interconnections and interactions between Oracle and Microsoft technologies. 
I won't place code here, check out http://oraclevsmicrosoft.blogspot.com/  Last two entries are about :
     - A sample code for a mini web crawler
     - Oracle functions

last question (06/01/2005):

There is many tools to generate connection code  for sql server database  around .Net platform. 
For instance Microsoft promote something called Olymars, (that's a reference  to  the french soccer team '''Olympique de Marseille''', never mind)
http://www.microsoft.com/france/msdn/technologies/outils/olymars/default.asp
This tool calls itself "SQL Server Centric". 

The question is, what can be do to build  something like this for Oracle DB?
I mean, a free and open tool.

Last year question (12/15/04)

PLSQL/Versus client side code ? 

When  and why choose to implement logic into triggers and stored procedures and  not into the .Net application. 

Lets consider  that you have a DataWarehouse in an Oracle Database. There is a new entry point, a new source of informations in the company. The job is  to build a new application with its specific process to  fill in this. 

The answer to this question  will be quite different depending on:

- If you  use a Web client or a winform base application. 

- The degree of integration of this new application into the existing information system.

Why did I create this page? 

A few weeks ago, I discover  wikiwiki and, maybe too enthusiastic, I put many links to my own weblog. 

ElizabethWiethoff deleted the links  and post a comment on my blog. She explains me that  Wiki isn't an advertisement place. 
She suggested that I should create  my own wiki page  on which I could put the links I would. 
She is right! So this is OracleVsMicrosoft Wiki page.
