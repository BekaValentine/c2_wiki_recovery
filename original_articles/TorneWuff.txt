Some wolf programmer dude. Massive Python fan. Writing an OS in Python just because it's funny: http://launchpad.net/pycorn

As regards RealNamesPlease: My legal name is Richard Coles. However, I use 'Torne' in pretty much every situation (''but not to my bank manager'') - it is not an online 'nick'. It's analogous to someone who is called Thomas asking to be called Tom, with the exception that my preferred name is not in fact a contraction. It got discussed on RealNamesPleaseDiscussion and someone concurred with me to the extent of adding me as an example on RealNamesPlease =).

If you want to email me, I am torne, at the domain wolfpuppy.org.uk
