From DilBert:
A bunch of big-brained scientific types are on a bus singing...
	 :	''"Infinite number of beers on the wall,''
	 :	'' infinite number of beers.''
	 :	'' You take one down and pass it around...''
	 :	'' Infinite number of beers on the wall!"''
	 :	''<repeats  ;->''
After a while, the bus driver gets sick of it and yells that they'll never to get to zero.
