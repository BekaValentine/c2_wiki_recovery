Of all the books I have read, the one that have changed me most, is without doubt IshmaelBook by DanielQuinn ([ISBN 0553375407]).

This is the novel that, out of 2500 submissions, won the ecological-minded TurnerTomorrowAward --and caused a mutiny among the judges when it was awarded the $500,000 first prize.
