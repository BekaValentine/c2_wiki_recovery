JASSWiki is an ASP/IIS implementation of a Wiki Wiki Web. It is written in VBScript and runs with minimal installation under Microsoft(r) IIS.

Because the JASSWiki was originally based off of the Dolphin Wiki (perl based), you will find that it has a lot of similar features that Dolphin has with some features of its own.

	* No Database Required.
	* Generates html files. Blazing fast browsing.
	* Search: Performs a keyword search through the entire wiki site.
	* WikiReferences: An 'almost' complete implementation of the Wiki---References.
	* Categories: generated automagically from related pages field.
	* Index: list of all pages available on that wiki.
	* Security: Allows you to create PRIVATE wikis restricting access to only those users who have permission.

JASSWiki is a public domain, OpenSource project. We seek to enhance, and make available the JASSWiki in accordance to the principles of the Open Source community.

You are invited and encouraged to participate/Contribute in the development, enhancement, testing, and repair of the JASSWiki for the benefit of the entire IIS/ASP community.
