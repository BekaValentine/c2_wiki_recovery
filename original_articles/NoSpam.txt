'''Spambot Poisoning''' 

My tramspap was an attempt to combine the idea with a tarpit, after I got hit by the "we've found your site and it isn't on some search engines" spambot.

Most Spambot Poisoning pages are quite blatant, and therefore could be filtered out easily. Also, many generate addresses of random domains, so they will put additional load on the root nameservers and/or hit innocent bystanders at random.

Try to find out who the spammers are and then put their e-mail addresses on the Spambot Poisonig pages
