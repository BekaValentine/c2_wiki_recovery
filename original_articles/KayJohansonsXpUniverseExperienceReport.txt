The most interesting part of this presentation, for me, was the description of how the leaders of XP team, having delivered on time, was asked to leave the company.  The other, non-XP team, were perceived as working harder.  They were behind schedule, but for reasons that "weren't their fault" -- such as the customer changing their mind, the database not working as expected, etc.  The XP team, unlike the other team, didn't work overtime, didn't have a lot of design documentation on the walls, and spent a lot of time chatting in pairs.
