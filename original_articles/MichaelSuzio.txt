A lead software developer for Internet Security Systems; head of the development team for the MSS Customer Portal project.

Michael is a big fan of Java, but has serious problems with it's lack of
MultipleInheritance and lack of support for DynamicTyping. He's starting
to like SchemeLanguage and DylanLanguage a lot.  CeePlusPlus is just too nasty to even want to get into -- he likes his pointers hidden, thank you.

Michael is also very interested in Artificial Intelligence formalisms and algorithms, and is considering a Masters degree in this discipline.
