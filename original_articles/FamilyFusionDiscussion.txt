Part of the ObjectBasedProgramming Pattern.

----
I do not understand the following paragraph found in FamilyFusion:
	 :	The FunctionPointer pattern is not applied in this example. The function pointers are treated the same way as the attributes if the operation pointer had been applied. 
-- ScottWalsh

Had the FunctionPointer pattern variation#1 been applied, the instance data for a particular class has to contain the function pointers. Had we applied the FamilyFusion pattern and merged the instance data structures for multiple classes into one, the merged instance data structure has to contain the aggregate of all function pointers.

Hope this helps.
