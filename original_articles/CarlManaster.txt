Welcome to WardsWiki! I see from your link above that you are principally a programmer who has worked in the specialty of MiningCadSoftware. Since the site is involved in ExtremeProgramming, could you tell us some more about this? Did you use it in developing your software? -- DonaldNoyes

Short answer: No.

If anyone knew about XP back when I worked in Mining, I wasn't one of them. This was in the time period 1985-1993. I was doing object-oriented programming (using Object Pascal), but that's about as far as it goes.

I only learned about XP roughly when the White Book came out; I haven't had a chance to do much of "big" XP (like pair programming and onsite customer), but I do what I can - ''lots'' of TDD and refactoring. Hoping to do more.
