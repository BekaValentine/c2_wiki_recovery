'''Definition:''' A term that defines the standard unit of time that one has been a WikiMember, WikiLurker, or WikiCitizen. Thus, in context, one would say that one has been a WikiCitizen for 11 W''''''ikiYears.

Sort of like "doggy-years"; an off-the-cuff measurement of W''''''ikiMembership.

To find out what real amount of time that a W''''''ikiYear is equal to, I think that we would consider what the average turn-over is for WikiZen''''''s.  We would then assign this turn-over rate (for example: 3 months) as being the definition of a W''''''ikiYear. (If figuring out this turn-over rate isn't intuitive, then the community could agree on a period of time.)

Then 
* WikiNewbie''''''s would be <1 W''''''ikiYears old,
* WikiZens or a W''''''ikiRegular would be <5  W''''''ikiYears old, but older than 'Noobs
* WikiVeteran''''''s would be <10 W''''''ikiYears old, but older than 'Zens
etc.  

Would there then be cause to have such labels as W''''''ikiAncients or W''''''ikiMethusalehs? Just kidding. Seriously though, I just think that the concept would add a bit of good-natured fun.

WikiMaster, though, would still remain an accolade earned through practicing the WikiWay, instead of just being the oldest W''''''ikiMember on the block.
