ProceduralCode follows the StructuredProgramming method and predates ObjectOrientation. Because the methodology is looser, the devolution into SpaghettiCode is easier.

''"Looser"? please explain. I find OOP poorly or inconsistently defined (NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs). Thus, OO hardly qualifies as "tight".''

In my experience, programmers who think they are doing ObjectOrientedProgramming are often using an ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage to write ProceduralCode instead.

I don't see the need to create a new topic. We already have 3 or so topics about procedural.

''We do?  Which ones do you mean.  I found this page looking for a page that I would expect to be named ProceduralProgramming.''

''{I agree. ProceduralProgramming would be a better name. (EditHint)}''
