Wiki is the only kind of jungle i like to get lost in.

''But I've encountered some poisonous toads here.''

[It can also be a bit like an evil black forest at times too, with witches, warlocks, vampires and werewolves, who can jump out at unexpected and inappropriate times.  But, mostly it's good.  Biggest trouble comes from power struggles, from those that are inclined to strangle the life out of Wiki.]

Some people spend a lot of time erecting signposts in the jungle.
