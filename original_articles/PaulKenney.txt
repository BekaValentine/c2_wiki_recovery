With a formal education in programming I have been developing applications using MacromediaColdFusion since 1998.  I have returned to ObjectOrientedProgramming using ColdFusionComponents (CFCs).  I have written a port of the JUnit framework using CFCs called cfcUnit, which can be found at http://www.cfcunit.org.  I also keep a blog called Best Served Cold at http://www.pjk.us/blog.

I currently reside in SanFrancisco and work for the law firm Littler Mendelson doing MacromediaColdFusion development using the MachII framework.
