A management and staffing AntiPattern.

Your project has a high turnover. Programmers are changed continuously, you have to train them and wait for them to achieve team performance.

You can be creating a temporary NetNegativeProducingProgrammer.

You will have also a MythicalManMonth typical problem, the BrooksLaw.
