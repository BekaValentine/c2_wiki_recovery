A filename where the date of creation or last edit is appended to the name of the document.  Obviously, this information is redundant in any modern filesystem--this information is stored as metadata.  However, the PrimaryKey of files in most OS filesystems is the name and only the name; use of DateStampedFilename''''''s is intended as a workaround so <Name, Date> can be the PrimaryKey instead.
----
This FileNamingConvention can be used to represent something other than the date and time the file was created or edited. It can represent an event as in 20010911.event, or a documents as in 17760704.document. Dates and times can be used as markers of more than when a file became or changed, it can be a marker of something a user or filenamer wishes to categorize or group using timeline naming.

It also can be used in DottedPrefixExtensions to further distinguish a filename, or in markers or tags to represent versions or states at a given time.
