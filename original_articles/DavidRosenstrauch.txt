Some details about me:
	* Software developer, working primarily with Java
	* Currently employed at grid software vendor Data Synapse (http://www.datasynapse.com)
	* Very intrigued by ExtremeProgramming, though unfortunately I haven't had too much opportunity to use it hands-on (except for TestFirst, which kicks ass!)
	* Former member of the NewYorkStudyGroup DesignPatternsStudyGroup
	* Attendee of the 1997 UsingPatterns conference
	* Reachable via e-mail at: mailto:darose@darose.net
