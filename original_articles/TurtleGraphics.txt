Turtle graphics is a style of computer drawing based on preserved state (position and orientation) and a small number of operations against that state (forward, turn, pen up & down). SeymourPapert promoted (invented?) turtle graphics and the associated turtle geometry as a simplification that made computers and algorithmic thought accessible to kids. The state was called the ''turtle'' and programs taught the turtle how to draw.
