The idea of MessageReposting, is that if I am reading a message from some sort of BulletinBoard or PushTechnology, and I think it is good, I can ''repost'' the message and it will be read by message readers who are subscribed to me in some way, and who may not yet be aware of the message in question. MessageReposting allows a message to spread from its original source to other people who do not even know of the source, without losing the SpamProof quality of the communications system. See the MiskiProject. -- PhilipDorrell
