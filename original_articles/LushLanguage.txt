Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale numerical and graphic applications. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, or other languages.

There are in fact two different versions current, which can be installed together without interfering.

* lush 1.2.1 which is included in some Linux distributions (binary ''lush'')
* lush 2.0.1 which is in current development (binary ''lush2'')
