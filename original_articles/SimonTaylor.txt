Take a look at MeatballWiki for discussions of wiki self-governance and so on.  It has all been hashed out, categorized, beaten to death, then resurrected and done over a dozen times.  This wiki has what amounts to a mob mentality.  That is how most things are decided and enforced.  There is also an official "steward" system (WardsWikiStewards), but it's almost entirely ineffective and powerless.  -- MichaelSparks
