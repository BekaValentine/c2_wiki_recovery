Kawa is a Java-based scheme system (http://www.gnu.org/software/kawa/).

A compiler from an extended SchemeLanguage dialect to JavaLanguage ByteCode''''''s. The
language extensions are for dealing with java objects. In scheme, you
can:

	* Call methods of java objects/classes
	* Create objects
	* '''Implement classes'''
	* other stuff you'd expect

For example, here's Kawa code for an instance of a simple anonymous class:
 (object (<java.lang.Runnable>)
  ((run) <void>
	(display "I'm running!")))

WARNING! This compiler and associated runtime environment is deeply and incurably thread-unsafe! I've been bitten by this exactly once, and after looking deep into the code to try to repair it enough to make it usable for the project, have resolved never to touch it again. -- AdamBerger

Really?  The thread code works great in production code.  I don't remember this coming up on the Kawa mailing lists - what problems did you have? -- ChrisDean
