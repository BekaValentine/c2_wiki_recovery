'''Discussion'''

This is good in terms of what it links to, but could be even clearer. Click Edit''''''Text, which shows a text-edit area, etc.

''Agreed. Rather than "(see TextFormattingRules and GoodStyle)", I think it would be better to draw a reader's attention to the "items below the text area" when editing. -- RalphMellor''

Why not both? 

''In the context of brevity, anything but the highest value redundancy is a bad thing. Imo it's important to alert readers to momentarily focus on the stuff below the text area, but it's not important for them to know what those links are before they get to the edit screen.'' --RalphMellor
