''The Commonwealth'' is a large international organization that includes many former and current British colonies as well as the 15 CommonwealthRealms. Only the Realms and colonies recognize the Queen of England as their head of state. The Commonwealth's republican members, such as IndiaCountry and SouthAfrica merely observe the Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth, a ceremonial figure who holds no political power over their nation.
