''It sounds like the initial reaction to patterns. First, code is just code, then code is patterns, then code is just code again. --BrianRobinson''

I have found this gem on ThreeStagesInJeetKuneDo (it is slightly elaborated on MartialArtsAsSoftwareDevelopmentMetaphor).

I think it warrants a page of its own (without the context of martial arts),
because this seems to be the essence of what makes up an experienced software developer.
