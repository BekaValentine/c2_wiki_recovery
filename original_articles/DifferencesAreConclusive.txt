''The idea that the BestPractice in one instance may not be the best practice in another instance'' 

It is a case of ItDepends. There is not always one BestAnswer that fits all situations.

This is particularly true with regard to those 
* who operate on different platforms
* have different goals
* favor certain approaches which have brought them success. 
There exists several ideas or practices that can accomplish the same or slightly different results
* with the same or slightly different effort
* using the same or radically different configurations
It is often only a MatterOfChoice
