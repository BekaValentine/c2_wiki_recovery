By contrast with the FatMiddleArchitecture, in the FatBottomedArchitecture all business logic is encoded as schemas, seed data, and StoredProcedures in the data tier, which in the best of all possible worlds will be a BpMs scripted in BizTalk or similar.

The middle tier is preferably auto-generated from a standard template. GUI designers control generation of the front end, so really the only place a developer can screw up is in SQL, which is hard to screw up in. And very soon the whole front end will be generated by XformsTechnology, removing the last skericks of clumsy ObjectOrientedProgramming from the Enterprise AspectOrientedProgramming stack.

''ReFactoring?'' 

That's old technology.
