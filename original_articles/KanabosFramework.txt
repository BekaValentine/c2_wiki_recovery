Kanabos Event Driven Objects Framework is a JavaLanguage based Framework hosted on java.net

"Event Driven Objects" (http://www.kanabos.com/purl/event-driven-objects.html) communicate using asynchronous events rather than remote method calls. The advantages of this approach are:

* High performance (no waiting for remote methods to return)
* Natural Parallelism
* Decoupling of senders and receivers means that interactions not envisaged at design time are supported

High performance Distributed Objects enable a wide range of applications. However early uses are in "Multitaneous" 
(http://www.kanabos.com/purl/multitaneous.html) applications, for example the Shared Page Multitaneous Editor
which is available at http://www.sharedpage.com, and can be launched via the http://www.sharedpage.com/download/Multitaneous.jnlp webstart link.

"Event Driven Architecture" (http://www.kanabos.com/purl/event-driven-architecture.html) is a good thing in general, and you don't need Kanabos technology to enable distributed Objects to communicate via events rather than remote calls. However the aim of "Event Driven Objects" is to provide maximum support for Event Driven Architecture. For example one essential aspect of Event Driven Architectures turns out to be event histories. This concept has been integrated right into the Objects themselves so that every Field of an Object has a "Data Event History" 
(http://www.kanabos.com/purl/data-event-history.html) which is accessible at all times. These and other issues addressed are summarised on the "Building Blocks (Bricks)" page at http://www.kanabos.com/purl/building-blocks.html.
