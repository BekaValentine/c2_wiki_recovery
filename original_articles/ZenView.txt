If there is a beautiful view, don't spoil it by building
huge windows that gape incessantly at it.  Instead, put the
windows which look onto the view at places of transition--
along paths, in hallways, in entry ways, on stairs, between rooms.

If the view window is correctly placed, people will see
a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window
or pass it: but the view is never visible from the places
where people stay.

This reminds me of a sculpture in Eindhoven TheNetherlands.  In the middle of a traffic circle at the end of a long straightaway, there is a sculpture which at certain times of day looks like the Penrose impossible triangle, or "tribar", when driving towards it.
