I'm a native of TheNetherlands. Languages I speak are:
* DutchLanguage (native)
* EnglishLanguage (with a heavy Dutch accent)
* CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus
* PhpLanguage, TclLanguage, a little PerlLanguage, JavaLanguage
* VhdlLanguage
* LabView (though I really want to recycle those neurons)

I'm also trying to be a LanguageDesigner.

My email address is: wouter (on) irdc (dot) nl (though I may not respond to email; I'm generally busy).

Wiki pages I've started:
* this page
* OperatorPrecedenceConsideredHarmful
* VhdlLanguage

Well, I've grown tired of C/C++, don't really like Java and figured I should probably try designing something myself. I'm specifically going for something that can be compiled and is powerful enough to replace C in almost all situations (possibly excluding OS-programming). Languages I find inspirational are:
* CeeLanguage (the way it manages to be at least usable almost everywhere)
* LabView (not the layout, but the DataFlowProgramming concepts)
* TclLanguage / LispLanguage (the extensibility and utter simplicity of the core language)
* HaskellLanguage (syntax and semantic issues of user-defined operators)
* SmalltalkLanguage (the daring attitude of the designers)
