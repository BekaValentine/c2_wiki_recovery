SnipSnap is a Java-based WikiLog (wiki + WebLog), modelled after ''VaNilla'' (which was written in Rebol). and is written with servlets and JSP. Development of SnipSnap ceased in 2007.

'''Background:'''
	* Servlet + JSP.
	* Embedded ''Jetty'' (servlet container + Web server) or WAR distribution.
	* Embedded ''McKoi'' (Java database engine) ''Wasn't reliable, now any JDBC provider or just filesystem -- HansGerwitz''  (Now uses filesystem by default.)
	* Very easy to install
	* runs on Windows ''and anything else''

'''Strength:'''

	* UI is very clean and modern, including built-in themes
	* Clean and powerful syntax (including tables, code formatting, etc)
	* Support multiple users
	* Support a weblog style frontpage (create pages with dates as names, then they get listed in reverse chronological order on the front page)
	* Built-in full-text search


'''Weakness:'''

	* No revision control (once a page is deleted, it's gone forever) ''This has been addressed, but refactoring (e.g. renaming a snip) is still limited -- HansGerwitz'' ''Addressed, or fixed?  'Addressed' sounds like a workaround -- BinkleyBinkley'' / ''As of version 0.5.2a, revisions are saved and you can view diffs between versions. -- JohnHume''
	* No real backlinks support (backlinks are really HTTP referrers in SnipSnap), which means some wiki traditions like ''CategoryCategory'' don't work
	* Built-in themes' CSS not well-tested across browsers (lots of ugliness in MicrosoftInternetExplorer, though this is easily fixed from the UI, as all CSS pages are Wiki pages (or "snips", as SnipSnap likes to call them) editable by an Admin)
	* No support for deleting snips or comments.

SnipSnap calls itself a wiki but it does not have the WikiNature. It's more of a ContentManagementSystem and/or PortalServer than the social experiment in knowledge representation of the TrueWiki. This is not a bad thing. But for recording the collective knowledge of an organization like a development team, SnipSnap is MassiveOverkill.
