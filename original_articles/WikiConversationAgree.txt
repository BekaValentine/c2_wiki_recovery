So the contributions on WikiConversation agree on some things, and this is the
page on which to say it.  If you don't agree with what's here, '''remove it'''
and pay a visit to WikiConversationArgue to say why.
That needn't stop us being a bit contentious here - to seduce someone into
taking the topic off in that way.

There's advantages in a threaded discussion that flow from continuity - I only
need to read the bottom of the page (hey, who fancies threaded conversations 
with the convention of additions ''at the top'' ?) 'cos I've already read all
the stuff before my last post.

There's advantages to a synopsis - I can catch up with what folk think about
the topic without having to wade through all that vigorous contending, thesis
and antithesis.

What else might we agree on ;^)
