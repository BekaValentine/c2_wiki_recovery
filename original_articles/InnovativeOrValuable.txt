''This Wiki is full of your contrary and unsubstantiated assertions.  With logical arguments and evidence to back them up, some of them might be innovative or valuable, and worthy of recognition.  Without logical arguments and evidence to back them up, they're nothing but questionable opinion.''

Let's put an InnovativeOrValuable tag on ideas that might be innovative or valuable if properly supported.

{Let's not. Until there's support, how can we tell whether they're innovative or valuable or not?}

{A better tag for such things might be ProveIt Or LacksEvidence.}

Maybe PleaseAddEvidence

{I like it.}
