Roger joined TekLabs from XeroxParc.  He designed, built
and programmed the MagnoliaWorkstation.  This machine made
the labs worth joining.  AllenWirfsBrock joined the labs
to write Smalltalk for the Magnolia.  Roger's window system
and drafting program (and Alan's Smalltalk) were the only
programs really used on that machine. Still, some people
don't like TheWayRogerWroteCode.
