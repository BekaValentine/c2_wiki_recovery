Describe ShapeWhatYouCanControl | CategoryWikiMaintenance 

The result of a bot reversal of edit change created this as a W''''''antedPage. I tried to fix it by inserting a horizontal rule betweeen ShapeWhatYouCanControl and CategoryWikiMaintenance, but it was reversed. alas!

This merely illustrates what can happen when bots make changes. Perhaps the Bot's Master will correct this.

It was the result of an original edit meant to remove pages I had written from the SeeAlso.

I put it in correct form, viewed it, then shaped it into what I could control: a local pdf, properly constructed with the removals missing.

I am investingating and testing ways that wiki pages can be stored locally or perhaps in a cloud using WoolenLanguage techniques and processes 
* By using WikiBatics
** done by viewing and locally shaping the pages in the list as a local fully linking pdf)
** This technique has been used to store thousands of pages from multiple sources in forms that are shaped around a topic or category, and can be viewed using only my local machine (computer offline).
