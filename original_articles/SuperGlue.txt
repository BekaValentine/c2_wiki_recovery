A fast-setting adhesive (often based on the chemical cyanoacrylate) used for bonding most plastics to other plastics by means of a chemical reaction which essentially fuses the mating parts together.  

SuperGlue often refers to any of a series of similar adhesives with similar properties. It sets in seconds. It bonds skin instantly. It can be used (with varying effectiveness) on plastic, wood, masonry/porcelain/ceramics, metal, glass, leather, rubber, and many other materials (hence the name).

A TradeName owned by Henkel Adhesives/Loctite (http://www.loctite.com), SuperGlue is often used to identify any of a number of similar adhesives such as Crazy Glue, Space Glue, and most manicurists' fingernail glues. Most, if not all, can be removed with artificial fingernail remover or pure acetone.

And it works great as a bandage to boot.
