'''What Others Say'''

A wise gentleman who works very hard on whatever he is trying to do.  If he was asked to move the world, he wouldn't ask how.  Intstead, he would think of a way to do it.  He has many WiseSayings which he has come up with over time.

'' Sit back, relax, the world moves well enough on its own :)''

'''That was not the point.''' ;)
