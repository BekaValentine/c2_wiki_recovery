''Arguing to preserve the status quo is usually done in the context of opposing a large, often radical change. The social movement is an example of the status quo being challenged. The term frequently refers to the status of a large issue, such as the current culture or social climate of an entire society or nation.''

'''Original question:''' What the hell does this mean anyway? I've heard it used so many ways that don't relate at all to what I thought it meant...

What I thought it meant: Not rocking the boat; same-old same-old; established standard (for better or worse).
