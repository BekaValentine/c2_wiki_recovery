An online streaming music radio and video service that allows you to customize your preferred genre, artist, album, songs, etc.  Your customized station can also be influenced by subscribing to other DJs and/or US radio stations.

One neat feature is that songs and videos can be paused.

In any case, this is the only way I figure I can blend my weird musical preferences into one radio station.

Not surprisingly, LaunchCast has been disabled in response to a pending lawsuit...

''I rated a couple thousand songs and now it's all for nothing...''

Lawsuit resolved but now bought by Yahoo and the DJ subscription recommender system seems to have disappeared.

''And now all the neat features from the old free system are back if you subscribe to LaunchCast Premium''
