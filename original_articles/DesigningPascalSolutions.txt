This is supposedly a book of case studies that is
suitable for intro programmers learning Pascal.
In fact, it is probably the first book of software
patterns.  Clancy and Linn call them ''templates'',
but their template appendix looks a lot like a
pattern catalog.  The patterns are all the low-level
patterns that people learn in their first programming
course.  The list (in the order they are taught) is

	* Prompt, Then Read
	* Input, Process, Output
	* Input One, Process One
	* Do Something a Specified Number of Times
	* Select from Alternatives
	* Input and Process Until Done
	* Process in Cycles
	* Accumulate Values Until Done
	* Fill an Array
	* Process Every Element of a One-dimensional Array
	* Search a One-dimensional Array
	* Insert Into a One-dimensional Array
	* Copy a One-dimensional Array
	* Insert While Copying a One-dimensional Array
	* Process Elements in a File Until Done
	* Insert Into a File
	* Process Elements in a Two-dimensional Array Until Done
	* Process the Diagonal of a Two-dimensional Array
	* Read Forward, Process Backward
	* Divide and Process Elements
