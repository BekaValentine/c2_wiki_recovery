Hi there. I'm Gregory Miller, not to be confused with GregMiller apparently of Diebold (the ATM bank devices), although my friends do refer to me as Greg.  

I am with Inherent.Com (http://www.inherent.com), a 5 year old Internet information systems company serving legal and financial communities worldwide.  Some trivia: 
	* software engineer and lawyer with a background in objects dating back to Smalltalk in the early 80s.  
	* former Tektronix (http://www.tektronix.com) software engineer (`81-`84), 
	* former Computervision (http://www.computervision.com) user interface designer and technical writer (`85-`89), 
	* former contract software engineer with NeXT Computer (http://www.next.com) (`89-`90), and 
	* former IP lawyer once with Marger Johnson et al (http://www.techlaw.com) (`89-`91).  

Inherent.Com is active in objects through Java applications development.  We build virtual community centers and Internet software apps for the legal profession, insurance, investment banking, and others. Check out my friend and employee, GabrielWachob, who lurks here and has some kewl ideas. 

I'm interested in patterns and in my spare time, am immersed in the Addison-Wesley book called "Design Patterns" (http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/DPBook/DPBook.html), a text on reusability by a host of authors (Gamma, Helm et al); obviously well known to this community.

ThankYou WardCunningham for putting PortlandPatterns together.  Ward is a well known and respected "objectist" :-) in the Silicon Forest, and I'm sure well known to the Object community at large.  I am pleased to have discovered this community here.  Thanks Ward.

I find Patterns to have some interesting and intriguing application in jurisprudence.
