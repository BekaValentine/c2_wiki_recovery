Planning (as a verb) is more beneficial than producing a physical plan (PlanAsNoun).

(from http://www.strategicfutures.com/articles/stratpln/stratpln.htm)
''Dwight D. Eisenhower said it best: "Plans are nothing, planning is everything." While your strategic planning activities will result in a document, the document itself matters less than the process of collecting and analyzing input, and thoughtful discussion and debate.''

An AgileDevelopmentMethodology seeks the path of least resistance to capture information generated during planning so that an archival plan is available for communication to others.
