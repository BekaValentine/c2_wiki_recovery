The ZX80 was a MicroComputer from SinclairResearch, released in 1980. It used the Zilog Z80, had 1K of RandomAccessMemory and a membrane keyboard.

It was the predecessor of the more popular SinclairZxEightyOne. It was also slightly more expensive. Not as rugged or as cool looking (white and blue rather that the ZX81 all black).

My dad bought one as a kit and put it together, using a soldering iron and lots of patience. It was cheaper that way. You had to solder all of the individual components onto the board. I think we still have it somewhere. --MatthewFarwell.
