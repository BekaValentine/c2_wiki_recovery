Within DefiningContext there is an entry

''Purpose (What''''''For''''''Why)''

The original context of this pages seems to be a technical computing one, but it seems to me that the discussion can be widened to include in the context the ways in which the writer wishes to influence the readers. This widens further if the item is to be broadcast via the internet or even a radio interview.  Purpose can then include some wider objectives.

* Probe
* Request
* Expose
* Explain
* Distort
* Convince
* Excuse
* Blame
* Divert attention
* Negotiate
* Ridicule
* Imitate

Many of these can be heard in the course of interviews with political figures or in political satire.

''Expanding the context of (Who), one might also apply the list as used in interviews of sports figures, or of business figures, or of religious leaders, in fact of almost any one of renown in a specialty area, and within a more immediate context -- this wiki, of Wikizens. In the above list, it appears that half of them fulfill under the context of (Why) the use to discredit, defame or disrespect. '' -- DonaldNoyes

Sadly yes, and that is always going to be a problem in interpreting information out of its context. That is a problem historians will have with an old document. That occurs with old pages on this wiki. I value very much discussion of context and category.  -- JohnFletcher

Context also has a meaning within a computer program, for example each member exists within the context of its class (and its object if instantiated). Each column exists within the context of its table. TechnicalContext? -- JonGrover
