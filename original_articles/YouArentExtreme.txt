''Follow or follow not. There is no whine. -- RonJeffries''

We've heard this before on Wiki. You can do ''blah blah'', but if you do '''YOU AREN'T EXTREME!''' <FX: lightning crack, rolling thunder>

You may have thought that you were going to get away with using some of the ExtremeProgramming practices, well that ain't '''extreme''', buddy. And that's a '''sin!''' You gotta do it like they did it on C3, er, I mean, like it says in the book, see, all of it, otherwise you goin' to '''hell!''' An if Ron tells you sompin' diff'rent from the book, why you just gotta do it like Ron says, or else you project gonna '''fail'''. You think you can ''pick'' and ''choose'' the commandments!? You think the Lord gonna turn a blind eye if you don't do em all right, and call'em like the Prophets called em? Why there's no path but the True path, friends. If you ain't ''Right with Ron'' your project gonna twist and turn in the '''fire!''' The fires of Un-Extremety, my friends, the fires of sub-optimal processes! Why, you can hear the sinners screamin' from here, yessir, they didn't listen to Ron, they went off and they ''did'' LoadFactor, they ''did'' CommitmentSchedule, and where are they now my friends? Lost in the burning fires of confusion! That's where. Repent my friends, repent from your old ways, '''''see''' the TRUTH!!!'''

If you start extreme, and don't change your process (when your measurements indicate you should) because you are worried about staying extreme, then you are no longer extreme. Therefore don't worry about whether you are extreme or not, understand the principles and know whether you are extreme or not. -- ErikMeade

For the most part, I find XPers pretty tolerant of non XP stuff. Saying something isn't XP isn't a value judgement. There are 12 practices in XP. If you're doing them, you're doing XP. If you're not, you're not. -- JohnBrewer

Let's call it "Extreme Variants" then, like Christianity, Catholicism and blah blah blah. -- RoyO
