A group of SmallTalkers are going to meet in March 2000 to make the world a better place for Smalltalk and to have a great time.
This will be a very hands-on event, we are going to write code, not just talk about writing code.  One of our goals is to unify the Smalltalk world, which means we are building things that can be used with any dialect of Smalltalk.
