
Many debates here on Wiki (and elsewhere) center on the ''responsibilities'' of programmers--to a wide variety of parties.  Many design methodologies (including ExtremeProgramming) focus on a programmer's responsibilities to the "customers" of a project (stakeholders, end-users).  Other discussions have focused on a programmer's responsibility to society at large; to a programmer's responsibility to the programming and technical community; and to him/herself.

Following is a list of responsibilities programmers ''may'' (some are debatable) have to the above groups.  The list may include conflicting responsibilities--that's OK.  Feel free to add your own--or if you are ambitious, add your own category (but define it).  OK to put the same responsibility in more than one category, if it applies.

As programming attempts to become more "respectable", and become recognized as an engineering discipline (alongside mechanical, civil, and chemical); or a profession (alongside accounting, law, and medicine), or a craft/trade/art/whatever--these responsibilites will come more and more into play.

The groups to whom programmers have reponsibilities:

	* '''Our Stakeholders''':  Whoever is paying for the programmer's work.

	* '''Our Customers''':  The end-users of the programmer's work.  In many situations, the stakeholders and customers are one and the same (or at least in the same organization).  In others (shrinkwrap software, embedded systems); they are separate entities.

	* '''Our society''': If programmers are to be recognized and treated as professionals; we must have obligations to society at large--not just the folks paying the bills.

	* '''Our peers''': Our fellow programmers, and the other members of the technical community.  Also includes aspiring and future programmers, at whatever stage of development.

	* '''Ourselves and our families''': Self explainatory
