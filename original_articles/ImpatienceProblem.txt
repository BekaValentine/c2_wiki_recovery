The ImpatienceProblem on this wiki is where someone has an idea and starts to implement it. They do some and then take a break for any or all of sleep, food, work etc. In the meantime it becomes a deletion candidate in the mind of someone else.

This is compounded by the 24 hour interval between indexing runs.

''It's been avoided "sometimes" when individual leaves notes explaining what they have planned and what they are doing.  But, even then, I have to admit, someone may not agree and then takes a '''psycho-commando-rule-all-in-mad-mood''' approach and undo all of said work.  I guess if have long project in mind, don't sleep until it's done, then maybe it will be too much work for others to bother to undo?''

There is also the TimeZoneAnomaly where we sleep at different times of the day to each other.
