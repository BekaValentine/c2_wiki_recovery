Application on a computer, designed for viewing WebSite''''''s. It talks to a WebServer (or more), and retrieves from there the files needed to put the graphical images (and/or other multimedial elements) on screen that were defined by the author of the WebSite.

Examples of WebBrowser''''''s:

* The canonical "Big Three":
** MicrosoftInternetExplorer 
** NetscapeNavigator ''in the past''
** MozillaFirefox
** GoogleChrome
* AlternativeBrowsers (GraphicalUserInterface)
* TextModeBrowser''''''s (CommandLineInterface)

The original NetscapeNavigator gave birth to the MozillaBrowser and other browsers powered by the GeckoEngine. See AlternativeBrowsers for these Gecko-based browsers, among others.

Let me air my views of what makes a great WebBrowser:

* easy to configure and cleanup (e.g., cache) and remove
* relatively safe, even against my own mistakes
* compatible with commonly used websites, including Microsoft sites
* has good RssViewer addons
* stop unsolicited ads
** MozillaFirefox said to block ads of all types, kill MacromediaFlash (if specified)
* responsive and good support for productive time on the web
** TabbedBrowsing being one example, especially in MaxthonBrowser
* easy to convert to minimalistic mode (e.g., no graphics)
* ?automated complaint filing for bad websites (e.g., scams)
* ?free of charges
