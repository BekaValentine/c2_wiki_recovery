Google used to index this wiki every few days, but not completely every few days (see argument on GoogleSearch). Currently the only major search engine that indexes this site is MSN Search.

An elaboration of how to do advanced searches on common search engines is beyond the scope of this page, but as an example, with MSN or Google, add "site:c2.com" to your search terms to restrict the search to this site only.

Use this link for an MSN search. Replace "your-search-terms-here" with your search terms:
http://search.msn.com/results.aspx?q=site%3Ac2.com+your-search-terms-here (Why MSN? See GoogleHatesWiki) Example prompt:

  MSN Search: [site:c2.com  functional programming]
Downsides to MSN (Bing):

* ''The URLs that result from this are odd. Also, graphic icons are missing. It appears to be indexing a mirror on the same domain.''

* It doesn't appear to index page titles anymore (HTML "head title"), even though I'm pretty sure it used to. It will only find it if you smoosh the words together. (08/24/2009) Here's the Google equivalent to get a second opinion:

http://search.google.com/search?q=site%3Ac2.com+your-search-terms-here

Visit http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/c2search.pl for an experimental search tool. The "C2 SearchHelper" allows complex searches using multiple terms connected by AND, OR, or AND-NOT.

----
There are search plug-ins for Mozilla based browsers that allow you to search from the MozillaBrowser sidebar or the MozillaFirefox search box directly.
* Find C2 Full Search and C2 Title Search at http://mycroft.mozdev.org/.
A plug-in might not be necessary! Set up your own MozillaFirefox Quick Searches to search directly from your URL bar without a plug-in.
* For a title search, create a bookmark with this location http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=%s and give it a keyword. For a text search, create a bookmark with this location http://www.c2.com/cgi/fullSearch?search=%s and give it some other keyword. Type the keyword and search word in the URL bar, and voila, feast your eyes on the c2 search results.
