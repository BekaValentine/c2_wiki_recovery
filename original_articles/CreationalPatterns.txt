A category of DesignPatterns discussed in the GangOfFour book. This category groups patterns that parameterize the behavior of a system based on the classes of objects it creates. Or, more simply put, patterns for dynamically selecting the class of objects to create. Some CreationalPatterns include:

	* AbstractFactoryPattern
	* FactoryMethodPattern
	* PrototypePattern
etc.
	* BuilderPattern
	* And the ever-popular and overused SingletonPattern

'''See also:''' StructuralPatterns, BehavioralPatterns

''Maybe the Java ParameterClasses idiom also fits in the CreationalPatterns category.''
