Sometimes a page with a certain title gets generated but is not used, or there is a better solution for the title.

In such cases it might be useful to have the possibility to change a title. All BackLink''''''s have to be adjusted of course. [''Which wikis do this''?]

	* AFAIK SwikiWiki (CoWeb) does it. Implementation is relatively easy, because pages are numbered and the page title is just an attribute of the page. -- HelmutLeitner.
	* QuickiWiki / ClusterWiki.
	* FoswikiEngine

How about using a redirect command? The old page name still works, but all it contains is a redirect to the new page.  Ways to implement redirect:

	* '''server transparent''' - user still sees the URL they requested, but server replaces (secretly!) the old page with the redirect with the content from the new page. 
		*plusses: automatic, fastest for client, server can detect redirect loops 
		*minuses: not revokable without a mess

	* '''HTTP redirect''' - server reads redirect on old page, sends a location header to the client directing it to load the new page
		*plusses: automatic, old URL becomes the new URL
		*minuses: redirect loops are possible, not easily revokable

	* '''meta-refresh''' or '''JavaScript redirect''' - old page serves message saying "this page will redirect in 5 seconds", and redirects
		*plusses: automatic (on most browsers), revokable
		*minuses: a little clumsy, not easily machine readable, breaks on non-JS browsers (e.g., Lynx)

	* '''forwarding address message''' -  just leave a text note saying where the new page is.
		*plusses: no new functionality, revokable
		*minuses: no automatic forwarding

I guess a simple forwarding address message is best.
