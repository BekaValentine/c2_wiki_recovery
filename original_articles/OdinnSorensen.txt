Once upon a time, I was a well-known figure in FidoNet, as the author of the message editor GoldED [2].

These days I am one of the lead gurus of system development in the danish part of World Online (a large ISP) [3]. We are going to try doing XP.

I went to XpTwoThousand with another developer from World Online Denmark, and we enjoyed it very much. Thanks to everyone! :-)
