From the JargonFile:

computer geek n. 

1. One who eats (computer) bugs for a living. One who fulfills all the dreariest negative
stereotypes about hackers: an asocial, malodorous, pasty-faced monomaniac with all
the personality of a cheese grater. Cannot be used by outsiders without implied insult to
all hackers; compare black-on-black vs. white-on-black usage of `nigger'. A
computer geek may be either a fundamentally clueless individual or a proto-hacker in
larval stage. Also called `turbo nerd', `turbo geek'. See also propeller head,
clustergeeking, geek out, wannabee, terminal junkie, spod, weenie. 2. Some
self-described computer geeks use this term in a positive sense and protest sense 1
(this seems to have been a post-1990 development). For one such argument, see
http://www.darkwater.com/omni/geek.html. See also GeekCode.
