Dean Elvy is a pseudonym for a middle-age unemployed software engineer. Retraining, one might say.  I'll not use multiple names and I won't mind if you determine my real identity.  I just don't like the idea that potential employers or friends can get on the Internet and read large numbers of one's writings composed in various states of mind in various types of forums.  I just won't do it under my real name.  I try to play nice, but sometimes have unpopular views and am occasionally untactful.

I looks like I may waste a bunch of my time "improving" some of the things wiki-newbies find (or should find) here that seem confusing or are otherwise nasty, rather than prioritizing my activities and spend the time learning as much of the wiki's wealth of software development information as I should.  We'll see.
