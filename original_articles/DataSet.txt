* In Microsoft parlance, a DataSet is an in-memory cache of data. The connection to the data sources does not need to be active for an application to view  and manipulate data in a DataSet.

* In IBM parlance, it's a file, though IBM tend to avoid a one-word definition to avoid confusion with their technical usage of "file".
