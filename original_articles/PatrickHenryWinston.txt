Many students learned LispLanguage from his introductory book, ''Lisp'' (ISBN 0201083191), commonly referred to as WinstonAndHorn.

He now has one called ''On to Java'' (ISBN 0201725932) at http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/phw/OnToJava/ .  The code in it
looks more like Lisp than any other JavaLanguage code out there. :-)

He has another book called ''OnToSmalltalk'' (ISBN 0201498278).

Also ''On to C [CeeLanguage]'' (ISBN 020158042X) and ''On to C++ [CeePlusPlus]'' (ISBN 0201580438). Plus ''ArtificialIntelligence'' (ISBN 0201533774).

In his spare time, he founded Ascent Technology in Cambridge, Mass. IraCooper can tell you more about it.

''Ascent cannot be that great of a company, for they use @#&! Flash on their website.'' (http://www.ascent.com/ FlashAlert) At least the site is navigable without MacromediaFlash, and you don't have to sit through a Flash splash before landing on the main page.
