A former Database programmer and former partner in a small software development firm - Geeks and Gurus, Inc. in Detroit, Michigan. Currently engaged in general business consulting.

A disciple of WardCunningham, SteveMcConnell, KentBeck, MartinFowler and the GangOfFour - an XP, OO, pattern and database freak, who unfortunately has gotten very turned off of the whole software development business.

Looking to find consulting opportunities that take advantage of my business experience and non-technical skills (see http://www.stephensawyer.com/content/SteveSawyer_SkillsList2.pdf), though I still love applying technology in my work.
