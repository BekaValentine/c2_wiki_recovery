Not much to say really.  Any Wiki BOFs planned?  What's the big topic this year?  Yada, yada, yada...  ''(See LetsMeetAtOopsla and XunitBofAtOopsla)''

Seems like architecture and distributed systems are very big this year; along with a smattering of metadata things.  

Big conversation topics will probably be 
* KentBeck's book ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange
* MartinFowler's RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode
* retreat from BigDesignUpFront
and the three volume set of framework books by MohamedFayad, RalphJohnson, and DouglasSchmidt.

So, I've never been to OOPSLA before and if I can persuade my boss to send me, what are people's recommendations?    ''--RichardEmerson''

OOPSLA is a five-ring circus.  There is way too much to do, and too much
to see.  As at most conferences, the important things are in the hallways.

Although you are past the deadlines for workshops, you can probably still
get into most of them if you ask nicely.  Contact the organizers of the
particular workshops you find interesting.  I always strongly recommend
workshops as a way to get to know people and a way to start some good
technical conversations that will last the rest of the week.  I also
recommend DesignFest.

I tend not to go to paper sessions because I read the papers instead.
I tend to hit panels and demos instead.  And talk a lot in the hallways.
