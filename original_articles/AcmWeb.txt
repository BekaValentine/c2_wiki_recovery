The AssociationForComputingMachinery maintains a digital library with a huge corpus of research papers, proceedings, and other information.

Full access is available only to ACM Members (in other words, those who pay yearly dues), but some papers and proceedings are available for download with just a free ACM Web account.  You can get such an account at http://www.acm.org/account/create.html.
