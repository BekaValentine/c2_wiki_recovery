Something that smells fishy (in code).

Where can a list of (common) BadSmells be found?

I have since had more of a think about this and realise that such a list would be meaningless and impossibly long!

Programmers are lazy by nature and will always take the path of "least resistance".  This invariably means they don't wash and that leads to nasty smells :).

Something may have smelled ''sweet'' when it was first done and subsequently went off.  This just means refactor it.

I am sure if this gets deleted, the page will resurface, because smelliness is used and like me people will want to know if there is a common list....

''It's there already.  See CodeSmell.''


Ahhh...   I thought I had seen it somewhere.  Thanks.
