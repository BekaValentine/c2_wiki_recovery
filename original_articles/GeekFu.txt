A little-known and rarely practiced martial art in which one attacks or defends by exposing the opponent to concepts they are unable to handle, thereby creating sufficient confusion to apply a more conventional secondary attack such as selling them something, or defense, such as running away.

Little is known about the origins of the techniques and they are shrouded in mystery, but some scholars suggest that GeekFu first arose in Athens, Greece around 600BC. There are unconfirmed reports that ThalesOfMiletus first outlined the principles, that Pythagoras made notes of them, but that EuclidOfAlexandria and ArchimedesOfSyracuse were the first true practitioners. It is considered by some that Archimedes' final words, ''don't disturb my circles,'' were part of a last ditch attempt at a GeekFu defense, although we can't be certain. Their writings on the subject haven't survived, and the exact moves and counter-moves they may have used will now never be known.

The practice of GeekFu went through something of a renaissance in the mid 1980's with the first attempts at wearable computing. In this case the technique was purely defensive, acting something like a porcupine's quills and ensuring that none would ever approach too closely. As WearComp became less intrusive so the more subtle forms of the art were discovered until it reached its current form.

There are no recognised schools of GeekFu, and those that practice this ancient skill are hard to find. We can offer no advice other than to watch for the telltale signs. If you can't work them out for yourself, you are unlikely ever to pass beyond simply knowing of the art.
