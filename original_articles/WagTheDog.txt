The President of the United States is about to be accused of sleeping with a girl scout, eleven days before the election. RobertDeNiro is called in as a media expert to distract the public for eleven days, so that the president can get elected for a second term. He hires a movie producer, played by DustinHoffman, to produce a fake war with Albania.

The release of this movie could not possibly have been better timed. It came out, IIRC, right in the middle of the Monica Lewinski mess, ''and'' the beginning of the US involvement in the Balkan Region. The making of the film started before the affair - of course - otherwise it would have been lame.

After watching the movie, one might wonder though, whether Monica Lewinski and the problems in the Balkan Region were not only invented by the publisher to promote the film.

''If Clinton got the US involved in the Balkans to distract attention from the Lewinski scandal...that idea failed miserably.''

This is probably my favourite film of all time now - It creeped into first place when I wasn't looking. There are just so many wonderfully crafted little scenes and pieces of dialogue. Its content is fairly pomo, too, if you like that sort of thing. -- DavidMcNicol

A very nasty movie. Loved it and laughed a lot. --MarkoSchulz

Seems to have inspired the recent WarInIraq...
