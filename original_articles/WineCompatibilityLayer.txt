WINE is not an emulator. It is an OpenSource compatibility layer that aims to host MicrosoftWindows applications without the MS supplied operating system, on a IX host OS such as LinuxOs that executes on the Intel x86 platform.

WINE is not a mechanism to get windows device drivers to work on x86 based UnixOs, doing so would have required previledged access to the processor not made available under WINE.
