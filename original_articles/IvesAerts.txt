I'm an R&D engineer working for Sony, in a group located in Brussels (Belgium). We work on software for digital television sets, according to the DVB MHP specification (see http://www.mhp.org/ )

I got here more or less by accident, while looking for information about code refactoring.

Mmm... I wonder what's in QuickChanges today... :)
