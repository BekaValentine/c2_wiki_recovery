When I started using this wiki I also started describing LOP and THELOP ideas (as an experiment and to keep a promise of documenting them). These ideas are very far from the main stream and only a few people seem to get something out of them. I also suggested to redraw these pages if they aren't appropriate for this wiki, but I wasn't really urged to do so. -- HelmutLeitner
