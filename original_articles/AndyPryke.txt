"Describe AndyPryke here." - that's what it says. Not a simple task, or at least I'd hope its NotAsimpleTask!

AndyPryke. That's me. Programming since 1981, online since 1982. Interested in ExtremeProgramming, better design, Refactoring, teaching.

I have a web page at http://www.andypryke.com

I'm currently (May 2003) working as a contractor for Talis Information Systems. 

I've set up a TwikiClone system at various places I've worked, as an internal knowledge base.

I've also setup a TwikiClone system to allow me to update my personal website ( http://www.AndyPryke.com ) and
also used it for various other website projects.
