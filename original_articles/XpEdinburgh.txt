DATELINE: Edinburgh April 28th 2000.

After 4 years, I'm leaving PanasonicOwl and taking my eXPerience with me :-)

There will now be (at least) two XP projects running in Edinburgh...

	*XpOwl	
	*XpSferics

The old contents of this page have been noved to XpOwl.  That project is still being headed up by AndrewSwan.  I'll start posting results from XpSferics as soon as I join the company :-)
