''Is this a semantic-web markup?''

It's CommonLisp.  I used to have this information here in English, but decided that I cared more about silliness than comprehensibility, at least in this small way.

However, in a sense (neglecting that the term SemanticWeb has a specific meaning) it is a semantic-web markup; the CycMergedOntology uses CommonLisp syntax.  I didnt use the constants it defines here, however.
