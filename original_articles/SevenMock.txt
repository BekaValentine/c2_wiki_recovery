SevenMock is a light-weight dynamic MockObject framework for the JavaLanguage. It is unusual in that it places responsibility for verifying operation parameters directly on the UnitTest code. This enables the test designer to write very clear, precisely targeted tests and makes test failures easier to diagnose.
