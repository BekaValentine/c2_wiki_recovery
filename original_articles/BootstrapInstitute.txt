The Bootstrap Institute (http://www.bootstrap.org -- now moved to http://dougengelbart.org/) has targeted collaborative 
knowledge work as a high-leverage and ''strategic''
first step for aggressive [organizational] improvement...

... Applying these core capabilities in both the product
cycle and the ''improvement cycle'' of the enterprise offers
compounded leverage for 
''bootstrapping organizations into the 21st century''.

-- from the brochure

''What, exactly, does Bootstrap Institute do? The site has always been full of marketing-speak rather than English.''

Management consultants I always thought.
