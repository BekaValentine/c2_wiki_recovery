I hope not.  But there's not much current on it.  Can someone set the record straight?

Squeak is not dead; it is just its website that has been neglected. Here are some resources:

	* Squeak's own swiki at http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak
	* The mailing lists at http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/ - the squeak-dev list is quite active, with 1-2000 messages per month
	* The Squeak People site: http://people.squeakfoundation.org
	* Many squeakers may be seen in the #squeak channel of irc.freenode.net

Also see the SqueakSmalltalk page -- JohnPfersich

And the new squeak.org homepage at http://squeak.org -- DougWay

Squeak is most certainly not dead.  Its mailing list has been getting full of more and more traffic over the years, with more people coding quite a wealth of libraries and useful applications. For me, Squeak is my desktop system, and the support is certainly there when I need it- whether I'm searching the Swiki (go there first, not the squeak.org page!), talking to folks on IRC or asking on the mailing list. In a lot of ways, the Squeak community is quite a bit more supportive than the Python or Perl community- it's smaller, but it's not so unwieldy. It is usually a lot easier to get an answer, even when it's question the Python or Perl folks would just say "read the FAQ, stoopid newbie."  You even have a chance that your question will be answered by Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls or another incredible visionary.

Squeak isn't dead it's just navel-gazing.

[Insert your own Monthy Python style descriptions of the squeak community here]

It must be one heavily lint-ridden navel.  I posted this page a few weeks ago; while the absence of responses doesn't necessarily mean much, I find the lack of Squeak (and/or Smalltalk) activity here and elsewhere disconcerting.  

	* squeak.org: the last entry on "where is squeak headed" is from 2000.  ''Not true any longer... see the new squeak.org website at http://squeak.org.''
	* CREATE Squeak Smalltalk (http://www.create.ucsb.edu/squeak/) page: "stale or obsolete".  Points to squeak.org.
	* link to Squeak Quick Reference at smalltalk.org, marked "New", is dead
	* seems to be no squeak info at UIUC pages

Does anyone have a positive Squeak of the Union address they can provide?

''I'm not a Squeaker, but in the last two years I've heard a fair number of people in the real world (i.e. not online) talking about it. I would think it's just another small niche, where people are active, but not necessarily talking about what they're doing as much as you would think. I thought Forth was dead, until last year, and it turns out I was quite wrong; it's just...niche. But thriving in that niche.''

You might ask is HyperCard(TM) dead...
