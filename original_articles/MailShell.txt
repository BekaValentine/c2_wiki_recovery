A mail service provider that does (so far) a very good job of filtering spam (thus making your e-mail SpamProof), and providing a reliable email service.

Seems there is a pattern in need of a name here :). I'm tempted to quote JackWelch (of GE) about making your back-office someone's front-office. I believe that running your email through an Internet-based service is a good idea.

See SpamCop as a similar service (but much less reliable).
