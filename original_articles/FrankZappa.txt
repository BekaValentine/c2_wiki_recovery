FrankZappa was an influential performance artist who specialized in blistering general parodies of RockMusic style and culture. His musical talents stretched as far as composing (serious) symphonies, and his performance skills stretched as far as playing on a bicycle with drumsticks on an early TeeVee show.

He appeared on the TeeVee show ''The Monkees'', where he pretended to interview Mike Nesmith. His memorable hits included "Suzie Creamcheese", "Dancing Fool", "Cocaine Decisions", and "Valley Girl" (with his daughter Moon Unit on spoken word). I believe there was also a song about not eating yellow snow...

Let us not forget that Zappa also launched the careers of an army of studio musicians and session players. Names like Adrian Belew (King Crimson, etc), Terry Bozzio (Missing Persons, etc), Alice Cooper, Eddy Jobson (UK, etc) [arguably, though he had also worked with Brian Ferry], and many others.

''the crux of the biscuit (this is the dog talking) is the apostrophe''

''Watch out where the huskies go; don't you eat that yellow snow''

''Is that a real poncho, or is that a Sears poncho?''

''Suzie Creamcheese - what's gotten into you?''

''Only fifteen years old, and she knows how to NASTY.''

''Jazz is not dead; it just smells funny''

''I'm so cute!''

''And my balls feel like a pair of maracas...''

"Who are the Brain Police?"
