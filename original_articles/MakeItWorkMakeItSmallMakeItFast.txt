A time tested optimization pattern.

* First, make the code do what it is supposed to do.  Do not try to optimize for size or speed yet.  DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.
* Second, reduce redundancy.  Refactoring common code to a common location is easier once the code works, harder after it has been optimized for performance.  OnceAndOnlyOnce.
* Third, optimize execution time.  ProfileBeforeOptimizing.
