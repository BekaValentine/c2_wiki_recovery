After looking at the PersonalWiki page and downloading some of the wikis, DanParks decided he could do more with less. So he sat down and hacked out some Perl code...and ended up with ''sk'', a (very) simple wiki.

''sk'''s claims to fame are:
* resizable textareas! - editing has never been so easy
* WikiWords are the only syntax - everything else is plain text or your own HTML
* simple installation - just one (rather small, I might add) Perl script and a few CSS/JavaScript/PNG files
* few dependencies - you don't need anthing more than the core Perl distribution, plus the page storage is on the filesystem
* tested and working under multiple web servers (Apache, IIS, and even PWS to date)

However, ''sk'' might not be for you if you require:
* page versioning
* "safety" from JavaScript in the wiki
* user login and tracking

Download ''sk'' from http://www.eastofcleveland.com/sk_info.pl?name=DownloadSK, or try out the sandbox at http://www.eastofcleveland.com/sk_sandbox.pl.

More info about sk is available at http://www.eastofcleveland.com/sk_info.pl.

I take it you need to run a WebServer, even when all you want is a PersonalWiki? ''Yes.''

''This is generally not a problem.  It belongs to a general category of statements of the form, "I need to run <x>, when all I want is a <y>?"  You can replace <x> and <y> with "DBMS" and "accounting software", "operating system" and "word processor," "a Web browser" and "document viewer," and so on.  As even the smallest platforms increase in capacity and power (mobile phones and PDAs, for example), the need for <x>s to run <y>s increases developer productivity (because no wheels need be re-invented) with minimal user impact.''
