I am primarily a Perl developer but work in Java in my day (paying) job. I have developed an ObjectRelationalMapping tool in Perl called SPOPS and a web application server called OpenInteract. Fun stuff. Currently I'm working on a fairly large project using the JbossServer and trying to be thoughtful about design up front while still GettingThingsDone.

I set up a Wiki (using TWiki) at work to deal with everyone's learning curve with patterns, OO programming and Java (from a VisualBasic and SQL background), so you could probably consider me a budding WikiAddict.
