'' There seem to be a lot of us.  I'm separating my own original entry from the individual citations that followed, to make this slightly more understandable. -- Daniel Church (of College Park, Maryland, USA)''

Just got here from http://alsa.opensrc.org and I was instantly amazed... I saw documentation, precious knowledge, and opinions on a site with a link saying "Edit this page".  I didn't understand how something like this could work, no registration or usernames or anything.  It certainly works, though... and I've gotten hooked on it.

I saw something similar at EverythingTwo, but this is just so much more relaxed.  I've already bookmarked a few edits I want to make (decided to write my own HomePage first, though), and I have to say I'm truly impressed.

Oh, and I've found myself tangenting more heavily than I could have expected through WikiWiki, and I often find myself hitting Back ten to twelve times just to get back to what I was originally reading, if not forget about it entirely... anyone else HaveThisPattern?

''(Yeah, I made myself a TreeBrowse tool http://siggma.net/treebrowse -- StijnSanders)''

''and about yourself . . .''

Right, right... I put this up with no sleep whatsoever, let's try this again.

I am a ComputerScience major at the University of Maryland, College Park.  I program mostly in CeeLanguage, PhpLanguage, and ToolCommandLanguage (TclTk), on whatever personal projects look interesting to me, of which there are many.

And in other news, I've created my own WikiWikiWeb out of a combination of boredom, PhpLanguage, and a need for a good artwork forum.  It's not as fully-featured as this one, but it seems to work at its job, i.e. creating a space for artists to display their work and get comments on it.  It also has a few restrictions on what parts of it can be edited.  I'd love some comments on it; if anyone has the time, visit FlouriWiki and let me know (or even better, leave comments) what you think of it.
