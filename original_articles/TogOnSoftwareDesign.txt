''Excerpt from the book's home page (http://www.asktog.com):''

Tog on Software Design discusses the evolution computers will undergo in the coming decade, and the impact these changes will have on society as a whole. You'll find lively, thought-provoking essays on topics from quality management to the meaning of standards, to corporate structure and cooperation, interspersed with responses to queries supplied by designers and developers.

This book did not live up to my expectations after reading TogOnInterface.  Oh well.
