GnomeMeeting is a software tool for people who use Gnome to communicate over the net.  There exists other tools that does the same, like VirtualNetworkComputing and NetMeeting. GnomeMeeting was renamed to Ekiga in 2005.

It can be used for VirtualPairProgramming. It seems like a good way to PropagateXp.

GnomeMeeting is the videophone of the GnomeDesktopEnvironment, like NetMeeting is the videophone of MicrosoftWindows. In other words, it generally does the same thing for the GnomeDesktopEnvironment as NetMeeting does for MicrosoftWindows.  One thing it doesn't do yet though, is to share desktop, for that you want to use VirtualNetworkComputing. (YouCanImproveMyEnglish).

According to http://www.gnomemeeting.org/index.php?rub=3&pos=0&faqpage=x53.html#AEN59 GnomeMeeting can even interact with NetMeeting.

GnomeMeeting lives at http://www.gnomemeeting.org, where one will find links to screenshots and download.  There is one problem with GnomeMeeting though, it will not work OutOfTheBox without soundhardware.
