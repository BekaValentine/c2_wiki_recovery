The '''Great Place to Work® Trust Index©''', is an employee survey tool that measures the level of trust, pride, and camaraderie within your workplace, provided by the GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute.

I wonder if this index has a tendency to make employees think more positively about their employers?  For example, in the page that describes the Trust index, one can read that "Consists of 58 statements that cover credibility, respect, fairness, pride, and camaraderie" also "The 58 positively worded statements fall into one of the five dimensions of the Model" positively worded... I wonder what the results would be if they were negatively worded...?

It also reads "contains two open-ended questions which allow employees to express, in their own words, what makes their company great".  I wonder if the final result would be greatly affected if the two open-ended questions were to "allow employees to express, in their own words, what makes their company lame"...?  Would asking the questions from a negative/pessimistic light affect a lot the results?  Would it be better to offer both kinds of questions randomly to the employees?
