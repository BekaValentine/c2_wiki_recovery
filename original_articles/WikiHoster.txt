WikiHoster.net (http://www.wikihoster.net/) offers hosting for private and public wikis. However implementing and maintaining wikis as well as training for wiki users are provided on request, too. WikiHoster.net was founded on March 25, 2011 which was the 16. WikiBirthday. The farm is run by KarstenHoffmeyer.

The wikis use the MediaWiki WikiEngine. Pricing is 8 EUR/month for the standard regular plan and 20 EUR/month for the standard semantic plan. The semantic plan includes SemanticMediaWiki and makes use of the advantages of the SemanticWikiWikiWeb.

The wikis are backed up daily and receive regular upgrading as maintenance or security releases of MediaWiki become available. Every six months the wikis are upgraded to the newer available branch of MediaWiki. These services are included in the hosting service without extra charge.

The most prominent customers are StadtwikiKarlsruhe (http://ka.stadtwiki.net/Hauptseite - de / http://en.ka.stadtwiki.net/Main_Page - en), the world's biggest city wiki which exists since September 2004 as well as Jewiki, the world's biggest German language wiki about Jewish topics which exists since March 2011.
