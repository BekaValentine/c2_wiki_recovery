Set aside one day every couple of weeks or so (one day per increment, if you are using ExtremeProgramming style ShortIncrements) as a code review day. Spend the morning doing CodeWalkthrough's, and in the afternoon each developer fixes the errors found in the AM. This worked well on my last project. -- RobertEikel
