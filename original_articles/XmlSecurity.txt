XmlSecurity is the name of a book ISBN:0072193999. ''Unix Review'' said it is better suited for implementation and troubleshooting ExtensibleMarkupLanguage security matters than SecureXml (ISBN:0201756056). The latter book is said to be better for developers, with more in-depth code examples.

'''Developer resources related to securing XML applications'''

Any useful links?

Both books are 2002 published. Any significant XML security developments not addressed by these books?

What OpenSource tools have good support for developing XML applications that are reasonably secure?

Any advice for people wanting to tackle XmlSecurity using VbClassic accessible tools?
