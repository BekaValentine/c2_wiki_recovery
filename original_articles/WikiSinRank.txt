How would you rank the following Wiki Sins? (WikiWeightedVote)

1. Altering content attributed to (signed by) other WikiZens (''excluding'' grammar/spelling fixes and ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode refactorings). [9 8 8]

2. Deleting on-topic content [7 5 8]

3. Duplication of ideas [4 2 3]

4. Putting material in the wrong topic [2 1 3]

5. Creating off-topic (non-computer-related) topics or content [4 7 6]

6. ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode refactorings [0 -9]

I am curious to see how others would rank these "wiki sins". I rank them 1,2,4,3,5 (first is worse). I would be harder on number 3, but feel that the current wiki is not designed for a small enough granularities to factor properly. -- top

I would agree on 1 & 2, tie 3 & 5, and put 4 last. I base this mostly on how hard it is to fix each "sin". 1 is outright unethical, and impossible to catch once someone has touched the page. 2 is a pain unless it's caught immediately, but can usually be rectified. Duplication of ideas isn't hard to deal with in principle, but often times the duplication is hard to catch and hard to merge. Off-topic spawns huge ThreadMess that's usually impossible to refactor; it's a TimeSink without much payoff. Putting material in the wrong topic is no problem; just go put it in the right topic.

Let's turn this into a WikiWeightedVote. You know the drill; 0-9, 9 is worst, each vote is one digit. -- JonathanTang

I think 2) needs a bit more context. I assume it's meant as "Deleting on-topic content as an act of vandalism, personal attack, or disagreement", but there are also many instances where deletion of on-topic content occurs for good reasons (collapsing duplicated or near-duplicated content, thread mode conversion, etc.). Assuming nobody has any objections, shall we add this to the definition?

I've also added ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode as its own item. I see it as a cardinal virtue; Robert sees it as a cardinal sin. Let's see what others think.

After you tally your sins, do your WikiPenance.
