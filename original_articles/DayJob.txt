The DayJob is one's "regular" employment, typified by PointyHairedBoss(es), a CorporateCulture, and people who get paid more for your work than you do.

----

All your jobs are belong to us.

As a committed WageSlave, I resemble that remark!

Of course, although we may gripe and complain about our DayJob, at the same time we are infinitely happy that we were able to obtain one -- just try living without one!  God bless the people that give us our DayJob.

At the same time, however, always remember that it is /just/ your DayJob and not your RealJob.  Your RealJob is the work that you do to advance the value of the things that you own (your body, your reputation, or your own business, for example).

When you become exceedingly successful, you can create gnarly DayJobs for other people :-)
