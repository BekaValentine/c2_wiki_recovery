Michael Chermside is a fairly new visitor to this place. He'll improve his page as he goes along. Or maybe he won't... these days he rarely hangs out here. Please put any comments for him on this page anyway. You can also see his blog at http://mcherm.com/

He was much noisier when he first came to Wiki, but then calmed down now, did more reading than writing. Later he mostly abandoned the place. But not completely. In his spare (non programming) time, he likes to play RolePlayingGame''''''s.

'''Notes on Wikki'''

It seemed like a good idea to use this page as a place for storing my own
personal notes ABOUT Wikki. Or at least it seemed like a good idea at the
time. After trying it for a while, I may get rid of it.
