'''Context:''' Wiki Forum with a lot of highly creative people
more or less well integrated into the WikiWay.

'''Forces:'''
people  are forced to put their most qualified activities to their employers or their own business. Otherwise their love for free Wiki interactions could be seen by their employers as a distraction. 

'''Problem:''' How can people engage themselves in Wiki , such that their WikiWay can be successfully extended to a WikiWayOfLife.

'''Solution:''' WikiWayOfLifeSolution this is only a marker for follow-ups

'''Resulting Context:''' Wiki Forum with a lot of people earning their income, better integrated into the WikiWay.

'''Examples:'''
	* OnlinePublishing 
	* Employed people who strive for a WikiWayOfLife could get the permission of their employers for a full time Wiki engagement, because publicly helping other people to develop themselves is the best PR for a company in the Web.

I'm confused: Is this just written up in the style of a pattern  or is it really a pattern?

ThankYou some guy, it's wonderful, if social intelligence can learn from
software intelligence and vice versa. I just try
DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork , I think it has a good chance to
become a best use pattern for people who love Wiki.

Slow down there Fridemar, you're confusing us. We're not as smart as you are. 

	* What does DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork have to do with muddying pattern forms? 
	* What's with all the weirdo {} and [] brackets that get stuck on pages you edit - is your browser doing something most browsers don't do? Or is this another stylistic convention you'd like to propagate here? If so, what does it mean?

I suspect it might pay you to start with the way wiki works now, suggest your innovations one at a time, and let the now very well established community here see whether they'd like to adopt any of them. GoWithTheGrain. Otherwise you may find more people reacting against you than working with you. That too is WhyWikiWorks. --PeterMerel

Thank you Peter, you got me :-)
 
No, I won't play the smart guy. This role is something for masochists. I love
it feeling good and enjoy it if other people feel good. Unfortunately I often
miss the target.
 
I used the pattern form, because it seems to me a good (refinable :-) form
for presenting a proposed solution to a known problem. I hope that nice guys
of the pattern community will help to make it a real pattern. (I think at
moment you would call it a ProtoPattern.) For my part I intend to deliver a
practical experimental solution with starting the DataMusicProject within a
Wiki community. 
 
If the weird brackets lessen your good feeling, I'll try harder to avoid them.
