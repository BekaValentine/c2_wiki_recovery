This is a recipe for a sandwich called ''' '' The Good One '' '''

The reason a food recipe is found in this repository is that it has been 
thought out using a DesignPattern. I have coined the pattern in question as 
the DailyValuesPattern. To find out more about the USDA daily values go to
http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/foodlabel/dvs.html and to find out more about
how the daily values are applied to day to day life go to
http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/fdnewlab.html 

This is just another good example of how DesignPatterns permeates all facets of 
human kind's daily existence.

''The Good One''

* Two table spoons of low fat cottage cheese
* Spinach leaves to taste
* Four slices of Roma tomatoes
* A thin slice of a purple onion
* Three slices of smoked turkey lunch meat
* One table spoon of coarse deli mustard
* Two slices of 100% Whole Wheat bread (toasted)
* Salt and pepper to taste

Spread the cottage cheese across the bottom piece of toast in the sandwich 
stack. Salt and pepper the cottage cheese to taste. I use a blend of garlic
salt to give it a zing. Place the spinach leaves on top of the cottage cheese.
Place the slices of Roma tomatoes on top of the spinach. Place the onion slices
on top of the tomatoes. Add the slices of lunch meat on top of the stack. I use
smoked turkey breast lunch meat, however any equally low-fat, high-protein 
compost will do (e.g. roast beef). Spread the mustard on the top slice of bread
and place it on top of the sandwich stack (mustard facing down). I usually 
slice the sandwich in half before serving to ease consumption... and there you
have it... ''The Good One!''

Here is the breakdown for the meal above where the percentages are your Daily 
Values:

* Calories: 245
** Calories from Fat: 30
* Cholesterol: 20mg 3%
* Sodium: 1g 45%
* Carbohydrates: 25g 10%
** Fiber: 6g 27%
** Sugar: 6g
* Protein: 25g

The meal above is a very significant source of vitamin A containing 100% of 
one's Daily Value. It is also a significant source of Iron, Vitamin C, Folic
Acid, and Calcium.

So according to the DailyValuesPattern you have got yourself a low-fat, high-
fiber meal that is what the doctor ordered for those long programming hours
and may just save you from osteoporosis... and hence the name ''' '' The Good One '' '''

seems kind of high in salt -- JamesKeogh

Maybe the sodium percentage is a misprint, or maybe it's from the "smoked" meat. -- ElizabethWiethoff
