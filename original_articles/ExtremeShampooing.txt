ExtremeShampooing is the latest professional hairdressing methodology!

Through continual testing of hair texture and softness to minimize split ends, and pair lathering to ensure each strand has at least one pair of eyes examining it, every hair on your head will enjoy faster, more reliable results. Period. ExtremeShampooing has seen decades of practice in the shower stalls of couples across the world, all of whom can attest to its viability in the marketplace. Advanced ExtremeShampooing techniques include alternation of several different shampoo brands or products between styling iterations, and often products are exchanged within a single pair lathering session.

Don't hesitate. Bring ExtremeShampooing into your lifestyle today!

''I don't like the waterfall technique. Better to OnceAndOnlyOnce your head by shaving it.''

Nope, you have to reshave. Better to use electrolysis.

''Darn. Can I just put my hair in a RevisionControlSystem and check out old version when I need them?''

I like that idea.. then I can go back to pre-gray and not be called an OldFart so often. But at least I have hair!

'''Tip:''' Pick a partner that you get along with. This can help you avoid situations that may end up in an evidentiary hearing.
