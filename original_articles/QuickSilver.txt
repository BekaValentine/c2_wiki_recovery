Please bear in mind that this book is almost completely fantasy. In particular the supposed toings and froings of I. Newton and the R. Society are nonsensified, as are most of the politics and political figures. A '''much''' better book, if you really want to learn about the period, is TheCreationOfTheModernWorld by RoyPorter. Both are rollicking good reads.
