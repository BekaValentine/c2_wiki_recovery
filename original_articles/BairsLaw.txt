'''Don't ask a question unless you want to hear the answer.'''

----

This law, initially formulated by Charles Bair, relates to the more famous but less clear "It's easier to say sorry than ask for permission".

----

The law's applicability is quite broad. Consider here some questions that shouldn't be asked unless you want to hear the answer:
* Honey, do I look fat to you?
* Can I go to the mall?
* Boss, can we do ExtremeProgramming?
* Do you want the last pork chop?
* What did you buy me for my birthday?

This rule of thumb came up in a fairly good Paul Newman movie, _The Verdict_ as advice to a trial lawyer. I think it was expressed in the movie as "Don't ask a question you don't already know the answer to," regarding questioning a witness on the stand.

A public defender I know disregarded that advice, to good effect:

''Defense: Given the complainant's age and weight, if she had drunk as much as she claims, would she have been competent at 1:00 AM?''

''Prosecution Expert Witness: No, she would definitely not have been competent.''

''Defense (fishing): What would have been her condition at, say, 3:00 AM?''

''Expert (consulting table): She would have been dead.''

Maybe a better rule would be: Don't coach your witnesses to give implausible testimony.

I first heard this law from Admiral GraceHopper, one of Cobol's founders as such:  
'''It is easier to get forgiveness than permission.'''

p.s. Who was Baird?
