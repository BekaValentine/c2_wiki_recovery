A feature of the latest version of MozillaFirefox allowing you to automatically add RssFeeds to your bookmarks.

For example (using our NewRecentChanges) go to http:RecentChanges and notice the little orange RSS icon in the browser's status bar. Hit that icon, select "Subscribe," and save the bookmark somewhere (the Toolbar is a nice place). When you click on that bookmark, you'll find a long list of recently-changed pages.

'''Warning about resource usage'''

see http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/index.php?p=776 suggests this feature hogs server resource.
* OTOH maybe I should create an entry in LiveBookmarks for scam sites that I accidentally fall for

I have found LiveBookmarks not needed after I have added SAGE RssViewer addon to MozillaFirefox. Maybe it has its place and I was just too lazy to climb the learning curve. -- dl
