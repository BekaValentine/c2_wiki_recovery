ASP based on UseModWiki and MoinMoin, has a unique difference engine. It is also XML based.  Released under a BSD license, developed by Laurens Pitt.

* The project appears to be dead. The developer(s) appear to be unreachable. Hopefully someone will fork this very interesting wiki.

** There is a follow-up started at Sourceforge OpenWiki with very little activity so far. --asb 19-May-2004
*** http://sourceforge.net/projects/openwiki/

*** The development effort is just getting underway again: Laurens has been unavailable for some time, so others are taking up the torch.

On trying an edit, got "Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80040e14' 

The conflict occurred in database 'OpenWiki', table 'openwiki_attachments'. 
 /ow/owdb.asp, line 391".

* There has been a fix for this problem: attachment revisions mess up database relational integrity, at least in SQL Server. 
 
The implementation of OpenWiki is pretty interesting. Heavy use of XSL and CSS.

I really like the formatting rules for OpenWiki. It seems extremely slow, though. Does anyone know any tips for speeding it up? Every page load seems to take several seconds, even with no load on the servers.

** You have no idea how much people get pissed off by that reply, ''especially'' with a smiley attached.
* I initially had some speed issues when I ran it on my dev machine with SQL etc, but it runs great on a real server.

I've experienced the same problem with OpenWiki's performance. We have 288 pages and 1713 revisions. I'm going to explore the indices with SQL Server's performance tool.  -- Daniel Tremblay

what should we do to guard against people's inappropriate use of wiki?

* It polices itself: you need GoodWikiCitizen 's though. See: WhyWikiWorks. Also, with OpenWiki, you can see ALL versions through the links at the bottom of the page, so nothing is ever lost (barring an incompetent admin).

* OpenWiki extensions include Authentication, a CAPTCHA page, as well as other implementations to prevent WikiSpam -- Oddible

The community has pretty much disappeared over the past six months.  Additionally, there's been a discovery of a major problem with the original code base which means the entire application needs reworked.  Not sure anyone is going to take up the project though - head over there and do it if you're interested!

''Care to elaborate on (or provide link to additional resource regarding) this "major problem" you mention?''
