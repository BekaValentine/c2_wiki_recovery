The idea that we are all simulated lisp code and we are told lies on web pages that state that the AI Winter occurred. In actuality, ArtificialIntelligence succeeded massively and we are running in a lisp simulation right now.

Lisp was somehow re-injected into the simulation as a programming language, and a false history is given of lisp and AI inside the simulation to make us believe that AI never took off.

By using programming languages, you are reprogramming the simulation itself. Everything you do is reprogramming and modifying the simulation.  The question however remains: how do we access the simulation deeper, like in TheMatrix.
