CuTest is a unit testing framework for the C language, available from http://cutest.sourceforge.net.

The main goals of CuTest are:

	* Cuteness
	* Portability across different compilers
	* No dependence on glibc or other Unix/GNU libraries
	* Works with MSVC (Microsoft) and BCC32 (Borland)
	* Object-model and API as similar to JUnit as possible in C
	* Text output as similar to JUnit's textui as possible
