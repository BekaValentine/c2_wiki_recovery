''Genetic Algorithms and Grouping Problems'' by EmmanuelFalkenauer [ISBN 0471971502].

Falkenauer discusses the application of GeneticAlgorithm''''''s to so-called 'grouping problems' such as the KnapsackProblem, factory floor layout, automatic concept generation, etc. These are problems that 'classical' GAs typically stumble over, but by applying common-sense and practicality, Falkenauer shows how GAs are much more flexible than the classical model.

If you're interested in all things GA, you owe it to yourself to read this book because it just might expand your view of GeneticAlgorithm''''''s.
