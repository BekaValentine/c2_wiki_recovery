''InterWiki Pages '' -- ThinkingOutLoud DonaldNoyes 20071006

A scheme for personalWikis which would facilitate p2pInterWiki:
----
The local personalWikiServer would have a process called SisterSites 
* which would access, record, store and process
** readOnlyPages
*** with the dateTime the sisterSiteInfo was last updated
*** the url for the site including reference to a preferred InterWikiPrefix
*** for information about the sisterSite called administrationFrontPage which would spell out sitePolicy, siteAccess, informationForNewUsers, and other such pages which would aid users of the SisterSites
*** its InterWikiLogo
** sisterSiteInfo which would include list of the sites which are considered SisterSites, which maintain some requiredFiles such as links to
*** the SisterSite PageList (readOnly) which would be a flat text file of the list of the names of wikiPages with each pageName being followed by a list of the ForwardLinks it contains
*** a page at each site for communication with its siteAdministrator called notesToAdministration
