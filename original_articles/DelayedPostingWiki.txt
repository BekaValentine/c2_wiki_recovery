I have seen on numerous sites edits delayed for a couple of minutes, hours so that an editor reads it and allows its posting. Could that be a solution to this wiki's problems? -- Nicolas
* ''That is a solution that has been proposed in the past, but it was never implemented for various reasons.''

On the other hand, I'd like to post a technical question on this wiki. Where can I do so? Thanks!
* ''Usually, the way to ask a question is on a page that the question relates to. Or, you can simply create a new page (like you have done with this one) with your question, and most likely someone will address it.''
* There are also some pages for questions, like QuickQuestions, NewUserQuestions, and WikiWikiWebFaq. Also backlinks from CategoryWikiHelp. Also, you could find a page about your topic of interest, and post a question there. (Good style is to put the question in another section separated by ---- and prefixed with '''Q:'''.)

''Please delete this page after you are finished with it.  Simply replace all text with the single word "delete" without the quotation marks. Thanks!''

Could this page be kept so that users could provide some feedback on delayed posting? -- Nicolas
* ''Well, we can see what happens, I guess.''
* please remove this discussion when read.

''Discussion''

I was told that this wiki was managed by a few managers -I forgot how they were called. Since they are a lot of them, the control of edits could be shared between them. I find this wiki very interesting but most of the good contents is diluted in a sea of weird interactions with a machine thus making the reading from Recent Changes close to impossible.
With delayed posting, the good stuff would be kept and the bad rejected (including the spam). --Nicolas

''This wiki has "stewards".''

''As far as the argument for managers approving each edit, I disagree.  I'd much prefer a simple username/password login.  Spammers can then be blocked.  You can't avoid all spammers, but you ''can'' raise the bar for entry and make ridding booting them easier.''

''But neither you nor I are going to see many changes to this wiki codebase.''

DelayedEditing is a good idea and it has been proposed before, but it seems not to be in the spirit of this wiki. And it would place a too high burden on the stewards. I think Ward has no problem with the disturbances you notice. I think this is because they are a kind of creative input and if you don't like it you are free to build something onto it or do something else against it. And if nobody does so probably the content - or rather the process forming it - is not worth it. -- JustMe

In regards to: ''"thus making the reading from Recent Changes close to impossible"'' try using NewRecentChanges, easiest used through the quick links on BulldonTerrier'''''''s HomePage.

'''Recent Changes'''

There is too much noise on Recent Changes: there is this guy who never stops correcting and a sort of robot that counters him. There are all sorts of spam. I get very discouraged and I give up. Ward is a big fan of the status quo and he seems to react to problems 5 years later. The truth is this site is slowly going down but Ward doesn't seem to notice. He might need a new pair of glasses. Or a lecture by stewards. Something. Anything. Delayed posting is a great solution. It will filter the good wheat from the shaff and put this site back on its feet. --Sinisalo 

''Yes. And therefore...?''

And therefore it should be strongly recommended to Ward by stewards and by users. You couldn't find a better and simpler solution to this wiki's problems. 

''Agreed! There is always a trade-off to be made in life. Here giving up wiki s immediacy but in exchange having a readable and user-friendly wiki would be a very profitable compromise. The bot now controls this wiki. It<s a shame! I heard however that the webmaster does not take any decisions or has problems taking efficient decisions therefore we re back to square one. Bad management always ends up killing wikis and forums. Too bad! Can,t stewards reason with the webmaster and bring him back to reality^'' (HARRY S)
