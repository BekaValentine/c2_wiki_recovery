According to Dr. Johnny Fever (''WKRP in Cincinnati'', see TvShow) a Constitutional right.

And a common point of discrimination against SoftwareDeveloper''''''s, since most
companies provide free coffee, but only supply vending machines for caffeinated sodas

''No. Those people are SoftDrinkDevelopers.''

Mh'hanngg!???  Are you diss'n my MountainDew!?????   :-)

''It is dangerous to antagonize Dew drinkers, for it is very hard to predict what a mind afloat in so much caffeine might do under stress.''

We have free fountain drinks until 2:30. -- DavidBrantley

''Do you have a good dental plan?'' -- Dr. Gary Null

At least one company, Qsent Inc, supplies free soda and junk food vending machines as well as free coffee, hot chocolate, bottled water.
----
NuMega provides free coffee, including cappucino, espresso and more. Hot chocolate. Fridges full of every type of caffeinated beverages. Bottled water too. And the famous 3pm daily DevSnack - food that only a geek could like -)

MicroSoft was, once upon a time, famous for its free soft drinks, fizzy water, juice, milk, and probably coffee. You had to be quick with the chocolate milk, though -- the summer interns would have it gone in the time between 'fridge refill (5pm) and the time they went home in the evening...

Gee, I always figured that the huge gobs of money the client was paying me could cover any soft drinks or coffee I needed to consume during the day...are you saying I've been mistreated all this time? Garsh! -- MartySchrader

''Not mistreated, but discriminated against.  Coffee drinkers get their beverage for free, but those of us who prefer coffee only as aromatherapy must pay for our caffiene.'' --PeteHardie

One former employer provided free softdrinks via a soda fountain.  Soda fountains are much cheaper and more efficient than vending machines and it gave us all the opportunity to learn how soda fountains work. We also had the rare opportunity (with minor modifications) to taste the bliss that is carbonated Hawaiian Punch.  This employer also provided FreeLunch, which was a great way to get people from different teams socializing in the same room.

"...carbonated Hawaiian Punch."  ''That was my first impression of MountainDew Code Red.  Gimme the green.

Nah.  HP-CO2 has no caffeine and more acid than any soft drink I've had.  It burns.  Not for the faint of heart.

Are we talking about free CoffeeFlavoredCoffee?  Or the gourmet expensive stuff?

We have Free Coffee in our office and it is worth every penny (-:

In my HomeOffice, Coffee costs a lot less than the gasoline it takes many to drive a couple of blocks toward their CorporateOffice. It is expensive to work away from Home! Now if Companies offered FreeGasoline, that would be something significant! -- DonaldNoyes

I find it worrisome that we're arguing about free soda, coffee and junk food, whereas healthier alternatives aren't mentioned at all.  Free fruit, for example.  I know, I know, shelf-life issues.  But what percentage of vending-machine goods in your office won't result in a sugar crash an hour later?  --NickBensema

Health issues should not be based on what is free, but upon what is GoodThing with regard to your health. The BrownBag is a good container for carrying such healthy things to work from your home, however if you are at your HomeOffice, the healthy items are always accessible. -- DonaldNoyes

Some healthier alternatives are mentioned on ThereMustBeWhatKindOfFood. See also TheExtremeProgrammingDiet
