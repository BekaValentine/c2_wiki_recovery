A TimeAndMaterialContract obliges a consumer to pay a supplier a certain negotiated rate during the execution of a (usually development) project. The TimeAndMaterialContract places the majority of the risk on the consumer, and generally has a lower price (at the outset) than its FixedPriceContract counterpart.
