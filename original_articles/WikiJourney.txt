On first discovering the concept of Wiki the neophyte begins the search for more instances of Wiki, discovering in the process that Wikiness is not constrained to Wiki. There are many other Wiki like experiences. Thus begins the addiction and the search for an ever better Wiki. This has led me to Tiki which I shall be installing over the next few days.
