LazyInheritance would be the pattern of letting methods (once) appropriate to given circumstances be inherited to new/later circumstances (subclasses) without properly considering if they in fact are appropriate in the new situation. This happens because the person(s) concerned take something for granted that is not necessarily (always) true. The thought was raised in Y2K sideissue in YouArentGonnaNeedIt. -- BoLeuf
