I'm from Scandinavia, Denmark, where I graduated as Datamatician in May, 2000.

My personal interests are broad and include ExtremeProgramming, DesignPatterns and patterns in general, OperatingSystems, SoftwareEngineering, SoftwareDevelopment infused with ComputerScience, ProgrammingLanguage''''''s, ProgrammingIdiom''''''s, ModelsOfComputation. TestFirstProgramming and PairProgramming have become important to me.

Other interests are Philosophy, Neurology, CognitivePsychology, Religion, Theoretical Physics, Psychiatry, Literature, Mythology, History, Linguistics, Semantics and Mathematics. O! I am also very fond of all kinds of different music, as long as it's not too mainstream ;-) My favourite writer, Erwin Neutzsky-Wulff (http://enw.dk), talks about all of it resembling "a modern John Frazier" in quite a unique way. -- DennisDeckerJensen
