Let's play the PatternDictionaryGame!

Here's how it is played:
	1 Get a large dictionary
	1 Gather bored developer(s).
	1 For single points, pick 1 random word, and describe how that word could be a pattern(anti's are ok)
	1 For double points, pick 2 random words, join them together, and describe how both orderings could be an architecture/model(anti's are ok)
	1 For triple points, pick 3 random words, join them together, and describe how (any)three orderings could be a methodology/technique
	1 If playing in a group, everyone votes(not for themselves) - the best one wins that round.

example: Two random words: ''Postage'' and ''Tender''

So two names for an architecture: TenderPostage and PostageTender
* TenderPostage: A delayable messaging system that uses CRC's and redundancy to both validate messages and reconstruct if necessary
* PostageTender: A messaging system that charges micropayments upon delivery

another example: Three random words: ''Biding'', ''Lizard'', and ''Cosy''

So three names for a methodology/technique: CosyBidingLizard, BidingLizardCosy, and. . how about LizardCosyBiding
*CosyBidingLizard: A developer technique of cosily biding one's time to implement something, because the environment affects the inertia(cold-blooded)
*BidingLizardCosy: A place to put files that come at random interval from an untrusted source.
*LizardCosyBiding: When a developer tries underhanded techniques at making other developers comfortable with waiting to implement something

(I'm not saying these are great, just examples)
