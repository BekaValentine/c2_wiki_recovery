I've been climbing the CsharpLanguage learning curve (which so far is quite gentle), and I'm hitting a roadblock at CsharpClosures.

What is the CsharpLanguage idiom, syntax, or convention regarding DeferredExecution?

* JavaLanguage has AnonymousInnerClass''''''es.
* SmalltalkLanguage has blocks.
* Lisp has closures or continuations.
* CsharpLanguage 1.0 has delegates, which bind together a method/object pair
* CsharpLanguage 2.0 introduces AnonymousMethod''''''s, which are similar to Scheme lambdas and are true lexical closures
* CsharpLanguage 3.0 introduces a new compact syntax for LambdaExpression''''''s as well as a Lisp-style quoting scheme called expression trees
