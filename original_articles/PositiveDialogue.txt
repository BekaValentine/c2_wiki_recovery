Positive Dialogue
* Is based on the ability of the those involved in dealing with ideas and actions to realize that if they are to enjoy harmony and make mutual progress they must be agreable that an exchange can improve situations and possibilities of the several sides by concentrating on what will yield a win-win result. This is contrasted by approaches which are typified by hostile disagreement and opposition which widen the gap and end up creating a win-lose or a lose-lose results.
*Admits that acceptable ideas and acceptable actions are more powerful in realizing results  than are weapons and stances designed to coerce compliance by imposing by way of position or through the exercise of power.
