'''Note: page last modified in 2001. I think when GenerationX becomes TooOld, they will also put their hands up and exclaim ''AnythingGoes'' '''

Quotes from philosopher PaulFeyerabend (AgainstMethod).

		'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold...but the terrified
		exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history.

		...

		The only principle which does not inhibit progress is: anything
		goes.		

And from philosopher ColePorter:
   Times have changed
   And we've often rewound the clock
   Since the Puritans got a shock
   When they landed on Plymouth Rock.
   If today, any shock they should try to stem,
   'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,
   Plymouth Rock would land on them.

   In olden days a glimpse of stocking
   Was looked on as something shocking
   Now heaven knows, anything goes

   Good authors too who once knew better words
   Now only use four letter words writing prose
   Anything goes

   The world has gone mad today
   And good's bad today
   And black's white today
   And day's night today
   When most guys today that women prize today
   Are just silly gigolos

   So though I'm not a great romancer
   I know that you're bound to answer
   When I propose, anything goes

   The world has gone mad today 
   And good's bad today, 
   And black's white today, 
   And day's night today, 
   And that gent today 
   You gave a cent today 
   Once had several chateaux. 
   When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
   Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
   Lack baby clo'es, 
   Anything goes.
