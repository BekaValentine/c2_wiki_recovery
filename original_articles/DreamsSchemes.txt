''Guess what? Some more ideas'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110914

Here is a Notion: Can we have a page or pages where you could list dreams, schemes and potential innovations, either already posted, or being born and thus WantedPages? This would qualify as OnTopic, by becoming a Project about Software or Hardware which involves Programmers. With it and such things as personal and corporate altruism, IdeasForImplementation could be offered as OpenInitiative''''''s, with the potential of making the world a better place, one ActOfRandomKindness at a time. There are many reasons this would be a GoodThing and very few which would make it a BadThing.
