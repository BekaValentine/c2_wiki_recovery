If your thing is button-pushing and flicking images on the tiny hand-held phone or tablet (10 inches is tiny now-a-days) and you want to see things on a larger display and yet retain the ability to see several things, except instead of serializing your display, you can window them and then zoom in and out of the several views by using the 40, 50, 60 or 90 inch TV you may have in your living room. The added benefit is that others with you can share your experience without having to crowd around, looking over your shoulder. 

What this page is calling for is apps which will allow you to do this with ease.
