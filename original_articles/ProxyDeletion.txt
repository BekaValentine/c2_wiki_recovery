A flaw in this Wiki's deletion technique.

To delete a page without anyone's help:
* Replace the contents with "delete"
* then: Use a web proxy to second the "delete"

Result: Page is now gone, the deletion seemed to have community support, and chaos is increased because it's difficult to see why it was deleted.

Also: Don't forget to pretend you are a gnome (never mind that gnomes don't delete pages unless they are spam/empty).

''Don't forget, now that I shared the tip about how to restore your UserName, I can use 217.137's technique and simply change my name to double edit a page like he always does. No need to burn two proxies at once.''
* Hrm. Using an IP, then a UserName allows a seconded deletion? . . . that seems like a flaw.
** Or using one UserName and then another.

There are some possible ameliorations:
* Any deletion shows the ip/username of both deleters.
* Require two explanations per delete - since the delete must be seconded.
* No two IP addresses may second each other more than once per day (for the first 3 bytes of the ip address, wildcard the fourth).
** Remember though that spammers often add many random pages to this wiki. So this idea would make it harder to remove those pages.

''Good luck with that.''
* I take it you made the comment because you couldn't think of any solutions on your own?
** No, that is not why I made the comment. Actually I and others have written up some good ideas, too, see WikiVandalismSolutions and WikiSpamSolutions. You might consider moving your ideas over there. But I have yet to see anything done to stop vandals or spammers on this wiki, other than occasionally blocking an IP address.
