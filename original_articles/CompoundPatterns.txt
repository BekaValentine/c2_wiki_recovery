CompoundPatterns (a.k.a CompositeDesignPatterns) are the next step-up from individual patterns. They typically show how to combine two or three patterns together to solve a combined problem. Think of a pattern in GoFform where  at least two of the participants are full-fledged patterns as opposed to just classes and objects.
