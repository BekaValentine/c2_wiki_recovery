A Tiny smalltalk written by TimBudd. 

Sources for version 4 are at: ftp://ftp.cs.orst.edu/pub/budd/little/distr.tar (600k).
* No longer, now at http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~budd/Books/little/info/little/
* the links on that page are wrong also, however, if you add a file name (ie: distr.tar) to the end of this URL you can get the files one at a time. I'm not that keen on reading diffs, but the above change to interp.c is on line 728
* The best info about Little Smalltalk appears to be here: http://smalltalk.org/versions/LittleSmalltalk.html
* Versions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are now hosted and supported at http://www.littlesmalltalk.org

I've worked a bit on 'a little SmallTalk' to modernize it and called it Parla. I've fixed several bugs and added a mark sweep garbage collector. The version should build clean on any Unix look like system, and is able to to detect mingw/wine for crosscompiliation during the ./configure step.

* My Italian's not so strong...I think "chi parla" often means "who's speaking?" when answering the phone, but I guess idiomatically can mean "small talk", given it was used for this project?

A construct which boggles gcc and must be corrected is in interp.c:
  730c729
  <                       bytePointer = bp[bytePointer];  /* corrected */
  ---
  >                       bytePointer = bp[bytePointer++]; /* original */
  
''In defense of GCC, the original code has UndefinedBehavior, so GCC's apparent refusal to compile it seems quite reasonable.''

Also, the ascii files have dos lineendings, so on unix versions you must
  tr -d '\r' < { imageSource, test.st, any others }
Thanks to Stefan Aust for identifying these gotchas.
