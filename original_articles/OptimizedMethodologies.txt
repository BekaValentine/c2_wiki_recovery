Optimized Methodologies fit the situation so well that you dare not change them for fear of being worse off.

Optimal policies are always a small part of the possible options. Mathematically, they are of measure zero and so unlikely to occur by chance. Like being on the tip of a mountain peak in earthquake country, change often leads to a big drop.

Optimality also requires one single, well defined objective, value, or measure of quality.

Contrast with AdaptableMethodologies and AdaptiveMethodologies.

Pejorative use of Optimized and its contrast with Adaptive is found in publications by JimHighsmith.
