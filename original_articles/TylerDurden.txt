 Tyler Durden is the main protagonist from the novel "Fight Club" written by Chuck Palahniuk. Similar novel was adapted in
 a movie with the same name starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.Theme is based on a person who is a regular guy with a 
 life not so normal as he turns against the materialistic culture of the society, in the process he develops a split 
 personality wherein a other part of himself takes over him. This alter ego of the main character is named as Tyler Durden 
 who builds a mass following for himself all over the world after he starts an underground fight clubs.

 These fight clubs have the members from all the strata of the society be it police, doctor, driver and so on. People bored
 and sickened with material culture and the daily humdrum of life seeking a new meaning, a solace in the form of a 
 fighting. After a good fight among the members outcome is , blood splattered on the floor, people gaping the wounds but 
 still happy as it resulted in energy released, a new meaning is developed around every nonsense.
 
In between Tyler announces his philosophy to the people :
    * "How much can you possibly know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?"
    * "It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."
    * "I say never be complete, I say stop being perfect, I say let's evolve, and let the chips fall where they may"
    * "The things you own, they end up owning you."
    * "You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the       
       contents of your wallet. You're not your fucking khakis. We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."
    * "You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates 
       you. This is not the worst thing that can happen. We don't need Him. Fuck damnation, man, fuck redemption! If we are
       God's unwanted children, so be it!"
    * "Man, I see in Fight Club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see 
      squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising 
      has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of 
      history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our 
      Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, 
      and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off."
    * " You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as 
      everything else."
    * "The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space! Without pain, without 
      sacrifice, we would have nothing."
    * "We are the all singing all dancing crap of the world"
    * "Stop trying to control everything and just let go."
