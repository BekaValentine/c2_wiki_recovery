 We got these practices, they do it all.
 Support many projects both big and small.
 We add hardly nothin to our kit of tools,
 Though our tools can do it, folks call us fools.

 There used to be a guy, used the name of Occam,
 Was into simple, said "Features, Foccam.
 Don't add new stuff until you need it,
 Gotta carry it around, write it up and feed it".

 The Occam dude he dead as nails,
 But his ideas live, we follow his trails.
 We see a new problem, we check our kit,
 Tool we got can do it, we go with it.

 Idea's to have a kit that's light,
 Stay with what could work till that ain't right.
 Then add new stuff when you got a real need,
 That's the best way to go full speed.
