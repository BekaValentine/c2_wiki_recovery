Epiphany (http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/) is a WebKit based WebBrowser that aims to be very simple and conforming to the wonderful interface guidelines of the GnomeDesktopEnvironment.

Its tabs are managed as a StackDataStructure instead of a QueueDataStructure; if you click the links B, C and D on the page A in order, you end up with A, D, C, B instead of A, B, C, D. I find that this helps me keep track of what I'm reading, especially on wikis.
