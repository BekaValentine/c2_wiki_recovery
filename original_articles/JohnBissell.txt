Hi.  I'm CFO for Enterprise Engines, Inc. which is a software startup company located in San Mateo, California.  Our product is based on the years of OO consulting work of David Taylor.

Anyway, I came to this site based on some info I got from one of our lead programmers, Robert Larson.  Just wanted to check it out.  Pretty cool.

Just for the record, my email is mailto:jbissell@engines.com.  Why you would ever want to email me is beyond me, but I thought I'd give it anyway.
