PragmaticSmalltalk is a dialect of SmalltalkLanguage closely tied to EtoileOs.  It interoperates very cleanly (and fast) with the EtoileOs frameworks (which are improved versions of the GnuStep frameworks) and with CeeSharp.

See http://etoileos.com/news/archive/2012/08/19/1308/ for some example code.
