''Embracing Confusion: What Leaders Do When They Don't Know What to Do'' at http://www.pdkmembers.org/CGI-BIN/LANSAWEB?WEBEVENT+L294315134431A52E822444K+PDK+ENG lists an abstract for an article to decision making under confusion, via a method called RIA (Reflective Inquiry And Action).
* It was said in a different article, the Jentz and Murphy RIA technique has these five steps
** 1 - Acknowledge the confusing situation (and the negatives associated with it)
** 2 - Asssert need for reasonable solution (do not fake confidence)
** 3 - Structured interaction with others to achieve a common problem solving process
** 4 - Active listening to input from others
** 5 - "thinking out loud" about the new information gathered from others
* the authors assert managers will be measured by their behavior towards confusion, more than their knowledge, in an age of uncertainty.
