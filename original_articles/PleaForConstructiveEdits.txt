I've noticed later a tendency for people to come along and simply rubbish things they find. The insanely great thing about a wiki is that when you find something that's not true you don't have to just add a comment saying it's nonsense, '''you can actually add signal and remove noise.'''

Of course, some people simply get off on rubbishing others and never have anything positive to contribute, but next time you find yourself saying that other material is wrong, consider adding a correct exposition.

* Don't be negative,
** be positive.
* Don't be destructive,
** be constructive.
* Don't belittle,
** educate.

If you're clever enough to see other people's folly, stupidity or ignorance, help them.
