It is frustrating to get involved with learning DesignPatterns.

Twenty years ago IT applications worked fine without the use of these things.

Now it is like "fashion of the week", and they are hard to comprehend without the relevant CulturalAssumptions.

For example, I was reading HollywoodPrinciple, it looked like some kind of pattern, track it down to DependencyInjection page, and it confirmed that this is a pattern. Then went to MF site as suggested. And then get hit by the word "Java" staring at me.

I get intimidated. I do not want to know JavaLanguage. So is the page relevant to me still? Don't know. 

I still have this book "Design patterns for VbClassic" or something similar. The software got obsoleted before I have gone thru much of the pages in that book. Very concerned that history repeats itself.

2000 years ago, building went up just fine without blueprints, standard-sized lumber, etc.  Fifty years ago, seatbelts were not even an option in vehicles.  We learn better ways of doing things, and DesignPatterns allow us to handle more complexity in software. --PeteHardie
