I'm serious. Once a constraint to RefactorFasterDeleteMore, now a guide to GoodTasteInDeletion.

The idea is that jokes help a lot with readability.  If we're refactoring a page we don't simply want maximum density of signal but a balance between signal and readability. ImproveSignalAndReadability. So the rule of thumb suggested here is: if you find a good joke, try to keep the essence of the joke in the refactored version.

''And the corollary is - if you want your content to stay as is, make a good joke about it.''

You cannot be serious?

''That's right.''

I'm not convinced. '''Good''' jokes are good content, and should be preserved. Done well, they can help people understand and remember the content. But I've observed many clever but off-topic comments that were somewhat humorous, but not a valuable contribution to the page. -- JeffGrigg

''I agree that it should probably have been almost never delete '''good''' humor. -- RichardDrake''

Something that I find really interesting is the effect that good humour can have on a subject or an explanation. For example, teachers (or at least good ones) will often put in a joke, or some other ridiculous comment into the explanation, at the time, the lesson will be broken up, and it may well take a while for 'order' to be restored. But as they always say afterwards: at least you'll remember it. -- MatthewTheobalds

''Great point Matthew. And there are many business meetings where the only way the social and decision making logjam is finally broken is through an inspired piece of humor. I have seriously argued - successfully argued even - to people that one thing that proves that Wiki is a really great idea for business is that you can tell such good jokes in it. -- RichardDrake''
