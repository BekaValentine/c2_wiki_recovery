'''Comments'''

I am shocked and delighted that this list of games exactly mirrors my own opinions on this subject. I have made a minor edit, and I apologize in advance to anyone offended by it. I removed Myth 3 from this list.

As some might know, Myth 1 & 2 were developed by Bungie and released to great critical acclaim. Myth 3 was a poor knock-off developed by a different team, and was released with a great splat. I could not in good conscience allow it to sully an otherwise fantastic list of Games. -- MrStrange

What is the name of the game teens get addicted to? ''Everquest?'' ''The Sims?''

[No it's more a shooting thing. It's programmed by a Canadian nerd]

Counterstrike?

[Yes Counterstrike. This is supposed to be a highly addictive game and many cases have been reported of teens dropping out of school because of this game. My friend had a pretty rough reaction with his son's compulsive habit: he tore the internet connection and that was the end of the Counterstrike compulsion for his son. Incidentally the son is not at all violent. Go figure why he was spending hours behind a fake rifle!]

ModelingHypothesis vs CatharsisHypothesis

Catharsis of anger and violence is deprecated in psychology. IOW, it's complete BS.

It is well-known and extremely well-documented that "releasing" one's violent tendencies only CAUSES more violence.

No GTA series? I spent hours playing the original. It's just tons of fun to have a quick blast causing maximum destruction
in a virtual city.

I have never been violent in my life. I have played counter-strike and all these other violent games. To say doing something
causes the same effect in everyone is pretty dumb.

"worth playing"? What makes computer games in general worth the time we put into them?

* Amusement -- Playing a well-crafted game can be compared to how we enjoy other forms of art. More often, though, it can be compared to television.
* Gameplay -- A combination of game logic, operations, and rules. The way a game flows and how players' decisions affect the interaction of the game to the players and the players to each other.
* Bonding -- Multi-player games can provide bonds, rivalries, and the other kinds of social structures you see in sports. Single-player games give nerds something to talk about.
* Hobby -- A way to focus your energy; like gardening, I suppose.
* Education -- I'd guess that there are more games that demand that you learn many intricate details about your fictional universe, than there are that teach you useful things about your real universe. How many kinds of PokeMon are there now?
* Hand-eye coordination -- This was the excuse du decade in the 1980's.

Perhaps we could mark open-source or free games with an asterisk.
