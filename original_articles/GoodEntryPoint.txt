WardsWiki consists of many thousands of pages, each almost equally important.  Even the FrontPage isn't ''that'' special.  As a result people stumble into this site at some random point, presumably something relevant to a Web search.  These visitors don't initially have the context provided by the page's neighbors.

Turning this on its head, it becomes a problem for those wishing to create a ValuablePage for a broad section of the reading population.

The often-quoted WardCunningham said on WikiIsNotaDictionary,

	 :	[...] Ask yourself: if the page you cite were to be created, would it serve Wiki well as a point of entry in this web of knowledge?

Perhaps it is easier to describe the nature of a GoodEntryPoint than it is to prescribe WhenToCreatePages?

	* a useful set of BackLink''''''s or FanOut of WikiWord''''''s is probably the best way to get a visitor started.
	* a one-liner probably isn't so useful.

''The aim was to describe the usefulness of making any and all of the pages here into GoodEntryPoint''''''s to the Wiki, rather than having a couple of specially designated StartingPoints ''[see also: WikiFrontDoor]'' and letting the rest be incomprehensible to the new visitor.''

''The important distinction, I think, is that each page should be a good entry point '''to that particular group of pages''', ''i.e.'' the content.  Whether the page is a good entry point to a wiki in general is another question, and this is discussed on various pages.''

Then again, maybe we're better off just using the Wiki instead of talking about it so much. -- MatthewAstley
