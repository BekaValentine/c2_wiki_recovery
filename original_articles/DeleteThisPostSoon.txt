A WikiTag

*like DeleteThisPageSoon, but for single posts on a WikiPage.
*like DeleteWhenCooked, but there the trigger for deletion depends on the reader, whereas the trigger lies on this tag (to not forget it).

Or should I simply use DeleteWhenCooked for this one too?

''Yes. DeleteThisPageSoon. :)''
