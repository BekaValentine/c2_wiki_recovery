The BashShell provides zillions of ways to customize your prompt.

ChrisGarrod uses this prompt -- the prompt is shown both before and after the code that creates it:

 # 00:55:43 garrod@humu 1.74 $ cd ~ && grep ' 'PS .profile
 # yyp!!grep PS ~/.profile
 # PS is the prompt string, and can be customized a zillion ways
  PS1="\n"	# PS1 is the most commonly seen prompt is PS1 see man bash
  PS1="$PS1#"	# Make accidentally pasted lines comments
  PS1="$PS1$tickenv"	# w/TicketNo
  PS1="$PS1 \t" # the current time
  PS1="$PS1 \u" # the username
  PS1="$PS1@"	# the at sign (we're building an email address here)
  PS1="$PS1\h"  # the host name
  PS1="$PS1 `/bin/basename $tty '' 2>/dev/null||/usr/bin/basename $tty ''`" 
  PS1="$PS1."	# separate tty from command number
  PS1="$PS1\#"  # command line number in history
  PS1="$PS1 \\$"	# This is a dollar sign for normal use or a # when superusered
  PS1="$PS1 cd" # make it paste cleaner
  PS1="$PS1 \w" # the working directory - bracketed by space for cut/paste
  PS1="$PS1 &&" # make it paste cleaner across multiple windows and hosts
  PS1="$PS1 "	# make it paste cleaner
  PS2="	"	# wait to close quotes or compound statement (paste it!)
  PS3="Pick a number:	"	# try: select name in *;do echo $name;done
  alias PS="grep PS ~/$DotFile"
  export PS1 PS2 PS3

 # 00:56:03 garrod@humu 1.75 $ cd ~ && 

My favorite features are that inadvertant pastings of screen scrapes make prompting lines comments. 
The string in PS2 is actually a tab, so the whole continued command can be pasted elsewhere for future use.  
And having the '''cd''' to the current working directory followed by '''&&''' (if it worked do the rest) and then the current command I have typed.
There's also a blank line separating the output of the previous command from the prompt

PS3 is something I rarely use, so it's comment has a paster for me to try

The final result of the above code looks like this for my PS1, the primary prompt string
 PS1=\n# \t \u@\h 1.\# \$ cd \w &&
Years later, my prompt has evolved.  Today it looks like this:
 # 20130415.232138 garrod@Minnie''''''The''''''Moocher ttys000.1 $ cd ~ && echo $PS1
 \n# \D{%Y%m%d.%H%M%S} \u@\h ttys000.\# \$ cd \w &&

 # 20130415.232155 garrod@Minnie''''''The''''''Moocher ttys000.2 $ cd ~ && 
I use multiple Terminal windows on my Mac, so it helps to know which one I'm looking at just by the prompt.  
The first floating point number is a DateStamp.TimeStamp

That's my prompt.  What's yours? -- ChrisGarrod
