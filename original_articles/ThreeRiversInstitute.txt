Three Rivers studies the impact of agile software development.
	* What new business models are enabled?
	* What organizational changes are required?
	* How do agile teams work together, and how can they work better?

Current status-- Still mostly a dream, but becoming more real. We have a cool logo based on the kanji for "three rivers". We will soon be incorporated as a NotForProfit.

For our outsourced development audience, we are embarking on a marketing campaign to convince the CEOs of the world to stop thinking about buying software as if they were buying widgets, but rather as building a partnership with a key supplier.

History-- Invented in the spring of 2000 by KentBeck to explore the now-obviously complex relationship between software development and business.
