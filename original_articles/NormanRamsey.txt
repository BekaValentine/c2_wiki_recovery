Norman Ramsey has been fascinated with programming languages and program design ever since his first teacher told him his variables should ''not'' be named A, B, C, etc. MeaningfulName''''''s got him hooked on thinking about programming, which he currently teaches. He uses Wiki heavily in course work. He is a huge fan of GraphViz.
