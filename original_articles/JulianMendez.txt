Hi. My name is Julian, and I am teaching assistant of Discrete Mathematics at the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina).

I have obtained a degree in Computer Science and now I am specializing in Description Logics (http://dl.kr.org).

One of the activities I like most is to solve programming problems. In fact, I was contestant in the ACM Programming Contest (http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/), and in the Challenge 24 contest (http://www.challenge24.org). Also, I am contestant in online competitions, such as, the UVA Contest (http://acm.uva.es/) and the TopCoder contest (http://www.topcoder.com/tc).

If you like any of the mentioned topics and would like to contact me, I will be pleased to receive your email. You can check my webpage ar http://www.julianmendez.com.ar or write to juli747 at yahoo.com.ar.
