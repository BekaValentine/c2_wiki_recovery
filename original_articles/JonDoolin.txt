Describe JonDoolin here.

Just passing through.  I am working on a new website: http://www.spoonfedrelativity.com, and searching for functionality to see if I can get phpwiki to render an equation from codecogs.  I saw that there didn't seem to be any information in that direction, so I edited MathematicalFormulaExpansion to tell what I already knew.
