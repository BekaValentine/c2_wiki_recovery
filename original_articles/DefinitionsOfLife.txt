We all have our own subjective model of life, in the effort to find (the) One intersubjective model for life, we stumble into contradictions or other subjective arguments. Perhaps there exists One definition for all, what we intersubjective, call life, and perhaps it is described on the top of the page DefinitionOfLife.

Because of the non-agreeable "feeling" on that page, i think it's best if we try this approach. And this is the place.

"I" want to have a couple of definitions that really work well for each example of life. And then know the limitations of each model, and then try to find the common DistinctionOfLife, if any. Please feel free to make your own definition below, and let's see what happens! good luck to us all! :D
