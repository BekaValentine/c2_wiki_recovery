I just took a job at Mercury Interactive as a Systems Engineer. Mercury was purchased by HPSoftware which is where I am now. 

Prior to that I was at WebMethods, AvantGo and GemStone.

My technology focus is object oriented and distributed computing. If I had my choice I'd rather play Hockey, but you got to make a buck some how...
