* We're a weird species ... -- RonJeffries

Henri Poincar√© once said:
* Doubt everything or believe everything: these are two equally convenient strategies. With either we dispense with the need for reflection. 
* Science is no more a collection of facts than a house is a collection of bricks.
* If God speaks to man, he undoubtedly uses the language of mathematics. Language is one of our most powerful assets both in and out of the classroom.
* If nature were not beautiful, it would not be worth knowing, and if nature was not worth knowing, life would not be worth living.
* Just as houses are made out of stones, so is science made out of facts; and just as a pile of stones is not a house, a collection of facts is not necessarily science.
* Mathematics is a language in which one cannot express imprecise or nebulous thoughts.
* Sociologists discuss sociological methods; physicists discuss physics.
* The pursuit of an idea is as exciting as the pursuit of a whale.
* Facts do not speak. [Nevertheless, let me attempt to interpret the results presented here.]
* Great mathematicians are not made, they're born.
* He would let tough problems incubate in his mind for periods of time and solutions would just pop into his head at odd moments, such as when stepping off a curb.
* It is by logic that we prove. It is by intuition that we discover.
* Mathematicians do not destroy the obstacles with which their science is spiked, but simply push them toward its boundary.
* Mathematics is the art of saying the same thing in as many different ways as possible.
* Sociologists spend practically all of their time on their methods without ever applying them to anything.
* The key to investigating any new mathematical object is to look at its set of automorphisms.
