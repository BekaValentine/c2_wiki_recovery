''Recently (Oct 23, 1941), a lot of pages/comments have been appearing that say things such as''
* Recently blah has been in the news
* Blah has changed recently
* Recently, the court case has taken an interesting turn.
* Recently, 486DX machines have taken home computing to great new speeds.

The very next time that somebody edits that page, the term "recently" no longer has any context. Use a date, use a month, use SOME frame of reference.

The word recently should be restricted to conversations, and never used in a document (ie. a wiki page).
* ReplaceRelativeDateWithAbsolute
* ReplaceDateWithWikiNow
