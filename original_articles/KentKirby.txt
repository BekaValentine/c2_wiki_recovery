''Kent, AreYouThere? [October 26, 2003 - last edited January 19, 2001]''

My name is Kent Kirby.  I work for AT&T Laboratories in
Kansas City.  I have worked in Object Oriented technologies
for 5 years.  I have performed the duties of SystemArchitect for the past two years within the Network Services
Division of AT&T. 

I have designed and implemented three Object Oriented
systems.  As I have matured in my design skills I have 
become more interested in "DesignPatterns".  I attended
a patterns workshop at OOPSLA '95 led by the gang-of-four.
Having read the gamma, etc. book I have begun to use some
of the patterns described within there.
