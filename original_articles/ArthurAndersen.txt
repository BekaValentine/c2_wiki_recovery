Okay, so why hasn't anyone figured out yet that we need to take AA's entire client list, start from the top, work our way down, picking them off one by one with the BeeBeeGunOfJustice?!?

There's an old saying ''If you owe the bank 1000 pounds that's a problem for you, if you owe the bank 100,000,000 that's the bank's problem.''

Seems to me if AA's entire client list had bent accounts the economy of the US and several other countries is is trouble. 

''And of course, the entire client list does not have bent accounts.''

The bent ration of AA clients is at the moment surly a matter a speculation? 

I think if 100% of the thousands of companies audited by AA were bent, that would become obvious rather quickly. The idea that they all are is laughable.

Yes, to say all or 100% is slack, however it is naive to presume that there are no more bent ones; other auditors may also have been as accommodating as AA. A number of very large companies were bent and managed to hide the fact for a period of time, what we cannot know is how many more of them there are.
