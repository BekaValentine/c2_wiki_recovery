Pull (Clone) to Local, Push (Modifications, Comments, Edits , Responses, Attachments) to a personally controlled WebSite, with reference to the P''''''ulledPage.
This would be a wiki of type ArtifactWiki.

While thinking about how one might clone a wiki to a local machine for O''''''ffLineUse, I thought about how one could respond to or make changes viewable by others to a R''''''eadOnlyWiki.

I think this would be possible if a L''''''ocalWikiInformationProcessor exists and is programmed to "Pull" (download) a page, or series of pages from the R''''''eadOnlyWiki (Clone) and then post to a personally controlled F''''''tpServer, S''''''pecialResponseFormatFlatTextFiles. A N''''''otificationSite on the R''''''eadOnlyWiki could be provided to indicate that you have made a response with the time, your name, what type of response (determines how to process the flat text response), R''''''esponseInternetLocale and F''''''ileName of the response:
*D''''''ateTimeStamp.P''''''ageName.R''''''espondentName.R''''''esponseType.R''''''espondentInternetLocale.R''''''esponseName.

This requires that the user have a space where a file can be uploaded (which would authenticate the user, by password or other means) and in which the file would be I''''''nternetReachable. This might be a person's own site, or a space provided by a commune. This PullPushWiki, would be in a sense a R''''''eadOnlyWiki with appended commentary or processing.

This concept might be integrated into a Federated Wiki Collection Environment using ParallelProcessing Concepts and Peer-to-peer File Processing
