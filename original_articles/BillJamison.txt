Of late I work in Java, though I have had painful experiences in many other languages (and other types of languages) as well.  

I am excited to at the opportunity to learn from Ron, Ward, Kent, and the many others here who are teaching me that many of the things I spent much time and money to learn are either ridiculous oversimplifications or flat wrong.

I am looking forward to OOPSLA2000 - I expect to be living and working in the area when it comes through. I am looking forward to the opportunity to meet again many of the folks whose conversation I have enjoyed here on WikiWikiWeb.

I am surprised at how much foolishness I sometimes put up with - fortunately I seem to have reached my limit. Ward told some of us three years ago that we were making a mistake - was he ever right? i dont know, but i am clever.
