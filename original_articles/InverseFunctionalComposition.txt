Some people define InverseFunctionalComposition to avoid these read-last-to-first definitions, e.g.

 f >>> g = \x -> g (f x) -- in Haskell's Control.Category

Thank you. I had not thought of that and I cannot find it in RealWorldHaskell. I have implemented it in FunctoidsInCpp which has not been much work at all given that '''compose''' already existed there. I have had a look around to find some academic discussion of this and so far drawn a blank.  Can anyone help? Thanks -- JohnFletcher
