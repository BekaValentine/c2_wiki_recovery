An informal group of developers in LondonTown who meet every month or so to discuss software architecture.  We met and discuss ComponentBasedDevelopment, LayeredFrameworks, ThirdPartyBinding, and AbstractInteractions.

Contact CharlesWeir for more information.

Let's try to meet on July 28th. I'll sort out a venue. Confirmed so far:
DavidHarvey, TimMackinnon, BenedictHeal, JohnDaniels (probably), AndyMoorley,  RichardDrake, CharlesWeir (maybe) and RogerMarlow, NatPryce (probably).

Any suggestions for a topic?

--SteveFreeman

	* Experiences with XP (what experiences can we report)
	* Aspect Oriented Programming - can it improve your architecture<g>
	* Project Estimation - can your architecture improve your estimate<g>

''These don't look like architecture topics -- JohnDaniels''

OK, then make a counter-offer... --Anonymous

Does adding the latter bits make them architectural? --TimMackinnon

	* Architectures for small embedded systems...what's different? --CharlesWeir

A joint meeting with the inaugural get together of the LondonExtremeGroup (LEG), formerly the LondonXpCommunity is proposed. The Xpers (there may even be some closet Xpers in LAG) are very interested in architecture but only in short bursts.  They'll leave quietly and discuss the future of LEG at another table if anyone asks.  Would help to know which pub to start in though.

The LAG have traditionally met in the boardroom of "The City Pipe", a wine bar close to St. Paul's tube station.  CharlesWeir will have details...

From St Pauls Tube, head North up St. Martins on the Cheapside corner. Almost immediately you reach a wine bar called the City Vaults. Go inside and somewhere in there is a linking corridor to the City Pipe. 6:45 in "The Boardroom".

When is the next meeting of either of these two groups?

''A: August 25th at the City Pipe, 6:45pm'' (see also: http://demo.niki.co.uk:9001/servlets/niki?get=LondonExtremeGroup BrokenLink)

London Architecture Group seems to have disappeared in the early 2000s.

From 1999 to 2009 (ongoing) much of its role is played by the ExtremeTuesdayClub (XtC).  As of 2009, meeting every Tuesday at 6 pm at various pubs in central London, often in the City.  http://xpday-london.editme.com/eXtremeTuesdayClub (archive of the first ten years at http://www.xpdeveloper.net/xpdwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=XtC )
