Looking for AntiPattern''''''s in SoftwareDevelopment ProjectManagement

I am:
	* Brazilian
	* Ph.D. in Computing and Systems Engineering
	* Electronic Engineer
	* professor in Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro 
	* consultant
	* quite amazed by this Wiki thing

I am interested in:
	* Software Engineering (long term)
	* Databases (long term)
	* Fuzzy Logic (medium term)
	* Project Management (medium term)
	* Mobile Computing (recent)
	* Patterns (recent)

Languages I used and grokked (did some useful programs or large systems): 
	* Portuguese (I grok in portuguese)
	* English (I can grok in English if I want)
	* TI-86 programming language, small memory, big engineering problems
	* HP-28C language
	* BasicLanguage - GwBasic, Trs80Basic, AppleBasic, SinclairBasic
	* AlgolLanguage - Burroughs - my first ''real'' programming language
	* PascalLanguage - TurboPascal, Delphi, kind of small Algol
	* LispLanguage - muLisp, probably no fully grokked now that we have ClosLanguage
	* CeeLanguage - TurboC (since 1.0), BorlandC, CeeBuilder, GnuC, 
	* CeePlusPlus - CeeBuilder, GnuC, know nothing about STL though
	* ActorLanguage - can you remember this object oriented pascal that imitated Smalltalk?
	* AwkLanguage - did some complex text filtering stuff once
	* PerlLanguage - for web development
	* JavaLanguage - just discovering java.security now
	* StructuredQueryLanguage - tool of the trade
	* JavaScript - learn while you play
	* PostScript - had to do some tricks and plan a course onde - almost a ForthLanguage
	* HTML - how to Wikify?
	* XML - see HTML 
	* RichTextFormat - had to make a 4000 pages document once which could have some small errors after generated to be corrected. Printer was not PS compatible, and anyway it would be difficult to modify by a human being, so I learned RTF and generated a document in it in 18 hours.
	* Italian - language for eating - yes, eating in Italian makes the food better
	* 8080, Z80 assembler - Z80 assembler was as simple as it could be, but no simpler
	* CaslLanguage - nice small PalmOs development environment.

Languages I grokked (learned and toyed around):
	* HP41CV programming language
	* ForthLanguage
	* SmalltalkLanguage
	* SnobolLanguage
	* PrologLanguage
	* SchemeLanguage
	* French
	* PostScriptLanguage
	* AplLanguage (and forgot completely)
	* ObjectiveCee
	* x86 Assembler
Languages I tried to grok and puked
	* MumpsLanguage
	* VisualBasic (but used!)
	* PDF (not for humans...)
	
Languages I should have grokked
	* German
	* 68000 assembler
	
Languages I am trying to grok
	* JayLanguage
	
My GreatBooksListGeraldoX''''''exeo (see below)

	* YetAnotherProgrammer 
	* YetAnotherMeetingWillSolveIt 
	* GiveMeEstimatesNow 
	* TheyUnderstoodMe
	* StandardWay
	* HolyGraal
	* TheMindsIbook
	* StanislawLem

Geraldo:
There is a project in here somewhere, and it's a 'for-profit' one! In a world of 'convergence'...you've converged. I am hoping we might tag along. Let us know.

Best regards,

Geraldo, don't take it personally if someone modifies your content or removes your signature from something you wrote. Wiki has a different idea of authorship compared to other forums. If someone revises something you wrote, they might remove your signature so others know that it isn't the work of just one person. -- RobHarwood

''Hi Rob! I am actually happy if someone interacts. However, should I sign what I write or not? It seems to me that signing was a GoodThing.''

They can be a GoodThing or a BadThing, depending on your perspective. See UsingSignatures for some discussion of it. Sometimes I sign, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I read something I wrote a while ago and remove the signature. I ''do'' believe that DocumentMode is better than ThreadMode, and I also believe that DocumentMode should (usually) present an anonymous document section at the top of the page, but that's just my opinion. It's up to you if you want to sign your contributions, I just wanted to make sure you didn't get offended when I noticed you restored one of your signatures that had been removed.

Fun... I was just signing things I had written before and thought that should be signed. Not even noticed that you had deleted the signature... ;-)

'''Geraldo Xexeo's list of great books:'''

* LordOfTheRings do I need to explain? I am one of the spellbound people around the world, but not a fanatic (I don't speak elven languages and usually forgot parts of the plot). Read twice in portuguese and three times in english.

* TheHobbit smaller and easier. More RPG-like also. I already lost three for friends.

* GoedelEscherBach, really enjoyed the holistic versus minimalistic discussion and ArtificialIntelligence stuff. Learned about Escher, which I now have 5 books about and really like. Have you ever seen an original Escher '''stamp''' (I miss the word for it)? The are amazing.

* HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy and other books by DouglasAdams, but the funniest one is LastChanceToSee, describing a travel to see to eight to be extinct species. I actually fell from the bed laughing. ''well... I used to sleep in a matress in the floor, so it was not something I was afraid of''.

* Foundation, the trilogy, by IsaacAsimov. Quintessential SciFi.

* TheArtOfComputerProgramming... Just learn how to sort things ;-)

* TheMythicalManMonth converted me to software engineering when I was at University.

* NiklausWirth programming books, like AlgorithmsPlusDataStructuresEqualsPrograms, later renamed to AlgorithmsAndDataStructures.

* StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms told me that we are wizards.

* PoesiaCompleta, FernandoPessoa, well, you must know portuguese to enjoy the greatest modern portuguese poet. 

* EdgarAllanPoe, complete works. 

* PeopleWare, or how telephones are annoying things.

* The GangOfFour book, DesignPatternsBook. You must use a pattern to grok it fully, so I keep it just besides me until I really use all.

* StructuredProgramming by EwDijkstra. You must read it and think when it was written. 

* AlicesAdventuresInWonderland  and ThroughTheLookingGlass. Was LewisCarroll on drugs?

* TheAcmTuringAwardLectures,  20 incredible good talks.
