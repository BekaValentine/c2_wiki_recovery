I am a longtime SAS programmer, Snowboarder, birdwatcher, poet, cyclist and East Enders (http://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/) aficionado. Also Father (in separate sentence to stress lack of ordering in the above list).

I live in Basel Switzerland, a great town on a great river. For more about me, see http://www.centrepoint.ch/ThinRaft/ and http://www.bsiag.com/.

Oh Yes. Today is my 50th birthday (28th August actually - it's after midnight and I'm on my cube again trying to understand WikiWiki :-), an attribute I share with JohannWolfgangVonGoethe.

Happy 51st Birthday!
