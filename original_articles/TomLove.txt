Tom founded ProductivityProductsInternational, later to become StepStone, where he and BradCox developed and took ObjectiveCee to market.

Tom is a long time admirer of the Macintosh. (He designed parts of his Connecticut home on one.) Tom must have been proud to see SteveJobs adopt Objective-C, though it doesn't seem to have made him rich.
