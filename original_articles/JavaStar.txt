'''Discontinued'''

''On November 2, 1999, Sun[tm] made a strategic decision to discontinue further development efforts on its suite of Testing Tool products, which includes the JavaLoad[tm], JavaStar[tm], JavaScope[tm] and JavaSpec[tm] products. No new development has been done on these products in the way of feature additions or compatibility updates for new releases of the supported platforms (OS or JDK).''

JavaStar is a GUI testing tool written in Java for Java applications / applets from SunMicrosystems.

	* Does anyone have experience with that tool ? 
	* Any advice on using it / not using it ? 
	* Comparison to JavaUnit ?

Thanks.--PeterGassmann

Does JavaUnit handle GUI testing? If so, how? 

''JavaUnit does not handle GUI testing like JavaStar. I was more asking for a comparison of the usefulness of using JavaUnit vs. JavaStar in a project. Would it be better to concentrate on GUI testing (with something like JavaStar) or to concentrate on unit testing with JavaUnit ? What is more helpful ? Which approach do developers like better ? In which phase of an OO project should one concentrate on GUI testing ?'' -- PeterGassmann

We plan to use JavaStar for functional testing, rather than unit testing. It is pretty expensive, BTW. -- GaryCapell
