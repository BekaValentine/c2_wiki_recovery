Describe DatIvjaj here.

It's the prefix Da-    indicating second person singular subject with a third person object
     the verb tIv      enjoy
 and the suffix -jaj   indicating a desire or wish that the action of the verb occur.

DatIvjaj - may you enjoy (whatever preceded the verb).
That's right, preceded, the object goes before the verb in Klingon.
