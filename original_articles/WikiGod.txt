Usually the web administrator of the Wiki or its programmer, the WikiGod is the person who has all rights, powers and respects over a Wiki and its members. Not often present due to lack of time, the WikiGod prefers to focus on its main job like preparing new versions of its Wiki by adding new functionalities and presentations or repairing security holes.
