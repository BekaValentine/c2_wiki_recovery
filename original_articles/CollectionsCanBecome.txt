''Initially Collections are only the result of an AccumulationProcess - ButUnless - They may lead to becoming an SingleArtifact - '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20141031 0800

Some people are collection animals - gathering a bunch of stuff and putting in a container or two or many, for FuturePurposes

While Collections may appear to be only a StackOfStuff, each collection is in a sense the stuff for making of single things. 
* WeNeedExamples
** A '''book''' is a collection (a stack) of pages
** A '''painting''' is an assembly of colored pigments
** A '''drawing''' is a positioning of symbolic elements
** and some more of TheOtherThings

Some things which are a StackOfStuff lend themselves to assembly or forming processes into artifacts because they are already organized when piled up.

Other stacks are ConfusedTangledAndUseless, ButUnless, they may become orderly by a process of organization and filtering, where stuff is taken from the pile and sorted into two piles:
* One - OrganizedOnPurpose
* Two - Things remaining ConfusedTangledAndUseless
