I'm a software engineer, and I specialize in web applications.

I helped write XmlTestSuite, an open source application for testing web applications (e.g. asp, cold fusion, jsp etc).

I've browsed these pages often over the past few years, and find them very enlightening.

I'm based in London and can be contacted by mailto:davd@netriser.net.

''Welcome.''
