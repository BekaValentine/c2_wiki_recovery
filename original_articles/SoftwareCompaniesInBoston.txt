Let's all try to chip in some info to help our fellow programmers who are out of work in different cities of the US and the world.

Let's write down names of companies working in software in and around Boston. There ought to be a better way than this; sadly, while there are jobs sites and recruiters there is no listing of software engineering companies. A raw listing is nice because not all employers advertise on jobs sites or with recruiters, and not all positions are advertised. So it can pay to cold-send a resum√© to potential employers, especially if you already have contact with someone on the inside.
