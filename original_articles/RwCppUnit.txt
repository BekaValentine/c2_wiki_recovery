I liked the CppUnit idea, but was unable to use the code because the project that I am working on does not use the StandardTemplateLibrary, but rather RogueWave. I have created a version of CppUnit that works for me (I gave a copy to RonJeffries, but haven't seen it on his web site).  The differences between the two libraries would make creating a common source difficult, so I sort of expect to end up having to maintain my own version. I'll try to keep up with the latest ideas, but keep me in mind if you're making changes as I might miss something. Thanks.

12/16/1999:
The SystemWeenies here have altered the configuration of the machine I was
using and so I had to figure out, under the new configuration how to build
the software, including RwCppUnit. Turned out that something has changed
which is causing name space pollution between the current version of RwCppUnit
and the RogueWave software - redefining "assert" is now causing compile
errors in RogueWave. I hate changing horses in the middle of a race, but
rather than risk my sanity trying to get everything to live together, I'm
going to bite the bullet and use a different macro in my test objects.

I think I'll call it "pass if". Seems to me to be the shortest, most direct
phrase that covers what's happening. I can also create a "fail if" macro
for the inverse case as the C/C++ not operator (!) is not exactly the
height of readability.

Don - how are you progressing with this? I see no mention of RwCppUnit on the xprogramming website, and unfortunately I can't find your email address here to drop you a mail. I have similar problems and don't particularly want to reinvent the wheel!

Hello,
I am having the same sort of namespace conflicts (even though we are using
STL - I'm getting "blah already defined" linker errors). I'd be very interested 
in taking a look at RwCppUnit. Drop me a line, if you read this (Donald, Steve, or whoever has access to the code). Thanks!

Follow-up:
It seems that with our app, we were having a conflict because we were
using MFC statically linked, but cppUnit uses it dynamically linked.
We changed our project settings (for the debug version) to use MFC
dynamically linked as well.

'assert' is reserved for c/c++ compiler implementors. DontUseReservedNames.

I'm also working on a project with non-STL RogueWave tools and would appreciate being able to try RwCppUnit. Thanks.
