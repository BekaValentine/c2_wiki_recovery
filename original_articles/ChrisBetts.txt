A recent visitor to wiki - aside from being unable to resist joining in a debate on compulsory voting and Australia (in YouCantForceVoting) I haven't had much to say, except that wiki seems like an excellent pasture to browse in.

When not being sidetracked by things wiki, I run a small open source project (a java ldap browser at http://jxplorer.org ), work in web services security/UDDI and stuff with Computer Associates in Melbourne, Australia, maintain a personal web site at http://pegacat.com describing my PhD work in nanotechnology, and live in a forest on the top of mount Dandenong overlooking Melbourne and the bay.
