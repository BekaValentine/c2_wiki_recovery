AnswerMe.
I was going through JXTA classes and found that the JXTA exceptions are organised into a separate package. What is the benefit of such an organisation? Personally, I feel that exceptions should be organised into the packages where they are being used and logically belong. I tend to view packages as different layers and am not comfortable with all the exceptions corresponding to different layers to be clubbed together. Perhaps there is some benefit that I am overseeing. -- VhIndukumar

''It depends on your choice. If you want to keep with each layer you can do so, else there could be a single place to keep and log the exception on top level.''
