The CeeLanguage has been around a long time and has been hugely successful. As a result, many subsequent ProgrammingLanguage''''''s have tried to ride on C's coattails by adopting its basic syntax, hoping to ease adoption by the legions of existing C programmers. There has been debate about whether ItsTimeToDumpCeeSyntax or ItsNotTimeToDumpCeeSyntax.

Supersets of C:
* CeePlusPlus
* ObjectiveCee

Almost the entire syntax:
* CeeShell
* CsharpLanguage
* EeLanguage
* DeeLanguage
* JavaLanguage
* JavaScript
* PhpLanguage

Expression syntax (such as '&' for LogicalAnd, '^' for XOR, ''<<'' for shift, etc.)
* PerlLanguage
* PythonLanguage
* many others
