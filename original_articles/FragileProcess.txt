Hey guys, this is a piece of news I just heard:

In response to the AgileAlliance, FragileProcess inventors have formed the FragileAlliance.

The members of the FragileAlliance are avoiding considering new ways of developing software, yet re-inventing new ones all the time.

The FragileAlliance values:

* Worrying over ProblemSolving.
* Focusing blame on people rather than the problem.
* Delay over action.
* Revising a plan instead of following it.
* More documentation on top of more documentation.
* The avoidance of any firm commitments to management or customers regarding schedule or budget. The motto of the FragileProcess: ''Were always NinetyPercentDone!''

That is, while there is little value in what a FragileProcess does, practitioners take great pride in doing it.

Apparently, there was already a group defining FragileDevelopment. In the spirit of FragileDevelopment, I'll leave this duplication as it is for the moment.
