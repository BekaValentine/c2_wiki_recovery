Not all who contribute content to Wiki are operating in ''author'' mode. The primary goals of a WikiAuthor are to support, improve, create, and encourage DocumentMode and SignedDocumentMode content. The WikiAuthor achieves these goals by working collaboratively or alone to form pages that elucidate, define, present, or teach. 

''A WikiAuthor...''

	* A WikiAuthor avoids the use of first and second person references because s/he knows these encourage ''discordant-contrarianism''.
	* ''Instead'', the WikiAuthor attempts to author without personalities to encourage ''collective-prose''.

	* A WikiAuthor does not contribute ''responses'' to arguments in ThreadMode pages.
	* ''Instead'', the WikiAuthor attempts to author ''statements'' or ''conclusions'' that retain meaning outside of their ''conversational context''.

	* A WikiAuthor does not sign ThreadMode contributions unless they are a transient way to clarify miscommunication.
	* ''Instead'', a WikiAuthor adds their signature to the list of contributors to a completed DocumentMode page and refactors miscommunications once they have been resolved.

	* A WikiAuthor does not post questions for others to answer, as this encourages conversation instead of prose. 
	* ''Instead'', the WikiAuthor uses PromptingStatement''''''s

	* A WikiAuthor does not argue a point in ThreadMode.
	* ''Instead'', the WikiAuthor will try to author a new DocumentMode page that presents the dissenting point of view. The WikiAuthor does this because s/he prefers to see two well presented ''cases'' rather than an interwoven debate.

''WikiAuthor tips...''

	* ''To keep a DocumentMode page pristine'', a WikiAuthor uses MoveThreadModeToDiscussionPage. For example, discussion about NullObject is moved to NullObjectDiscussion. 

	* ''A WikiAuthor kills a ThreadMode page slowly'' by using TentativeSummary and ThereforeBut so that a DocumentMode page may emerge in its stead.

	* ''As an alternative to ThreadMode'' a WikiAuthor considers DialecticMode..

A WikiAuthor is energized by diversity. Because of this, the WikiAuthor does ''not'' like to see points flying back and forth hidden within a single page where a user's power of persuasion is more compelling than the actual perspective being presented. ''Instead'', a WikiAuthor prefers it when each page perfects a single point of view. ''Instead'' of ''arguing against'' something, the WikiAuthor endeavors to ''argue for'' something else. For example, instead of railing against BigDesignUpFront on the BigDesignUpFront page, we create another page named TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign that argues for this point of view instead of against the BigDesignUpFront point of view. This way, readers evaluate ideas rather than arguments. This is the WikiAuthor way.

''A Wiki user need not always operate in the mode of a WikiAuthor.'' This is a preference, an ethic. It is not a list of unbreakable rules. A WikiAuthor says only that these are his or her preference without saying it should be everyones.
