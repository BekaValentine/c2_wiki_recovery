FreeHand is a PostScript illustration program very similar (and some people think much better) than Adobe Illustrator.  It was written by a small company in Richardson, Texas called Altsys, and it was initially licensed and sold by Aldus.  Altsys regained the full rights to FreeHand after Adobe bought Aldus.  Shortly thereafter Macromedia bought Altsys, so these days FreeHand is known as Macromedia FreeHand.

Note that "FreeHand" has a capital "H" everywhere, not just on Wiki.
