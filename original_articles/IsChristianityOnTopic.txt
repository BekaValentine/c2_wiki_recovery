Suggestion: if you don't like the Christianity pages (as I don't), then don't read them and for G*d's sake (if there is one) don't respond to them. I'm going back to that strategy, just wanted to share it with those who haven't thought of it. -- RonJeffries

''The above should not be read as saying that I don't like Christianity. I do. I don't like those '''''pages'''''.'' -- rj

WhyClublet is a wiki that is much more suited to such discussions. .... '''I didn't find this page on Why? Why?''' ''Because it is obvious that on Why, Christianity (as well as other world views) is (are) on topic.''

WhyClublet has expired, so Christianity must be fundamentally wrong.

As an exercise in reasoning and establishing empirical evidence rules and guidelines (a HolyWar in itself), it can be relevant. However, the ArgumentFromAuthority aspect of it is generally off-topic.
