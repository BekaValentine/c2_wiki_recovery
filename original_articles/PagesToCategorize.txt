A few wikizens have the opinion that every page on this wiki should have a category (see WikiCategories for an explanation of the system). A few feel worthwhile pages should be categorized. Some are opposed to categorizing all of the pages as found on the page: PleasePleaseDontCategorizeEveryPageOnWiki. An agreeable approach is that where it is helpful, Categories assigned to pages can aid the average WikiReader in navigating this wiki.

* Project started on: Circa 18 Nov. 2004
* PagesWithoutCategory: 15793
* Project continues -- completion date fixed at 30 June 2007 (Steady as she goes) A project like this takes time. Presently I have a little time dedicate each day to this project. It will required the steady categorization of just under 25 pages each day. (A task which is on target) Check here for reports of progress.

* Slightly more than one-half of the pages have categories assigned.   

Helpful in this project are comprehensive listings of the pages without assigned categories. Those who would be aided in this project by a provision of daily updated lists can check 
the sites currently providing lists of pages without categories and consider members of the lists as candidates for categorization.
