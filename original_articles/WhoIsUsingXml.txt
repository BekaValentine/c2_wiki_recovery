People using XML:

* Microsoft in IE5 and Office 2000.
* Netscape to specify the UI in Mozilla.
* Securities and Exchange Commission EDGAR database (forthcoming).
* DoIt is using XML to provide a simpler interface to a proprietary mainframe message format.
* OMG will use XML as interchange format between tools. XML beat CDIF for this.
* Chase Manhattan Bank uses XML to define data formats used in messages sent with MQSeries. (See http://www.trireme.com/ot99/programme/Sullivan.htm for the session on this at OtNinetyNine.)
* PageFlex (http://www.pageflexinc.com ), a subsidiary of Bitstream, has a product that creates customized and professionally-typeset brochures, data sheets, etc., based on XML-formatted data.
* Adobe's proposed strategy: NetworkPublishing
* http://home.iclweb.com/icl2/mhkay/gedml.html for a good example XML application -- Genealogical Data.
* A cool site that's driven by XML, with links therein that show how it works, is http://www.classx.com
* ApacheAnt
* Real Networks and others, to describe a time-based presentation composed of multiple elements - such as adding subtitles to a video.  The specific XML type is SMIL, Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language, http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-smil/
* SunMicrosystems in it's StarOffice / OpenOffice product as it's native document file format ( http://www.openoffice.org ).
* Oracle 8i (relational database) has extensive XML support.
* http://www.multimania.fr. Most of the 'editorial' content there (articles and the like) is stored as XML. I view it as one great 'success story' for XML (and not just because I wrote their content management system). The main point is that XML allows you, by the judicious use of companion standard XSLT, to separate form and content. Authors don't use HTML; they write articles and other documents as structured, marked-up text. All display attributes such as bold, italics, fonts, image positioning, 'horizontal rule' type separators between sections, whatever... are specified in XSLT stylesheets that are under the sole authority of the graphic designers. Thus, changing content does not involve graphic designers or HTML integrators; conversely, changing style characteristics doesn't involve content authors. This separation allows for a much better publishing process. Also, the process doesn't actually involve DTDs - in practice they turned out not to be necessary.
* The ResourceDescriptionFramework is a widely-used way to list syndicated headlines. It's implemented at many weblogs, and if you have a SlashDot account which pulls stories from MemePool, MissingMatter, and ArsTechnica, it's using RDF.
* AtgDynamo has an XML repository for content management and numerous XSL type enhancements.
* The CubicCompass portal server makes extensive use of XML (http://www.cubiccompass.com) 
* New JavaBeans persistence (JDK 1.4)
* SimpleObjectAccessProtocol
* XmlRpc
* AndyGlew in his computer architecture work, to record experimental data, drive test suites, etc.
* http://www.whois.sc provides a free xml api to search domains.

Ha! WhoIsUsingXml! That may be the funniest thing I've ever read here. Who ''isn't'' using XML? -- RobertFisher (^_^)
  Don't forget the Wiki is older than XML. -- boa
...but not SGML, which is the heritage of XML.

I can't imagine trying to do a web application these days without XML to transport my data about.

''Yep; this is a pretty dated page.  ;->  I can recall, when XML was "the amazing new thing!" I kept saying that soon saying "I'll send the data to you in XML format" will be accepted as being just about as normal and meaningless as saying "I'll send the data to you on a nine track tape."  Yep; it's happened.  (...except that nine track tapes are really, really dead now.  ;-)''
