I play several roles, most importantly the roles of father and husband.  My career started as an officer in the US Air Force implementing cockpit simulation systems for research, then moved into the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing domains.  Now I've made a complete switch and am CTO for Corillian (http://www.corillian.com), an eFinance software solutions provider.  I'm very active in the Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I, http://www.ws-i.org) helping to construct some of the sample applications that demonstrate interoperability among the major platform vendors.

I keep a blog here: http://www.chrisbrooks.org.

I love to play games of all sorts, especially German-style boardgames.  If you are ever in the Portland, OR area and want to meet up, shoot me an email. You can learn more here:

Some books I've read lately:
	* ''HMS Surprise'', Patrick O'Brian.  This series is an amazing collection of historical fiction. ISBN 0393307611
	* ''Crossroads of Twilight'', Robert Jordan.  I keep sticking with this series (I've come this far...) but it sure drags. ISBN 0312864590
	* ''Test Driven Development'', Kent Beck.  Quick read, some redundant content, but overall very helpful. ISBN 0321146530
