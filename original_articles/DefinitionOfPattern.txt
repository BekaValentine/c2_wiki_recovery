'''Discussion:'''

''From CommunityLifeCycle where the (mis)use of the word "pattern" caused some potential confusion. Or maybe this is about what constitutes appropriate content for Wiki. Suddenly I'm not sure -- PhilGoodwin''

[This] is not a "pattern", at least in the sense of ChristopherAlexander's work, the DesignPatterns book, and the PortlandPatternRepository. The life-cycle above is an interesting and possibly useful description of several communities. It is not "a solution to a problem in a context". It does not seem to fit any other definition of "pattern" commonly used in this community. Not all good ideas are patterns. -- CliffordAdams

At least one person objects to my objection above. Perhaps the old definitions of "pattern" are too confining. Perhaps the C2 wiki should become a "good idea" rather than just a "pattern" repository. In any case, I think it is proper to point out that "pattern" has a specific meaning to many people here. -- CliffordAdams (who encourages more discussion on this topic, and would love to learn something)

I'd call CommunityLifeCycle a descriptive pattern as opposed to a prescriptive pattern, in that it abstracts a description of ways in which problems have been solved or not solved in a variety of contexts. In some ways, now that I think of it it's very similar to the ProjectLifeCycle described in most SoftwareEngineering textbooks. -- LarryPrice 

It was something I noticed after the fact, but it's not so strange given that any project involving more than a few people starts to form a community.

And lets not forget about patterns capturing the QualityWithoutaName. Lest we forget, Qwan is an aspect of living communities.

Patterns are generally confused with PatternForm. Many non-patterns can and have been written in PatternForm. It would seem patterns are something more than the structure imposed on them. Then, a ''pattern'' could be considered to be a story with ThreeExamples. This is a useful distinction to make because stories are usually interesting in their own right. I suspect this could lead to an internally consistent set of stories. This set might be referred to a StoryLanguage, a much weaker cousin of a PatternLanguage. Patterns are a subset of stories. -- SunirShah

I think that a pattern has to describe a problem and a solution as well, at very least, to be a Pattern. -- PhilGoodwin

----

I wonder if maybe the alexandrine form and it's derivatives are a bit too constrained of a definition of patterns, clearly CommunityLifeCycle is not a pattern in the classical sense, yet it does expose PatternsAndAntiPatterns in a way that seems productive. Perhaps we need investigate not just the MetaPatterns of DefinitionOfPattern and ValueOfPatterns but dig down into the roots of what makes a pattern, at least in the software world. -- LarryPrice

maybe PatternPrimitives
----
Aside from any DefinitionOfPattern, could we ask what is the ValueOfPatterns? How do they contribute and what do they contribute?
