'''ddd''', is a free graphical debugger front-end for *nix that can leverage any of the popular command-line debugger utilities.

I'm wondering if anyone here has had experience with it.  Good?  Bad?  I plan to give it a try, myself... my main mechanism of 'debugging' has always been optional runtime-tests and trace-statements along with careful analysis of code.  I've been wondering if this would make me any more productive.
