Very interesting! For attraction and repulsion of a different sort, have you ever noticed when humans, pets or animals of almost any type when facing a mirror, seem to be affected in much the same way, except humans have the added intelligence to know it's their reflection and are either enamored or repulsed by what they see.

I haven't observed it, but what do plants do in response to a mirror image?
