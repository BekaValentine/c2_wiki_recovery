Currently working on different Software Projects for my employer. I learn to be a PragmaticProgrammer, but I am still on my way...


Psalm 27,1a

Until now I haven't written anything useful on one of the wiki pages. But I am working on it :O)

I love reading books about SoftwareDevelopment.

MyLowestBookshelf looks like this:

* ''RefactoringBook'', (MartinFowler)
* ''EffectiveCeePlusPlus'' (ScottMeyers)
* ''ThePragmaticProgrammer'' (AndrewHunt and DavidThomas)
* ''The MythicalManMonth'' (Brooks)
* ''DesignPatternsBook'' (GangOfFour)
