by Thomas W. Malone. ISBN:1-59139-125-3

From intro:

''Imagine organizations where bosses give employees huge freedom to decide what to do and when to do it. Imagine electing your own bosses and voting directly on important company decisions. Imagine organizations where most workers aren't employees at all, but electronically connected freelancers living wherever they want to. And imagine that all this freedom in business lets people get more of whatever they really want in life: money, interesting work, helping other people, or time with their families.''

If they can live anywhere they want, companies would just outsource to cheaper countries.

Notion: The dream and the realities are far apart. The FutureOfWork will be shaped by the social forces that require it, not the workers who perform it. When work becomes available, the marketplace opens for those who will find they want to or must do it. The price of labor will be determined by the size of the labor pool in the selected market applying for made available positions. What people really want in life will be shaped by family or support structure they create for themselves. -- DonaldNoyes.20110829

''Imagine electing your own bosses and voting directly on important company decisions.''

Sounds pretty awful to me.  I'd rather let somebody else handle the politics and decisions so that I can get some actual productive work done.

{But often political decisions affect technical issues.}
