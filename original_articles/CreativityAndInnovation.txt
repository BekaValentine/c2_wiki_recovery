Creativity and Innovation in Information system organizations; J. D. Couger; Boyd & Frazer publishing company, 1996 [ISBN 0-7895-0109-0]

A good source for "structured" creativity; helps cope with the myth that creativity is just idea generation and innovation.

Not from this book, but inspiring is "Creativity is 1% invention and 99% stealing". Recognizing the good things in other contexts, in proven practice.
Seeing patterns?
