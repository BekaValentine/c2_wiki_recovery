She worked on the ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation (C3) project in Detroit, which is where she first started using ExtremeProgramming. Along with RonJeffries and ChetHendrickson, she wrote ExtremeProgrammingInstalled, a wonderful book that describes extreme programming and working on C3.

Ann has been actively involved in several ExtremeProgramming conferences, such as XpUniverse and XP2000-XP2002 (which were all held in Sardinia, Italy). She was the co-chair (along with ChetHendrickson) for OpenSpace at this year's XP Agile Universe which was held in Chicago.
