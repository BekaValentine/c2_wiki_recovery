I've seen a pattern whereby people who receive a given award become excessive jerks in the award category. They focus on that trait at the expense of other things. For example, if they get a "document esthetics" award, they start to obsess on document esthetics such that they waste time and resources on beauty. There is no counter "anti-productivity" award (or "productivity anti-award"?) to give them an incentive to be more balanced.
