	 :	"A History Of Vector Analysis"
	 :	by Michael J. Crowe,
	 :	University of Notre Dame Press, 1967. 

This book describes the history of not only Vector Analysis, but also QuaternionMathematics and the other algebraic systems as they developed from about 1800 until 1910, with some later information.  It gives attention to the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton (quaternions), Gibbs and Heaviside (vectors), along with Grassmann and Clifford.

''It describes well the state of things at the point where Hestenes started his work.''

''The one illustrated is obviously a new printing and may be updated. I have not seen it - I have the old one.''
