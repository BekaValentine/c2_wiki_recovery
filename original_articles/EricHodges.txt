I've started to write my own Lisp implementation in Java.  AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures convinced me (apparently subconsciously) that I need features only Lisp can provide.  I've been learning Lisp with clisp, but my inability to find a decent GUI package for Windows led me to the (perhaps insane) conclusion that I'd be better off writing my own Lisp in Java so I could use the Swing library.

This is the first time I've tried to learn a language by implementing it.  So far it's been a lot of fun, but I haven't reached macros yet.  The sense of "turtles all the way down" is quite visceral, even when I'm writing Java code that emulates bits that ought to be Lisp code.  I wish I'd done this years ago. -- EH
