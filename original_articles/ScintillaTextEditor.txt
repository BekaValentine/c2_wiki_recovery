But the really cool thing is that its engine, Scintilla is OpenSource as well, available for WindowsOs and LinuxOs (GTK), and easy to reuse in a lot of environments.

Actually Scintilla is just the text editing component. Scite is the text editor.
''Indeed, Scite stands for '''SCI'''ntilla '''T'''ext '''E'''ditor.''

SciTE is one of the best editors I've ever met. It requires some hardcore sex with its config files to become ergonomic, but after that it <trolling>is better than Emacs</trolling>. After all, what other ''freeware'' editor has human-oriented interface, folding, brace matching and 40 languages supported?

<trolling>Vim, perhaps?</trolling>

''Yeah, but guys, he rigged the argument by saying "human oriented". That means he automatically wins just by defining fans of other editors as non-human. ;-)''

I do. O'kay, MS Windows-oriented. jEdit, you say? Hm... It loads slowly, and I don't like the way it highlights matching brackets. Though it's a good editor, it seems. (See JayEdit)

''GeanyEditor has all that and is more oriented toward humans than SciTE. It also uses Scintilla''

----

Scite bundles with the PragmaticProgrammers' distro of RubyLanguage but, irritatingly, its scripts tune it slightly closer to Perl than Ruby. ''UseTheSourceLuke.''

----
Peculiarly, piping the selection through an external utility (as in vi's :!fmt) only works on Windows, not GTK.  That, combined with the lack of a reasonable built-in paragraph-justification command (as in vim's gq, EnEdit's ctrl-j, etc ...) makes it unusuable for email on *NIX.
