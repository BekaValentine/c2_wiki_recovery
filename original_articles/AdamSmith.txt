Adam Smith wrote "The Wealth of Nations." The "InvisibleHand" is his term for the force that makes human greed and avarice work for the general betterment of humankind. Not everyone believes that is true, but those who do consider themselves capitalists. -- John Van Voorhis

* ''It is important to remember that the 'InvisibleHand' is not just invisible, it is also myopic and not very bright ;)''
