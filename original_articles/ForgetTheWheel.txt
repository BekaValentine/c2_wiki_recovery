It seems that a lot of times when we ReinventTheWheel we do it just because we forget or even IgnoreTheWheel so, in our own context we might think were are inventing something really novel when in reality were are just repeating something that was done before

''Maybe we NeverFoundTheWheel.  Libraries of algorithms, patents, ideas, software projects, etc. are enormous.  We don't have anywhere near time to find them all, research those that might (but might not) apply to whatever problem we are solving, etc.''

Time for an IdeaGoogle?
