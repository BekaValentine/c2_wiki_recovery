If you find some one implementing a server for EJB2.0 please post it here:
	*EjbTwoWebLogicServer ''(only supports PublicDraftTwo, not the ProposedFinalDraft or ProposedFinalDraftTwo)''
	*OrionServer ''(supports ProposedFinalDraft)''

''(How can there be any EJB2.0 servers out when the spec isn't finalized?)''

Servers can implement the published draft specs. Most of the major vendors are doing development on their EjbTwo-compliant server while the spec is being written, so they can be ready to release quickly once the spec is final. Some are choosing to release their efforts for public consumption.
