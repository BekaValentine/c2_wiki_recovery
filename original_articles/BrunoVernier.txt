BrunoVernier on Wiki: "Collaboration is the purpose of wikis.  The idea of also including some structured, programmed learning is new and untested and just now being programmed in as an extra and only on my particular variant of wiki. One can EASILY ignore its existence and just pursue the pure collaboration aspect which *is* the wiki culture.

'''...'''Although wiki pages can be maintained by one person only (and I do that for some of my wiki pages), wherever appropriate and possible, we should encourage multiple maintainership, and even anonymous maintainership ... many wikis have a cvs like feature which can recover damage caused by errors or wiki-vandalism."  (Excerpts from a message at http://archives.seul.org/seul/edu/Jan-2001/msg00082.html)
