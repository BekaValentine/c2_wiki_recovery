LAMP originally meant: LinuxOs + ApacheSoftwareFoundation WebServer + MySql + PhpLanguage

LAMP is transitioning to mean: Any GNU-style host, any Apache-style WebServer, any SqlLanguage database, plus PerlLanguage or PythonLanguage or PhpLanguage or RubyLanguage or any cheap fast Inter'''p'''retedLanguage

Popular platform(s) for low-cost web serving and application deployment, and any element in the acronym can swap out. Any server platform can run any web server and any database with any scripting language to template the outbound HTML. The point of the stack is not the specific elements, it's the AlternateHardAndSoftLayers solution to the common problem of rapid web development.

Note that there are already a significant number of ready-made solutions to test and even deploy a full LAMP-type solution for various platforms. For instance, in the Windows world there is EasyPHP and Server2Go for ready-made, single click solutions. Others abound. See links below.

Additionally, there are virtual Linux environments for running under Windows, such as VirtualBox or VmWare. These systems can then host a LAMP application. This is easier to install than GNU-style packages configured to work under Windows through complex creations such as Cygwin.
