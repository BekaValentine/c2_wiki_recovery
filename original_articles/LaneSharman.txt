I am the principal engineer associated with http://opendoors.com. I just love wiki for its inherent ability to accrete knowledge and trivia and nonsense at the same time. This page is most of the latter.At http://opendoors.com you can find Conga which is a very neat GUI Builder.

I helped develop WebMacroWiki and you can download this the code from SourceForge. I did some work with Ant to make creating your own look and feel a little easier when building your own wiki. Also, the backing store for this wiki uses my infamous VeryLargeHashtable. You might want to check this out as well at http://opendoors.com/vlh. Not much there but the distro and a short example of how easy it is to make a Hashtable persist :(.

Feel free to email me. Love surfing, cats and Randi but not in that order in case she reads this :). Like a lot of us I am fully self-unemployed. Drop me a note anytime...mailto:lane@opendoors.com.

Thanks WardCunningham, for one of the great contributions to the net.
