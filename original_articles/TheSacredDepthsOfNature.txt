An interesting book by Ursula GoodEnough. She is a leading cell biologist. This book attempts to reconcile traditional religious beliefs and evolution. She considers herself a ReligiousNaturalist: She respects the sacredness and tradition of religion, but she doesn't believe in a "higher power".

The book is segmented into biological descriptions of evolution and life paired with personal reflections that dive into the religious feelings she has.
