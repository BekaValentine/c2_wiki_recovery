It would be nice if we lived in a world where discourse and presentations would be less about CriticizeCondemnComplain and more about PositiveDialogue. 

When you encounter such negative responses to something you have done, even though it is hard to do, you should not allow insults and other distractions to deflect purpose and direction. You may feel irritated and even outraged about such things, and they may affect your feelings, but instead, "let it go", replacing heat with light, and noise with signal. Often this takes place in other places where answers and information can be added which will be positively received. A WikiPage containing insults needs WikiGnome activity. You should not do it, because to do so will give way to the person making the insults and further an environment of disharmony. Be unswayed in your dedication to truth and purpose, insisting that both are possible and perhaps imperative in what should be civil discussion and presentation.

Not all questions deserve answers, especially when framed so as to insult, degrade or deflect. - See ConversationalChaff

Show in your public persona all your best qualities and works, work privately on your faults and shortcomings, making corrections as needed. It will show in what you do. Consider books and articles directed at self-improvement and refinement such as - "As a man thinketh", the "107-year-old timeless classic by James Allen".
