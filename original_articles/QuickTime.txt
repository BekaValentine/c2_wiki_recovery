QuickTime was the first major attempt ever at storing digital video in a not-too-terribly proprietary format. It has been around since at least 1991 ("Friends of QuickTime" is celebrating QuickTime's 10th anniversary.  See http://www.friendsoftime.org/).

QuickTime also has a very nice timing kernel inside of it. There were reports that a miller was using QuickTime to control the milling machines.
