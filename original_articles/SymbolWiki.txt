Symbolwiki ( formerly SymbolProject ) is a multilingual wiki project for artistic collaboration and debate in developing culturally-neutral symbols for representing distinct human concepts and ideas.  Working with others and by amendable principles and structures, the resulting glyphs should be easy enough to understand that they could be successfully implemented in pidgin-type experiments, where feasible.
