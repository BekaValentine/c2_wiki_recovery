If you are interested in LegoTechnicSystem patterns look at this article from the MitMediaLaboratory:

* http://www.ericalbrecht.com/technic/fundamentals.html shows technical bits (even though less precise than ArtOfLego)

Opening quote:
	 :	There is a real need for better resources for both fledgling and intermediate LEGO builders. The plans that the LEGO company distributes with its kits are very good at showing how to build specific models, but not so good at teaching how to design from one's own ideas.
