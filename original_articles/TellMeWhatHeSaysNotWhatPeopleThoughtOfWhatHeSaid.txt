There's got to be a better title for this page. 

Basically, it's a whine. I got a phone call from a recruiter the other day. And the conversation went something like this

	 :	"And you'll get a chance to work with <name I'd never heard>, who's world-famous for her work in distributed systems."

	 :	"Oh really ? I've never heard of her. Could you give me some references."

	 :	"Well, I don't have any. But she's highly respected."

'''scream.'''

I've had this conversation too many times. In our industry, home of absurd puffery and inflated claims, I no longer care who claims to be world renowned and who is well-known for something but sorry I don't know the specifics.

Give me thoughts. Concisely phrased, well-reasoned, actual-by-god thoughts. It's not that I'm skeptical, mind you, but simply that I need some filtering mechanism.

I love it!  I've had the same experience.  Another (related) one is listening to keynote speakers at conferences:

	 :	(1st attendee) "So what qualifies this guy to talk about this subject?"
	 :	(2nd attendee) "Well, he managed a big project that used it"
	 :	(1st attendee) "So does he know anything about it?"
	 :	(2nd attendee) "Probably not..."
