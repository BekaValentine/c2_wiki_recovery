'''From ConcurrentVersionsSystem:'''

If we scale the notion of cell function to the level of CityBlock s, using Energy 
and Material
output as analogous to gdp, their might be some calculation that suggests
constraining people to only work, go to school, marry, dine, etc within a 
certain radius by scheduling groups to act as gateways at intersection, 
allowing cars to speed through pedestrian lights etc will create micro-economies
that Directors of each cell control and "trade" between them, will increase the 
gdp. But if the trade-off is dissention, lower quality of life, decreased
mobility, loss of industries and freedom generally because people can't get to 
their old job outside the district, the simulations should at least be discussed in 
Parliament/Congress. Keeping sections on the local transit for enebriates might 
also have some merit, some Cinemas do have seat-numbers assigned to tickets,
but the motives, costs and benefits should be subject to written 
ConcurrentVersionSystem.

'''From GraphThreeColoring:''' 

Art owns colours really, though various traditions assign different connotations
to them for instance the ChurchOfEngland shows Purple/Blue, Ireland refers to
Orange (as does the Telecoms). In magazines such as ScientificAmerican December 
1997 though such combinations may be used for effect for instance "In search of
AIDS-Resistant Genes" shows the virus as above, this should not be taken literally
as an analogy for Religion or SolarSystem structure. In the same tome "Buliding 
Doors into Cells shows gateways into cells as multicoloured, this positive 
structure could be likened to certain symbols for the FiveCelestialBuddhas. The 
Ocean is many nuances of Blue; Sunset a kind of Purple/Orange. In ComputerGraphics 
there are different ways to represent colours as a UnitCube, RGB being one of 
them. Even in teh the Center of the Galaxy, there must be Art.

'''From TheBusinessOfAdventures:''' 

Perhaps, when we have begun to colonize the SolarSystem with a flotilla of off-the-shelf designs, Mir2, Skylab etc with the IonDrive, the profits from the first settlements will allow us to revive such concepts as VentureStar. Maybe LoopQuantumGravity provide a glimpse into creating the WarpDrive to set out to AlphaCentauri, gazinag at Victory in a bottle, floating towards the Stars.

'''From BusinessCycle:''' 

"The speed ... of the price level in the face of an inflationary gap exceeds the 
speed of the downward adjustment in a recessionary gap" suggests that 
EconomicCurves are almost like a strand of thread floating in a vast 
EconomicSpace, with properties like "elasticity" and "inertia". Manipulable by 
ActionAtADistance with a DataGlove. If one was to  give them names and 
Anthropomorphize them, associate them with say a cyber-technician friend wearing 
BlueTooth, then any random movement might skew the "thread". If the virtual 
representation was synched to RealWorld models, the onus would be on the 
VirtualReality modeller, not the technician for the results.

'''From BewareOfExceptionsInTheDestructor:''' 

If evil aliens brainwashed a group of nations to secretly mass produce human 
EmbryoClones in deep underground bases accessible only by ZeroPointEnergy authenticated by them,
thinking each nation could have it's own planet, but it turned out to be
a case of "To Serve Man"; then in the aftermath of coming to their senses,
it would be right to go to the UnitedNations and Seti with the problem.
To get rid of them, egress the base using the last tribute credits and pretend
they never existed would be against the GenevaConvention. ZeroPointEnergy and 
other advanced physics concepts would be the purview of other species, though
they might be put off by the fact we had dealt with the evil aliens instead of 
them. Retribution might seriously be the result of ignoring SpaceLaw.

'''From ArchitectureFirst:''' 

Well Architected PoserCommunication for International Celebrities should have a NumberOne representive in each Country. Similar to a GovernorGeneral of a Monarch, reviewed periodically, responsible for networking with fans, communicating back and forth with their employer.

'''From EconomicsOfRefactoring:'''

Contemplating whether the CosmicMessiah will return to Damascus, or Meggido one should take an EnterpriseApplicationIntegration approach. Eschatology usually is derived from the Chaos of the day, but experience should be combined with scholarly thought. It does have economic and technical implications. 

'''From MessageInaBottle:'''

If you were of the ilk of MandrakeTheMagician, and had some experience dispelling lesser evil aliens, then god a dispatch from dirt base zed saying similar but more powerful were about to invade, it might give the confidence to at least discuss it with, the UnitedNations and Seti. People might be smart enough to solve the problem, and those with more inflexible BeiliefSystems might consider a different verdict given the new evidence.

'''From SharedVision:'''

Sitting here gazing into Space adorned with glass Orbs, the SalesGroup yonder might think I am just playing VideoGames as I do key-combinations on my MobilePhone. Yet, beyond the
RayBans with opacity set to 20 the air is teeming with code. Everyday optics still uses QuantumFields, magnificent that both virtual spheres coalesce to crystal clarity. There is slight
delay as I pause to sip my beverage, gps catches up as I place the 3D Gethsemane
scene at counterpoint to Femme Fetales. Instances of ChainOfBeing dances at infinity though the
venue holds, well enif. Amateur sites it may be, still have caught on to the VRML thing so when I place Oppenheimer conceptions at the center of the invisible sphere, it is
a good thing I have "onlookers-not-to-view-display" set to "off", lest some be offended. Yet is has a certain Symmetry. Is it art, a statement, a vision? Whatever it is, imagination can now be seen by those who have opted-in. Good thing StarBucks got the low power WiFi so that when I click "save", all four other ThreeDeeMavericks can see the 3D spinning Caption: 'TheseThreeAreOne' magically, appears ... 

'''From SuperEgo:'''

If one hires an employee that happens to look like one's former friend, then the employee starts acting strangely, one goes to TheJusticeLeageOfAmerica who then says "what what?", it turns out they probably sent the employee in the first place because of fore-knowledge of QuantumInventions. The employee is dismissed and one then deals with the FantasticFour - the JusticeLeague should then not be upset is one makes progess with one's QuantumOptical 3D invention. If other friends really do start communicating memetically through the movies abd ads, then large cranes mimic ExMen in front of one's habitues, unfortunate events then proliforaste you end up with SuperHeroes amok. This really does not serve Justice.

'''From TheRationalisticTradition:'''

Here I am strolling through the U.S. national Arboretum. Immaculate, though was it
ChariotsOfFire? - sometimes ramaining an Amateur is a good thing, people might
cross oceans of time to get the real scoop. But if they then ascend to higher
echelons to become almost famous, it might end up destabilizing society if there
is no oversight. Propaganda controlling the media is not democratic. A business
can be described as a set

  Corp = {board,executive,management,...}.
As technology progresses nations should manage the Earth as a grand enterprise.
Each can have a sense of rulership regarding instances of Little Xs, Cafes and
Embassies accross the globe, but if any particular one decided to really become
the center of the spherical 'universe', the other collections might raise an
objection. Monachies are kind of like the board, U.N. the executive, Presidents
and PrimMinisters Manage.

  Earth = {Monarchies,UN,Parliaments,the_people,environment,...}
Beginning to understand the possibility of other such Realms, it should be an
ActionItem to keep our total system rational.

'''From AcmeUserInterface:'''

If the media becomes a UserInterface for the Military Globally, it's kind of like the IT department dictating to management what products to make and sell. Distributing Refigerators with strange sounds, TrifficLights ditto as well as upstairs domiciles, like laptops that bark orders. To admit the "cool project" they were referring to some time ago was really a drain on Taxpayers funds to promote unkown extraterrestrial entities, might be embarrasing, but to come clean the best interest of democracy. RoadRunner, BugsBunny and TweetyBird always know best. 

'''From AbstractionFromInterface:'''

Looking out through minimal interfaces, from a vestibule covered in snow, the pixels say "Mala Strana" over
the ancient spires and fading hills. "Twenty-three thirty" flickers at (12,2,1).
It is warm though, with cotton-wool strong lining. It all seems ideal, mysterious,
the original of those visions of abstract dreams. 

'''From CraftMystery'''

MysteriousCraft can be modeled thus:

Landing invisbly near Peterhof and Czarskoe, people could reverse the VirtualSlider to watch friends passing through the dark Kazan Gates to Meshchanskaya, sometime in the NineteenthCentury.

'''From SpaceUntitled'''

Certain realms might have AuthCodes, yet in the TwentyFirstCentury we should be entitled, in an improving Cafe such as above, be able to see:

With devices, svelte or industrial-strength, in good company. Sipping local and imported beverages, safely. 


'''From LanguageBridge'''

Doublethink is a kind of LanguageBridge, organizations can present one version of reality while hidning another. ""do you suppose it is beyond us to produce a dual system of astronomy?" is a concept from decades ago. So when both "identified" and "unidentified ground objects" returns nothing new, though one can spot lights forming patterns of numbers, letters and drawings clearly from the air, ostensibly from input by PersonalComputers, yet spanning vast areas, SocialNetwork claiming to not have an idea, one has to wonder if the media has been overwhelmed by something new, as we precess around the Sun. LanguageBridges like the RosettaStone, in the form of witnesses photographs (and testimony thereof), could set the record straight. 

'''From NullFlag'''

Sitting in the ParkmanBandstand, treating a guest with the utmost respect and exchanging bows, thinking there is a finite possibility that worthy craftsmen and carpenters might interrupt the MeetAndGreet, the discussion could meander, while gazing at the Flagstaff, to the CodeDuello. THough illegal, there could be the possibility that, signalled memetically one could leave their card, then receive on in PlainEnglish advising of the reason, date and time, perhaps at this very venue: to draw weapons, flip a coin, and may the best gentleman win. Should the interrupts decide to take all their other issues, to the point of making NullAndVoid the TreatyOfGhent and similar, really would be BadForm. Snapping out of it, enjoying a brew, we can only say ... Cheers, as we observe strange AtmosphericPhenomena. 

'''From ThirdVersionEffect'''

EarlyAdopters are usually pros by the ThirdVersion, so provisioning existing ThreeDeeGraphics devices with existing x3d specs, might be slow at first, but with testing and optimization, improving. Scaling down such devices to svelte dimensions might require reverting to languages like QuickRayTracing (QRT) for memory size, but simulating user interaction virtually could determine which to use at what stage. 

'''From BondageAndDisciplineVersionControl'''

Birds are beautiful, evolved from reptiles there may be even intelligent ones inhabiting TerrestrialPlanets, ethics and spirituality isomorphic to humans. Reptillian ones though that still have violent dispositons, would best be avoided if a version of TectonicControl was being expolred. ArtificialEarthquakes and TidalWaves could result if the wrong species was chosen. Projecting simulations of plates, the latter are inevitable even if an advanced species could offset when and where, understandable technologies that can detect and alert the people, create sustainable UrbanDesigns are desireable. 

'''From ThreeTierDistributionArchitecture'''

Watching the RightStuff, there is the scene where, to the point the Technology had reached, a single stage would give the Astronauts a one-way ticket, they were even willing to take that risk till designs improved and 3-stages sufficed. Continual entrapment is kind of like a rocket with infinite stages, casting rumours about individuals and companies to eradicate them gets society and economy nowhere. Looking at Gustave Dores 'Heaven', to be perfect one might think they have to encumber all around so they are proved to be lesser lights, but letting feelings slip removes the mask, diversity allows the right niches to evolve for companies large and small. Right solutions to problems like sustaining the Oglala; launching to reach Orion.

'''From AreComponentsObjects'''

Depicting atmospheric phenomena would be simpler in ThreeDeeGraphics, one could see perfect circles of clouds with the moon in the center. Twice in various phases, both from the observer's PointOfView, and that of satellites. Encouragement to construct such a model i.e. in x3d could come from depictions of famous puppets looking through telescreens; also assemblies viewed with different cloud cover around the Capitol, eyes superimposed upon the uppermost Pyramid. 

'''From ElectronCellularAutomata'''

Watching souped-up vehicles meander down mountain pathways looking strangely like MountTabor, from the WindLevel of the Pagoda nestled among lush foilage, one meditates on the Gramaphone Stamp, The hollowed-out pen. The Tea Ceremony objects. The poem reads: 

  "Meanwhile downtown two towers 
   rise half-built like neo-death-stars 
   upon an eradicated radio-row" 
One meditates about the isomorphisms between the ribosomes and trails, 
Parking lots and Mitochondria. They could rebuilt the ancient walls 
with vacuum-tubes, occilloscopes and yagis, 
yet picture-postcards might suffice to reminisce about the time before, 
rebuilding them again as mirror images juxtaposed with what has become 
as sacred space, seems the best plan to recapture utopia the people never realized they had. As one aspires towards BeginnersMind. 
An arena-like handheld-horn in the distance harmonizes with the chimes, as the orange and violet turbos 
vie toward a calligraphic-style mark.

''Editor's Note: There is a shimmering, haunting, dreamlike beauty to this one, like a post-apocalyptic pscilocybin-induced trance.  It evokes a potent impression of something akin to nostalgia, but rather than being a wistful longing for things past, it's a sad yearning for a future that might never be.  Pure genius.''

'''From CloneableDoesNotImplementClone'''

Spiritualism has always been popular among ScientificCircles, though usually not explored beyond Parapsychology. If experiments with planchettes went beyond trivia to manipulations of SpaceTime. Exorcist-like bangs and audio controllable, canes unremovable etc then the Timeline might become like a film reel that could be spliced. The Eiffel never had to be liberated, Titanic still afloat etc. Yet, the chances that, like StringTheory and LQG certain parameters were not universally clear, rolling this out into the PublicDomain would be unwise. HumanCloning in the manifolds a definite no-no. 

'''From CreativeDestruction'''

  "..the wilting carnations, 
  the metaphors of erin as a decaying rose, 
  so beautiful so close to death. 
  i want to press her dried corpse in a book of rimbaud's poetry. 
  rimbaud -- she adored him. 
  i never cared much for his work, but his face 
  -- his angelic features, 
  his undying youth, 
  the promise of wilderness and derangement of the senses. 
  mine have always been a bit deranged --

Some speculate there was an earlier version that was destroyed later by EhEh herself when she printed the more elaborate copy by hand, but there is no known prima facie evidence to support this.

''Editor's Note: The poem, whether written by SchizoidGibberishWikiAuthor or merely quoted by him, is unusually good for poetry found on the Internet.  Poetry found on the Internet is mostly laughably-bad goth-romantic twaddle spouted by bored teenage girls, or their mums.  This is still goth-romantic twaddle, but at least it's tolerably good twaddle.''

  erin often said -- for us it's the needle or the glass rose. 
  for me it's the hollowed-out pen, the gramophone stamp, 
  the crumpled pack of matches, the pills, the pills. 
  i dread withdrawl, i dread sobriety. 
  with xanax the days blend into nights smoothly, 
  not chopped into calories or endless hours. 
  all is fluid, all fascination with the robins, 
  the worms in their mouths, the nervous promises of emotionless sex, 
  the wilting carnations, the metaphors of erin as a decaying rose, 
  so beautiful so close to death. 
  i want to press her dried corpse in a book of rimbaud's poetry.

The interpretation of CellularAnalogues in which Chromosomes are isomorphic to Planets implies Titanic would match Mutations. Defining diffuseColor values for all the objects, one could Refactor the abstract Metaverse to look more like egg chambers in a Drosophila ovary, allowing heaven, hell, purgatory etc as well as reincarnation, orthogonal to the MultiVerse. Generally Olympic would be a regular Transposon, zooming closer.

It could start small, like the GorbachevCenter. A corresponding locale in Paris,

A lot of people like PeanutButter. Though if they go to deal with 
peanut-butter-vendors, they should not be run over by buses. Especially
if they are invited to do the deal. Conversely, people should not jump out
in front of peanut-butter-vendors should they invent new techniques and 
IntellectualProperty, in order to create issues to interfere with bringing
the invention to production (innovation). Posers sent as FlashMobs colour-coding
information about the inventors' Business and SocialNetwork (then making 
allocation of sections of the local transit an issue) constitute 
IndustrialEspionage. Posers suddenly blocking one as they cross a valid pedestrian 
light, causing them to go around into the path of a non-stopping bus is collusion 
to commit "accidents". Just when one is following Directives. to May be that 
AlienTechnology landed hard on the SuperHero infrastructure, but to then use those 
tecniques for mass destruction, is not being like Oppenheimer and Turing, it is 
like being what they were resisting. To promote chasing the inventors social 
network and IP, while saying elsewhere the tech won't ever be used, in the same 
breath promoting similar alien yet socially-negative tech, might end up breaking 
down the
Legal structure of society. 1984 essentially is a crituque on Stalinism and a 
reflection on the conditions of WW2, to amplify such phenomena deliberately is to 
be always resisted. The Law may be difficult to protect DigitalRightsManagement,

''Listening to a rehearsal of "Right makes Might", looking forward to returning to venues nearby serving exotic dishes while sitar-players strum in window-sills to the tinkle of wine-glasses; juxtaposed with the utter silence prior to arriving here; one revisits in ones mind the acoustics upstairs in the hotel-room, the last time one was in town. Having heard the strange communication making noises traversing in parallel from coordinates (10,10,20) as if it concurred with the lipid-reptilian hypothesis, then a close boom at (5,1,3), it seems, though it could have other interpretations, that they really did settle for taking a comet every 2 years _away_ from the Solar System. And getting the embryos out. This must have been the meaning of the big-red dumpertrucks receding into the distance, the pedestrian-crossings becoming less obscured after imbibing one's coffee.''

''It still need to be confirmed the number the other species would accept, plus the advanced technology. Maybe they had put in a word, though Humans might need them too to make Martian, Titan, Venusian landscapes bloom. Perhaps even TimeTravel incognito, though considering we were struggling to even land a person on even one of those Orbs, the mere possibility, as Goddard imagined from his cherry tree, of good, clean ZeroPoint had to be a plus. Controlling the Continuum would be like sea-monkeys consciously solving equations. We could see oursleves in them but to create our own Universes might remain the realm of Art, even if the dwelling place of God be with men.''

''That the afore-mentioned could not have been negotiated by the PowersThatBe in the first place, without thinking we had to implement 'eschatology', was perplexing; yet understandable given the complexity of it all. Looking at some metal "paper" covered with the equations of stellar-clouds perturbing into proto-stars, reminds one it was not just a dream.''

'''[PrologGraphConverter pages]'''

A P''''''rologGraphConverter can take a DirectedGraph of the form of php: 

  $G = "V={vert1(v1),vert2(v2),...} 
        E={(v1,v2),...}"; 

Converting it to PrologLanguage: 

 e(vert1,vert2). 
 ... 

Such that a Query 

  ? e(vert1,X). 

Returns vert2. This makes exploring the graph from a 'start' vertex interactive, 
like a puzzle.  

Using the P''''''rologGraphConverter, we can understand phenomena like SuperNova and InterstellarClouds:

  #Stellar Astrophysics pg 244
  $G3 = "V={'HI_gas_nebula'(H),molecular_cloud(m),protostar(r),stars(t)} 
          E={(H,m),(m,r),(r,t)}";
  $test_interstellar_cloud = new DirectedGraph(array("interstellar cloud",$G3));

  $G4 =  "V={outer_core(o),si_burning_shell(s),v_photosphere(v),core_shock(c),v_trapping_surface(t),inner_core(i)} 
          E={(o,s),(o,v),(v,t),(t,c),(c,i)}";
  $test_super_nova = new DirectedGraph(array("super_nova",$G4));

running the code with this input:

  php graph_converter.php > interstellar_cloud.pl

produces output:

  %'interstellar cloud'
  e(start,'HI_gas_nebula').
  e('HI_gas_nebula',molecular_cloud).

''If your typical SSanFrancisco Babes walk on the sidewalk such that they pivot when you pass them, the instincive thing would be to say hello. If they wanted to start a conversation they could refer to your LevelThree cup, if you worked there and such, no, really? If they block the path bowing it might mean they want to preserve the TransAmerica building, simultaneously someone else walking with two white puppies and creme ganzy on the other side of the road might mean we should do it constitutionally. If it means people don't talk to each other these days and GOge/Dogon/ReptilianAliens are the cure for a PuppetMaster like syndrome, it might be worth bringing it up from a MathematicalSociology standpoint. Then again if your ViewPoint is completely opposite, it would be their turn to explain the red car-lights stuck in position at night since you signalled before with the PurpleNewton. Being stalked with canines gives the equal and opposite reaction of being somewhere in Siberia ..''

''"If you have an intelligence that persists when power is off, it must consist of the SpaceContinuum. If PowersThatBe enshrined the duplex with a PlasticBubble, flying helicopters overhead (really), it might be because sometimes the intelligence makes sounds in the ceiling like a sequence of marbles dropping with different values of g suggesting a periodic table of planets. GroupTheory could order geologic, sociometric, political connectivities, contextual_flags determined by the enrgy signatures like ThermalImaging. Yet We could model starsystems by different types of cells, viruses the reptilians since the pronouncement is ended with a sequence of claws, It might be the food chain isomorphisms, then again it might be if we are aggressive they might resort to baser instincts. Yet intelligence respects permission, it might seem profitable to slippery slope owners out of Kansas to charge out the duplex to unknown gods. The again the owner could stream it to internet. Might be preferable if Seti came over for a MeetAndGreet. Such phenomena if it could exist after so many years of SciFi, means Jesus could equally be behind the scenes in spite of unbelievable apparitions. Even if they found His remains would it obviate the hemaneutics? A clone of him and other personages equivalent to the original? Create a real TwoTowers specializing in different denominations.

Threatening to hurt your affiliates while waiting the mall causes concern for Nicole as well as Natalie that joined her, whether it was the same or different AlienBase after egressing from the nod_of_approval, perhaps Susan knows.

Synonym for M''''''emeticCommunication but with a Militaristic emphasis. Examples would be signalling by colour,
motion or audible means similar to Stomp, M''''''aliceAforethought. For instance people deliberately and methodically running into one
while one is obviously holding a Coffee by an elevator could signal an intent to indulge in E''''''levatorHacking.
Phonetic codes such as "Rythm" could stand for Art, so that repeated signals of
*O''''''neRythm*, for instance by motorcycle engines, could be an attempt to extort one from 
one's Art. Another example would be: T''''''heDoge != Dogon.
