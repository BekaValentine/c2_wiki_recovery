I have added an RSS formatted version of the NewRecentChanges script.

The script takes parameters. Use smaller values of days as you update more frequently, use smaller values of min as you become more interested in minor editing.

I was inspired by Earle's script, but felt that this capability would be better coded on the host server, especially now that revisions in how recent changes are tracked make it easy. -- WardCunningham

12 hours is the default if you specify no parameters.

Could you add a pubDate in the RSS feeds ? That would be better for reader using the feeds and expecting a date -- AlexandreDulaunoy
