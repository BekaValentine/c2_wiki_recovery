How is it you FoundWiki?

Some people were exploring patterns. This, the first ever wiki, is devoted to software patterns.

	* From a link in the "ThinkingInPatterns" online book.
	* Learned of patterns from JimCoplien in a conference in Chicago; he recommended this Wiki - ''back when it was the PortlandPatternRepository, rather than the XpWiki.''
	* I came looking for the PortlandPatternRepository long ago. Did Wiki predate the GOF book? ''See DesignPatternsBook and WikiHistory''.
	* Found it while looking for J2EE design patterns. I left for half a year, then returned looking for XP information. A year later (May, 2001) I'm still here!
	* '''A UML Pattern Language''' [ISBN: 1-57870-118-X] by Paul Evitts. Just trying to stay on top of the game, or at least somewhere above the trough of the wave.

Others came here to learn about extreme programming. This site was the first, and may still be the largest site devoted to xp, though the xp list archive is probably bigger.

	* The XpMailingList.
	* http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html - ContinuousIntegration.
	* A friend told me about XP and I did a search on Extreme Programming. I found WardsWiki. Best search I can recall doing.

Some people found another wiki first and followed a link to here. 

	* While reading about the PythonLanguage, I encountered a page called ThinkiWiki. It had a link to PythonIdioms, a part of the Wiki.
	* I first found wiki when I discovered SeattleWireless' homepage, after initial confusion and shock a bit of thinking and some reading on MeatBall finished the process.
	* ZwiKi (ZopeApplicationServer Wiki).
	* I found Wiki through zWiki, and I came here to find out whet a Wiki is. I'm still not really sure, but that seems to be part of the fun!
	* TwikiClone installation at work

Others read about wiki in other publications.

	* A message on SlashDot. Then GoogleSearch to locate Wiki.
	* A message in the http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tiny-cobol-users mailing list.
	* From the comp.emacs mailing list. So many links, not enough time!
	* It is mentioned by a few LUA users; see http://www.lua.org/
	* Via news:comp.object, IIRC.
	* LinuxWorld '98 -> http://www.blackdown.org/ -> JavaOs -> JosWiki -> C2Wiki.
	* The O'Reilly book called 'Peer to Peer: Harnessing the Power of Disruptive Technologies' http://www.openp2p.com/
	* Freshmeat article.
	* CNET.com article - wow! Blogger/Livejournal on steroids! Looking forward to trying this system out.
	* Still another message on TidBits a Macintosh weekly news. 
	* Article at http://writetheweb.com/
	* Article in Fortune Small Business about collaboration tools: http://tinyurl.com/8cro9

Still others were turned on by friends.

	* From the LinuxOs guy at work!
	* I met Ralph Hodgson in a business meeting and we got off-track.
	* A friend recommended it.
	* My professor at the University recommended it in Programming Methods class.
	* A wiki user introduced me to it, thanks Richard.
	* Roger Hyam suggested we get into it - well done Rog.

Still more from people's home pages.

	* Via a subject-related link from a non-wiki personal-page to a Wiki home-page.

The patterns movement, and Wiki, were started by Smalltalk programmers.

	* I found Wiki several years ago (don't remember exactly how) while keeping up with what was going on in the Smalltalk community.

And a few more defy classification.

	* From a multi-step path of:
		1. Emacs Wiki-like authoring tool: http://www.gci-net.com/users/j/johnw/EmacsWikiNews.html ''(BrokenLink 2005-05-17)'' and
		1. Looked for Wiki language reference at: http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=955428&lastnode_id=48891 ''(BrokenLink 2005-05-17)''
		1. Ran into this web site's main page: http://www.c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki

	* A SlashDot story mentioned the GameOfNomic. I started to play WikiNomic, and I liked the WikiPart about it.
	* I was 'wandering lonely as a cloud, when all at once -------- '.
	* Now I come to think about it, I was looking for something completely different. Can't remember if I actually found it.
	* I was looking for information on J2EE application servers, techniques... The rest is history...
	* http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2001/7/25/103136/121
	* I honestly don't remember the first time. Wiki has always been there, in the world of me.
	* I found Wiki while looking at aspect oriented programming
