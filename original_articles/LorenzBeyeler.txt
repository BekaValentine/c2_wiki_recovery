I'm a programmer (engineer of computer science) working in Berne, Switzerland. Mostly projects with Java now. 

I'm the author of the SpaceOpera computer game (http://spaceopera.sourceforge.net). I have attempted to refactor (correct) some of my early blunders in this project, but there's still a lot to do, so don't be too harsh on me. 8-)

I like the Wiki concept very much (thanks Ward), but I don't contribute very much. Some correcting of typos and such. 

My favorite website is http://www.jerrypournelle.com/
