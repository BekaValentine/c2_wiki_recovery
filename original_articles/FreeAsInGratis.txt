Software which is available for no cost, but not available on terms which allow the user to receive, modify, and/or distribute source code.  Also known as FreeAsInBeer/GratisSoftware.  As opposed to FreeAsInSpeech/FreeAsInLibre/LibreSoftware

Examples of FreeAsInGratis software:

* InternetExplorer, before it got integrated into the WindowsOperatingSystems
* AdobeAcrobatReader
* Players for QuickTime, RealMedia, and other multimedia codecs
* MacromediaFlash player
* AmericaOnline client software (though this requires you subscribe to AOL in order to make any use of it).

Is there an example of software that is FreeAsInSpeech but not FreeAsInBeer?

* SCO thinks LinuxOs is :)
** ''But they're wrong. ;)''
* Many FreeAsInSpeech programs are available at no charge, but support costs extra (or require special hardware to be useful--i.e. a device driver)
** ''So you're paying for support, not software.''
* I paid $69.95 or thereabouts for a copy of SuSE Linux Professional; despite the fact that I could download the thing over the net--supporting the community and having the disks was worth it to me.
** ''You didn't pay for the software, you paid for the manual, the disks, technical support, and the WarmFuzzyFeeling of "supporting the community".'' (He gave them money, he got software in return. By any reasonable definition he paid for the software. It just came with more allowed uses than other software.)
*** Correct, though I could have legally (were I to choose to do so) borrowed a copy of the SuSE disks from a friend, burned my own, and installed that.  Wouldn't have come with the other things (manuals, support, and WarmFuzzyFeeling).

In general, one cannot impose scarcity on FreeAsInSpeech software (via copyright, licensure, or other means) in order to charge excessive "rents" (prices), as the terms of such licenses invariably permit the recipient of the program to redistribute it, possibly free of charge. This ensures that the marginal price of the software remains equal to the marginal cost -- which for software is zero (or near zero, depending on how the software is distributed).  In other words, you can't get rich selling licenses to free software; you have to provide something else of value to justify a price much higher than the marginal cost.
