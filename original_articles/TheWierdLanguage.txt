A true "graphical" language by ChrisPressey, the author of BefungeLanguage, in an attempt to reduce the number of commands required in a 2-D language yet still be TuringComplete. The instruction pointer moves in directions that are multiples of 45 degrees, along lines of non-space characters. The seven instructions are encoded in the angles between the lines of characters. 

Other sample programs and the language description are at http://catseye.tc/projects/wierd/

A program to print "Hello, world" in this language is visible at http://catseye.tc/projects/wierd/eg/hello.w

''Is "weird" intentionally misspelled in the language name?''
* It's supposed to be a cross between the words "weird" and "wired," according to the spec. See: http://catseye.tc/projects/wierd/doc/wierdspec.txt

This example program reads two digits from the console, adds them, and prints the result: 

  0   ****
   ***  *
        *
    ***  *
   *   * *
  ***  *  **
     *  *   *
      *  *****
       *
        ****
          *
         *
        *
       *


This one, "cat", pumps input to output until EOF is read:

  \                      / \
