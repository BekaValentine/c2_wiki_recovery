With the development of Tactical Missile Defense (which violates the ABM agreement with the Russia) and the willingness to initiate nuclear strike at non-nuclear states (which violates the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in UN), the UnitedStates is aiming at UnilateralAssuredDestruction. Namely, the destruction of target of the next US aggression will be assured.

The only possible response to this will be a race to build nuclear weapons and to build a lot of them to maintain its deterrent power in face of TMD.  As one columnist commented in 1999, if Yugoslavia has nuclear missiles, NATO will not dare bomb it.
