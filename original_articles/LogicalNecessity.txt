If you sequence your task network assuming that all the necessary resources will be made available at the earliest possible moment, and the only consideration is that internal task deliverables that influence a succeeding task are available -- then the resulting network exhibits logical necessity and the plan resulting from analyzing that network will be the AbsoluteBestPlan -- no better plan is logically possible so long as the task analysis is correct.  The ActualPlan is obtained from the absolute best plan by incorporating resource limitations such as availability of staff, equipment, etc. these delaying elements produce LogisticDelay. -- RaySchneider
