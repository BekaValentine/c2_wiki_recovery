RSS is an acronym for many members of a family tree, common expanded names are RichSiteSummary, ReallySimpleSyndication and RdfSiteSummary. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28protocol%29). Such feeds are typically branded with an icon (http://www.feedicons.com/images/layout/feed-icon-12x12.gif).
WardsWiki (this site) has a RecentChangesRss.For RSS feeds we need RSS Aggregators.

In Aug05 MS attempts to use '''"WebF''''''eed"''' as a substitute name for RssFeeds. The company gets labelled by DaveWiner at his blog entry at http://archive.scripting.com/2005/08/13#meanInternationalSoftwareMonopoly 
* source of this controversy started in an IE blog at http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/08/02/446280.aspx. It was suggested future support of AtomSyntax made it unwise to use the term RssFeeds
* In defense of MicroSoft, it was reported that MozillaFirefox and Google did similar attempts before. And that analysts support this name change because it reduces the barrier to adoption by end users. See http://www.marketingvox.com/archives/2005/08/21/microsoft_web_feeds_friendlier_than_rss/

RdfSiteSummary is the title of version 1.0 of the RSS specification.
* This version has not been deemed to be successful compared to its successors described below. 
** Adam Bosworth said it failed because the spec attempted to tackle the "(unattainable) Universal Truth", and as a result got too complicated for users with simple requirements.
* RSS 1.0 is still preferred in cases with specialized needs (e.g., the publishers of the scientific journal ''Nature'' have used it to incorporate PRISM metadata in a consistent manner).
* An updated version, RSS 1.1 (bug fix) was made available Jan05. See more at http://xml.coverpages.org/RSSv11-Announce.html

ReallySimpleSyndication is the title of version 2.0 of the RSS specification.

AtomSyntax is intended to do similar things (to RSS2.0) but not initially designed to conform with any RSS specs. It attempts to address more complicated needs than RSS V2 but the spec is not yet finished.

'''Rss Enclosure - going beyond plain text '''

various experiments started to enrich enduser experiences, made possible by 0.92 spec in 2000. See http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/print.php/3431901

'''Podcasting''' uses an RSS2.0 formatted feed that encloses MP3 files. Requires a compatible reader (not on PocketPc yet). See http://www.msmobiles.com/news.php/3232.html

''I am looking for a common freeware that mingles various feeds within one folder together. Any one knows of one?''

*These feeds may come in different Rss formats, but I would like them to appear like a single feed to me as a user, ordered by date/time.
* Very useful feature for me as I now have 5 or more feeds just on technology news, and some of the sources have similar stories.
