Implemented as a CGI program written in the AdaLanguage. Minimal wiki-like behaviour. Invented independently by MariusAmadoAlves in the late 1990's, before he discovered WardsWiki in 2000. Casbah II adds an Archive function designed to protect data. An installation is available at http://www.liaad.up.pt/~maa/. Source code available under a ProgressiveLicense.
