''When dealing with new and potentially interesting artifacts, a good question to ask'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20110915
----
Where to start? - Some Questions
* What is unique, similar, different about the artifact?
* Some would also want to know how new (modern) it is, and what it has as major features and attributes.
* Is it scarce, expensive or hard to learn about?
* How did we find this in the first place?
* Ask as well:
** Why is this important?
** Why ignoring this might not be a good idea
** ShouldIbeginToUseThis
** WhyNotStartToday
----
In Making Decisions
* The first step in making a good decision is to grasp what the decision entails. Without a proper understanding of what is being decided upon, no good decision can come about.
