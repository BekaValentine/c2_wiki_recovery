LanguageIndependentProgramming is an ideal from LanguageOrientedProgramming. 

----

LanguageIndependentProgramming means that programmers should try to reduce the impact of the programming language used on the design and implementation of their programs. 

----

It is an idea of long term reuse of code. Changing the programming language or switching the operating system should not force a project to be completely rewritten. 

----

LanguageIndependentProgramming may be realized on various levels. Functions like :
     S''''''trClear(s)
     F''''''ileDel("backup.dat")
     C''''''ustomerIdSetEmailAddress("001274","leitner@hls.via.at")
may be implemented in BASIC just as well as in C or Java. They are small but important steps toward more portability and independence from the underlying programming language, operating system or database. Using the ThelopLanguage this way means to wrap more basic functions of the programming environment to increase portability.
