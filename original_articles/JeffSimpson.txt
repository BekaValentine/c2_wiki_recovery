Previous to that, I spent about a year watching dot-coms become ''dot-gones''.  Wasn't pretty. I kinda got burned out from total company meltdowns while I was doing some of the best engineering I've ever done.

I used to be a consultant for GemStone in the days before the ''fall''. Got to know a couple of extremely talented people there.

Before that, I spent several years programming in Smalltalk, C, C++ and Fortran.

I spent the first 5 years of my professional career doing Biomedical Engineering for Harvard and University College London.

And the first dime I ever made programming was building and running a computer dating service. That was fun.
