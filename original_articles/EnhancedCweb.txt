'''Enhanced CWEB''' is a LiterateProgramming tool, for C programming. Output format is Plain TeX. It consists of three programs, CTANGLE, CWEAVE, CSPIDER. It is very powerful, due to powerfulness of TeX, due to chunk names, due to the advanced preprepreprocessor and prepreprocessor, and the C preprocessor.

Features include:
* Nicely formatted printed codes and documentation (but a bit different from normal CWEB)
* Code generation in interpreted C
* Metamacros which can deal with output of both C and TeX codes
* Can create multiple output files (both with C and with TeX)
* Option to use blackboard bold
* Allow to create include files which are partially or fully hidden from the printout (weaving them by themself will suppress the hiding)
* Change files
* Chunk counters
* ...various others
