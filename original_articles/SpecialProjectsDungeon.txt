Where incompetent (or out-of-favor) managers get sent, often as a prelude to getting sacked.  (Though not always). 

It's a common pattern (AntiPattern?) in industry when an upper-level manager is relieved of his/her duties (for poor performance or issues with the boss; see below), rather than being terminated directly he/she is assigned to run one or more "special projects"--some minor project activity usually of low importance to the company (otherwise the project would have a higher profile and not be given the label "special project"--it would be a full-fledged project on its own).  The assignment can serve several purposes:

* Gives the company time to decide what to do with the manager.  Another department may take the manager in to fill an opening.  (especially if the manager lost his/her previous post due to a conflict with his/her boss, rather than due to performance issues).  If no takers, then the manager gets the boot.

* Provide a subtle hint to the employee that his opportunities for further advancement with the company are limited, and that if he/she wants to ClimbTheCorporateLadder he/she needs to do so elsewhere.  (See UpOrOut)

* Humiliate the manager in order to encourage her/her to resign voluntarily (rather than firing him/her and having to pay a settlement package). ''This one can expose you to a constructive dismissal suit in the UK''

* Give the manager one last chance to redeem themselves--if they successfully manage the special project (not always easy, given the low priority afforded to such projects) they might be given more responsibilities.  Otherwise, HastaLaVista.  

Note that managers/employees who commit acts of misconduct generally aren't sent to the SpecialProjectsDungeon; they are just canned outright.
