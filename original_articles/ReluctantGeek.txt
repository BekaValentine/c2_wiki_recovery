A ReluctantGeek is someone who deep down knows they are a geek but have a hard time acknowledging it.  They may or may not have had a proper ComingOut and prefer not to attract too much attention to their geekiness.

''The reverse version is also possible. Deep down one might know one is not a geek, but have sufficient knowledge and capability with technology that others often assume they are.''
