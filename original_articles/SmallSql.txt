SmallSQL Database is a 100% pure Java DBMS for desktop applications. It has a JDBC 3.0 API interface currently. This database is for desktop applications only (standalone applications). It has no user account and no network interface. This make the installation and using very easy. You need only to add the jar file to the classpath of the application.

It supports 4 transaction isolation levels and most of the standard SQL syntax. It has a very small footprint of approx. 200 KB for a JDBC 3.0 driver and DBMS.
