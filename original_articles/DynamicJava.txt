From the homepage http://koala.ilog.fr/djava/, with minor edits:

''"DynamicJava is a JavaLanguage source interpreter. It executes programs written in JavaLanguage, like described in the JavaLanguageSpecification, in addition with scripting features. DynamicJava was written in pure JavaLanguage, is free and distributed with the source code."''

Like the BeanShell and JavaPython, DynamicJava makes more use of the JavaVirtualMachine's dynamic features than "real" Java.
