With all the lately discussion on normalization in FearOfAddingTables, SafetyGoldPlating, NormalizationRepetitionAndFlexibility, etc, etc I realized that since all those involved in the discussions (or those only reading them) have been involved in different project with different database designs, that makes it hard  to agree on what is a properly normalized model, or if tables are too wide or too thin...

So I have been wondering if any of the main participants in the discussion have read TheDataModelResourceBook and any of them could offer a opinion of whether the models in there are  properly normalized, are too wide or too thin or seem to be useful for real world applications.
