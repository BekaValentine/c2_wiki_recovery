	WilliamEdwardsDeming:	"Rational prediction requires theory and builds knowledge through systematic revision and extension of theory based on comparison of prediction with observation. ... It is an extension of application that discloses inadequacy of a theory, and need for revision, or even new theory.  Again, without theory, there is nothing to revise.  Without theory, experience has no meaning.  Without theory, one has no questions to ask.  Hence without theory, there is no learning."

In theory, the difference between theory and practice is small. In practice, the difference between theory and practice is large.
