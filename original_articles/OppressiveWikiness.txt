When you read a wiki page that has huge amounts of wiki links, and you get recursively caught up in the wiki links to the point that you wander around the web and wiki until four in the morning without ever finishing the original page.

''Try clicking on the titles of pages for cross links.  It is like getting thrown into the Nth dimension of Wiki.''
