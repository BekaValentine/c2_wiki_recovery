''When you are concentrating on turning notions into ItWorks code, you pass through three stages'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20121126
*Stage 1 - You desire 
** It is a desirable notion or feature, fulfilling a practical computing need
*Stage 2 - You do the work of making it so
** Because it is possible to accomplish it with resources available and within a reasonable period of time
*Stage 3 - You complete it! ItWorks
** It becomes a working artifact, satisfying the original notions
