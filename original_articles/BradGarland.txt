I am a web application developer in Sydney, Australia.

I began investigating patterns when I started working in C#.NET.  After repeatedly referring to MartinFowler'''''''s PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture book, the team began communicating ideas much more easily.

Then I switched jobs and found RubyOnRails came with so many of the patterns we were already using that I've been using it ever since.
