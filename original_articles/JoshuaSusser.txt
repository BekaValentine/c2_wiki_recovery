Sometime in the last few years when I wasn't paying attention, someone used this as a test page. Oh well, I'm sure I didn't have anything too interesting here.

In some odd language, "Brush With Greatness" could be my middle name. I've been lucky to work (and play) with some great people, including Kent Beck, Alan Kay, Dave Ungar, Ward Cunningham, Alan Wirfs-Brock, and Babatunde Olatunji. I spent many years working in Smalltalk-80, did this thing at Apple called OpenDoc, and was a principal designer of the JavaCard Virtual Machine spec. Now I'm at EarthLink managing a software development team, where I was happy to find someone else set up a Wiki before I even got there.
