SiliconValley has been described as a state of mind,
but it's also a real place,
where the frenetic workaholic pace is
exceeded only by the cost of housing.

SiliconValley is a meeting place for a lot of interesting, very intelligent and brave people. My personal experiences in the valley has been mostly pleasant. The birth place of most DotCom's, it is also currently a graveyard for many. The climate is wonderful, matched only by the politeness of people.
