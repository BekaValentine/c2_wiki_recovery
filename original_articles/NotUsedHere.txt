I think ideas NotUsedHere can be discussed here, even it they are not used here. Ideas NotUsedHere may be a GoodThing when applied to a PersonalWiki or other WikiSpaces. Do not take it that because something is NotUsedHere, that it is necessarily not to be discussed here or used quite profitably elsewhere.  

For Example:

It is a GoodThing to enable IntutitiveBrowsing through an IdeaSpace which happens to use WikiDevices such as WikiPhrases, WikiGroups, WikiTags, WikiBadges and WikiTokens in your own ControlledAndDefined PersonalWiki. 

If movement through a Wiki IdeaSpace is helped by the use of WikiDevices such as these and they are not handicapping the movement in the space where they are placed, it would be a handicap, not to use them.
