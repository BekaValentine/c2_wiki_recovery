In gentler words - the kind of work your WikiGnome does. Categorizing pages, fixing typos, removing your signatures to ease refactoring, etc. These are usually considered a GoodThing.

On the other hand, some view this as a problem, because it causes more entries in RecentChanges.
----
The focus of this wiki is textual content, not perfect punctuation and presentation.
* Don't reflow paragraphs by removing newlines. This does not affect the appearance of the page and just clutters recent changes.
* Don't convert between the various forms of dashes (EmDash, EnDash, -, --, –, —).
* Don't prefix every signature with '--' just to satisfy the SignatureSurvey.
* Don't convert British spellings to American spellings (color/colour).
* Don't just insert/remove commas, periods, etc.

Currently, there is an automated SharkBot which will revert these kind of edits.

But do FixYourWiki.
* Fix obvious spelling mistakes and poor grammar, but only if it '''aids understanding'''.
* Add and fix WikiLink''''''s.
* Convert broken character encodings to UtfEight (there was recent breakage due to a server upgrade).
* Add bulleted lists.
* Refactor pages to improve structure and reduce duplication.

For ''new'' content, please try to follow the WikiStyleGuide.

"...removing your signatures to ease refactoring..."

I cannot object to this practice strongly enough. When I put my signature on a particular contribution it is because I want my words kept as is. There have been times in the distant past when something I said was buggered up by someone wanting to "streamline" or "correct" one of my statements. Instead of improving my contribution these do-gooders screwed the pooch badly. I wish my statements to be left alone when I sign them.

On the other hand, I have made plenty of contributions to this Wiki that were unsigned, sometimes with my name added to the list of contributors at the bottom of the page. This is a great way to let any involved WikiGnome sort out the ThreadMode diatribe into a more concise DocumentMode statement of ThesisAntithesisSynthesis and still maintain one's tracking of ongoing discussions.

Please don't remove signatures without asking the original author of the statement.
