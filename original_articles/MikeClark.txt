'''Another interest'''

''You may know me as a software developer who owns and runs a technology training company.'' 

''But I also have a passion for nature and wildlife photography.'' 

''My love of the outdoors and wild critters is rooted in the heritage of being a Montanan.'' 

''It's only in recent years that I discovered photography as a way of expressing what I see and how I feel when I'm out in nature.''
