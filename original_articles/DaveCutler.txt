''A respected Operating System designer.''  The Digital folks didn't seem to have much respect for him when I worked there in 1996-1997.  And it was not just about his jumping ship: there were criticisms of his management style and technical achievements. --GeorgePaci

And I spent 6 happy wonderful years at DigitalEquipmentCorporation in the eighties (not the MBA influenced 95-96 version when most of the talent had left) and I can say with most certainty that most of our engineers regarded him as a God. VMS had things 20 years ago that most operating systems still haven't achieved. Abrasive, yes, but most geniuses are. Rashid (the MachMicrokernel guy) respects him as do most heavy OS designers. That's good enough for me.
