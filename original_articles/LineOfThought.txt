''Ever think of things as points, lines, surfaces, spaces and beyond?'' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.2011
----
My most recent line of thinking has been introduced to a new way of visualization, expression and models:

Example - My present Desktop Background is a representation of the internet as points and lines enhanced by displaying lines with different colors. It can be seen as a single page.

Visualizing:
* The Internet as a treemap - Visualized as points and lines
* Top 100 WebSites - Visualized as SquareSpaces
