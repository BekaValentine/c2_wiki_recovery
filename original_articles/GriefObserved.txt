The Correct name of the book is ''A Grief Observed'' by C.S. (Clive Staples) Lewis, noted Christian apologist and the author of the beloved children's fantasy series "The Chronicles of Narnia". [ISBN 0060652845]

The book is a series of his thoughts (recorded more or less chronologically) on the death of his wife, Joy Gresham Lewis from cancer. It's a powerful and moving book; I recommend it to anyone.

For a better understanding of the life of C.S. Lewis and especially his relationship with his wife, I recommend renting the movie "Shadowlands". C.S. Lewis is portrayed by oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, and Joy Gresham Lewis is portrayed by Debra Winger. An excellent film. [''The original version, with Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom, was also fine.''] For more on C.S. Lewis, see http://cslewis.DrZeus.net/.
