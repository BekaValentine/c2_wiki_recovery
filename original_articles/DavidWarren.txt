I am transitioning from a company that wouldn't make the transition to OO development to one that will--or already has. I am like the auto-didact in Sartre's _Nausea_: I know all the words, but I don't know how to pronounce them. That means, I have read most of the standard publications on patterns, but I have yet to find my own voice. Maybe this is a start.

I hang out at mailto:dwarren@earthlink.net.
