Consider the doubling of single words to form LinkPattern''''''s. Although it's not common practice, it can be found at the heart of Wiki. See: WikiWiki, Category''''''Category.

Example: JunitJunit (for Junit, instead of JavaUnit)

Contrast with these (less-beautiful) single-word examples: WiKi, LeGo, LaLa, and WaWa. They are all ugly.

''Actually, Neither WikiWiki nor Category''''''Category is a DoubleWordLinkPattern.''

The instances above are
 DoubleWords

 and constitute a pattern

If that isn't a DoubleWordLinkPattern, then what else is? (remember RefactorByCondensingQuestionAnswerPair when answering)

 (note the title of this page may well be a MultipleWordLinkPattern.
