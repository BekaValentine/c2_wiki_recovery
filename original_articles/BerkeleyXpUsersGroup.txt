They have big tables, coffee and food and are open all night. 

'''Dec. 31:''' We will be discussing the Leuf and Cunningham's "TheWikiWay:Quick Collaboration on the Web"

We are focused on the benefits of face to face discussion. We learn new things, find new references and meet new people.

'''May. 18, 2003:''' Based on the last edit date, the Dec. 31 above is 2001.  Anyone interested in resuming these Berkeley meetings?  If so, please e-mail me (David Montgomery) at montgomery at gamesgrid dot com.
