Implemented from hints from the operations of the SmallestFederatedWiki, the following is a SimpleMinded approach which allows multiple pages to be displayed and to be scrolled independently within a single browser pane within the display space of one monitor perhaps in a set of MultipleMonitors.

Construct a page including the following html (this will display albeit in a default very small frame the two pages side by side:

 <iframe src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanPages"></iframe>
 <iframe src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanUsers"></iframe>

Fit the two pages into a slightly larger arrangement by making them fit side by side within a space of 640 by 480:

 <iframe width = 300 height = 450 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanPages"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 300 height = 450 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanUsers"></iframe>

Or if you have a much larger monitor as in LargeFootprintComputing, or don't mind if the pages are stacked to fit try:

 <iframe width = 300 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 300 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanUsers"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 300 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanPages"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 300 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtendedLink"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 300 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UsefulUsableUsed"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 300 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage"></iframe>

I try these out by using my TextPad program and saving the trial html as ''test201210140618.htm'' and then using its top menu select View, In Web Browser to see what results. 

You can substitute other widths and heights to suit you fancy and even stack the items including many more pages in the same window by using <p> or <br> (widths were changed to utilize wider sub-pages):

 <iframe width = 400 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 400 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanUsers"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 400 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWithMoreThanPages"></iframe>
 <p>
 <iframe width = 600 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ExtendedLink"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 600 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UsefulUsableUsed"></iframe>
 <br>
 <iframe width = 600 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage"></iframe>
 <iframe width = 600 height = 750 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FindPage"></iframe>
----
Note: I purposely left out <html><head><title>This Is a Test</title></head><body> followed by the trial code and then </body></html> which would make the code a more complete page, but most browsers will display the code in a useful manner regardless of the ommission.
----
Here is the page W''''''ikiWikiSandbox html code where the edit page and the displayed page are side by side. You may substitute any page you like in the code.

 <head>
 </head>
 <body bgcolor=beige>
 <iframe width=500 height = 900 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?edit=WikiWikiSandbox"></iframe>
 <iframe width=750 height = 900 src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiSandbox"></iframe>
 </body>
 </html>

In a WikiWithMoreThanPages - this could be the default edit screen for a page. It would display three buttons instead of one button - one called "testedit" to test changes, the "save", and the third "no change" to exit with no changes in the wiki page being posted. 
* try display as is: (not having a wiki on my home site, the two extra buttons are omitted)

Why not use FrameSet's? That way you don't have to hard-wire the widths, and the user can drag the sub-windows larger or smaller. 

Good idea! - I tried it and ItWorks!

For readers: WeNeedExamples:

try:
  <frameset rows="90%,10%" cols="33%,33%,33%">
   <frame src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiSandbox" name="wwsb">
   <frame src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?edit=WikiWikiSandbox" name="ewwsb">
   <frame src="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges" name="rchg">
  </frameset>

There is a hidden agenda in using rows equal in the first line, can you think of what it is?

The problem with using the frame / frameset combination is that it appears that they will not be found in Html5, however iframes will be included.
