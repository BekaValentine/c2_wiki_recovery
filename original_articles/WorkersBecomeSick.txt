Too much overtime makes workers rest too little and then become prone to become ill.

A project may fail because key developers become ill.

Many of the topics you are creating have been covered in other pages (in this instance, probably PlayHurt). Could you please make sure that you're not duplicating information. Strive for OnceAndOnlyOnce.... or should that be LessRedundancy... or EliminateDuplication...

Become is a very good word, which is a very descriptive word indicating a change as a result of. Duplication is also a word used as a thing to be avoided, yet is used extensively in programming nonetheless. Consider how many times "Hello World", printf, sub, function, add, etc. are used! And the admonition if it is used over and over (at least three times) make a pattern. And please tell me what is a pattern used for?  ... nothing less than for duplication.

WorkersBecomeSick has potential for many more ideas than the two proposed. They become sick more often by being expected to produce something in little time with little idea of what the something is supposed to be. They become sick because they are subjected to stresses and pressures placed upon them by people who talk but do not listen, who issue orders but do not supply resources, who set dates without considering whether such dates are realistic or whether even remotely possible. They become sick because their good work is overlooked when something beyond their power of preventing it causes things to go wrong. They become sick when they are forced to make estimates based on nothing and are then held to the estimate when nothing is furnished allowing accomplishment. They become sick for many reasons, having little to do with "Playing Hurt". They also become sick of those who can only criticize!
