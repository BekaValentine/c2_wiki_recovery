A Wiki Site, in operation for since Fall, 2001 by DavisFoulger, that is focused on discussions of Human Communication Systems.  Much of the content is comprised of lecture notes for various classes within the general subject matter.

The site is operated using a highly customized version of the QuickiWiki software.  I don't think any part of the code isn't more mine that Smith and Cunningham at this point.  The biggest and most useful innovation, in my view, is a variant table syntax that allows Wiki tables to be built in a very flexible manner.
