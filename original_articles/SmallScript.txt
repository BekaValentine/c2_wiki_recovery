From the website:

Smallscript Corp's S# language implementation is a complete redesign of the SmalltalkLanguage, offering transparent cross-language integration and component based deployment. Capable of supporting both repository and industry standard file-based source code management, it offers a rich array of streamlined features which enhance the Smalltalk language with features familiar to users of languages such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Microsoft Visual C# .NET, Visual Basic .NET, and many popular scripting languages.
