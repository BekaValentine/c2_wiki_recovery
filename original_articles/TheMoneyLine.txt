A term from standup comedy, referring to the punchline in a routine.

At my current team, we have taken to calling "'''The Money Line'''" (with the "'''The'''") these details:

* in production code, the line in a positive branch that will proceed down the call stack towards a profitable side-effect
* in test code, the '''Activate''' line in the AssembleActivateAssert pattern

We find this verbiage useful, because sometimes we refactor TheMoneyLine away, and have to find it again!
