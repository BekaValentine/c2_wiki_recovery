What is the criterion to add a page to this category? 

''These are all items that would be CategoryOffTopic, but they're too rich for us to ever part with. Part of what makes wiki wiki.''

Shouldn't pages that are actually favourites be in this category which are definitely not just the off topic ones.

''Most of those already have their own category. Heck, most of those already ''are'' their own category.''
