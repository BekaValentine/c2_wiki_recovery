A Qomp Implementation is a specific standard or specific version or specific compiler for (or specific implementation of) QompLanguage

As of 2008 only one Implementation of Qomp is being worked on, but anyone is free to implement QompLanguage once more structure is in place that describes concisely the QompLanguage.
