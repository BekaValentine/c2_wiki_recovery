---'''In Other's Words - Dogfooding '''
Dogfooding can be a way for a company to demonstrate confidence in its own products. The idea is that if the company expects customers to buy its products, it should also be willing to use those products. Hence dogfooding can act as a kind of testimonial advertising.

It's also a very good QA strategy.  Many bugs won't show up until real customers use the product; if your own developers are the first users, you don't tarnish your name releasing shoddy products and have a much shorter feedback loop, speeding up development cycles.  The risk is that your developers will tweak the product to specifically fit their needs to the exclusion of those of the paying customers.
