''hello. what exactly do you mean by internet systems?''

Hmmm, I mean mainly e-commerce systems, but a few other things as well. I have a strong interest in all aspects of software design, have written all sorts of things, from a web server (purely for the hell of it) through to large-scale web applications for the world's largest purely online bank, Egg.
