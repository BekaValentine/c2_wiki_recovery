Dear WikiPrinciplesDeleter (IP 62.141.58.13):

You deleted the page WikiPrinciples several times in a row, so that I had to recover it twice from the GoogleCache.
WikiPrinciples is one of the oldest pages here in WardsWiki and it is needed for
* internal backlinks
* reference elsewhere in the Web, e.g. for applying the WikiPrinciples to ConceptMaps.

As the TwinPage at the MeatballWiki complements the WikiPrinciples page, but doesn't replace it, please give your argument, why you want have it deleted. -- FridemarPache

''That's GrammarVandal. He's trying to get past the SharkBot by deleting the page and then restoring it with his changes.''

Thank you for the hint. -- FridemarPache

* Also, you will find the correct version of that page to be: http://c2.com/wiki/history/WikiPrinciples/106.
