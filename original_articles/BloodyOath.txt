Strine for "emphatically".

''Please use in a sentence so we can see how an apparent noun phrase gets used adverbially.''

The page where the phrase originates (StlPort) seems to use it in a similar context to ''hell yes'' and ''hell no''.  However, bloody oath seems to be a bit more generic that yes or no, so the yes or no is to be inferred from the context.  Of course, this phrase may have additional uses.

''Do I know what BloodyOath means? BloodyOath I do!''

Eager students, please note the two different uses of the same WikiName reference in the two sentences. Bloody Australians.

''Ah.  It's a typed MetasyntacticVariable!''

We just take HumptyDumpty's approach to language. And, of course, all our words get paid at least MinimumWage.

''Is this related to the usage of BloodyHell?''

''Does ''strine'' mean Australian?''

Yes, in a RatBag kind of way. I think the term arose from a book entitled "Let Stalk Strine" which was supposed to be phonetically equivalent to "Let's talk Australian" when said with an Aussie small-country-town drawl.

Such "cute" language send-up books are widespread. For example, there's one about the Bristol (UK) accent, entitled "Krek Waiter Talk Bristle" ("Correct way to talk Bristol").

''Bloody Poms. "Let Stalk Strine", by Afferbeck Lauder (a pen name for Alistair Morrison), lifted from contributions to the SydneyMorningHerald column of the same name, circa 1965, is a miniature classic. Oh, it's no SentimentalBloke or MagicPudding, but it deserves reverence as an icon, not comparison with some limp latter-day airport-reading pommie imitation.
