Hates unnecessary AbStraction.

Ten years ago, I was always the one showing other programmers how to make things more generic using abstraction. These days, I find myself trying to convince programmers to re-learn how to just write straightforward code and not build unnecessary towers of abstraction. YagNi. 

Rule of thumb: never build an abstraction before you have at least two concrete examples. Many programmers abstract away when they have just one. Or none.
