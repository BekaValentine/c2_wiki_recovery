'''Not all viewers are created equal'''

There exists multiple approaches to implementing a viewer. See http://www.gadgetopia.com/2004/09/23/RSSAggregationModels.html

* It was said the LiveBookmarks, which have characteristics similar to a RssViewer, is very resource intensive.
* read somewhere that a properly implemented RssViewer should only poll its sources no more frequent than once an hour. Some of these do it much more frequently.
