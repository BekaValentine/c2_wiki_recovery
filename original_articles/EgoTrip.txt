What happens to you when you reach a milestone and wander off in order to celebrate.

Part of me is afraid I will go on an EgoTrip and never come back. Part of me thinks this has already happened. -- EdwardKiser

A life with milestones that pass by without celebration is not one that I want to (continue) living.
