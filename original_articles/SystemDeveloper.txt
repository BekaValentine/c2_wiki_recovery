There is a trend among system developers to call themselves SystemArchitect. In many cases this is a misuse of words and is done only to be able to charge more. Architecture is a team activity and a team responsibility. SystemArchitecture is not the invention and responsibility of one single guru.

A methodology like ExtremeProgramming which I'm very fond of focuses more on the job to be done that the hierarcy in the project organisation. I've never used the RationalUnifiedProcess, but from what I understand it's very focused on roles and artifacts that persons in different roles should produce. --AndersMalmros
