You can simulate:

	 :	'''<quote>'''
	 :	As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant.
	 :	'''</quote>'''

like this:

	 :	''TAB space ":" TAB'' As an element of language, a pattern is an instruction, which shows how this spatial configuration can be used, over and over again, to resolve the given system of forces, wherever the context makes it relevant.

-- Complaints :-) to JimCoplien

''TAB space : TAB'' creates a definition list for an empty term. Nifty reuse of the TextFormattingRules!
''It's not nifty, and semantically wrong. YMMV.''

Is this new? I tried the exact same thing just last week and it didn't work for me. -- BradAppleton

Ahh - I see what happened. I tried TAB ':' TAB (no space before the ':'). That extra space makes the difference
(otherwise it gets interpreted as verbatim text).

Now if only I could split the paragraph across lines so I could use italic/bold in more than one place in the paragraph.
Ward, have you upgraded Wiki to Perl5 yet? Can you make it use the "stingy" operator ('?') when matching RegularExpression-matching emboldened and italicized text? -- BradAppleton

''My only complaint is that I can never remember this rule -- I have to visit this page about every other week to remind myself how to do it.  Thanks for the ever-useful tip! -- BillTrost''

	 :	I much prefer the way that UseModWiki handles this.  Using Tabs in a web browser is silly, and typing that many space to indent seems a bit anti-productive.  In UseModWiki you just start the line with a colon ... which is a bit easier. -- EvanLanglois

''Never heard of 'stingy' before, do you mean 'non-greedy'? -- StijnSanders''
