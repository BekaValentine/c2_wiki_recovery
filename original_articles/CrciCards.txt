Or "Class-Responsibilities-Collaborators-Implementation Cards." An AntiPattern.

You know you shouldn't, but you do. You get so excited by the possibilities of your proposed class and its responsibilities, you turn the CrcCard over and start scribbling an implementation down. This reifies your thinking on the topic. This is good, as it gives you confidence that a class is implementable, like a SpikeSolution. This is bad, as it locks you into one implementation before you've fully explored the problem domain and the collaborators involved.

''Therefore,''

Hold off on turning that card over. Push the implementation in your head aside; almost all really great ideas benefit from a little fermentation. Argue about the collaborations a little more with other designers. If you absolutely can't resist, as a last resort, push the CrcCard away from you and pick up another card to scribble implementation details.
