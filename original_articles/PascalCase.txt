Words created by concatenating capitalized words. An example is this page's title, PascalCase.

Sometimes called "UpperCamelCase", or "DromedaryCase".

Distinguished from CamelCase by the restriction that the first letter must be upper case. ("camelCase" isn't PascalCase, but "PascalCase" is.)

WikiCase is more restrictive than PascalCase: WikiCase does not allow 1-letter words, but PascalCase does. ("ReadARecord" is PascalCase but not WikiCase.)
