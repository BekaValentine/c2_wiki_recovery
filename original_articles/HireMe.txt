The next obvious choice for a WikiBadge. ShamelessSelfPromotion at its shamelessest. Putting HireMe after a comment you wrote and consider particularly incisive, would perhaps be the opposite of the KillYourDarlings approach.

I wonder if anyone has ever said anything sufficiently impressive on a Wiki to warrant a hiring decision in his favor. Perhaps you wouldn't hire someone cold after reading a Wiki, but if you're interviewing someone and you recognize them from the Wiki, you have that much more respect for them.

Heck, I'd hire ANYONE from the Wiki. Just this morning I saw someone on the Subway reading ExtremeProgrammingEmbraceChange and I wanted to strike up a conversation and give him my business card. The reason I didn't is because about a year ago I was reading the LearningPython book and someone struck up a conversation with me. It was quite uncomfortable. Since then, I've accepted my inner geek, but I've realized that other people haven't yet. In that particular case, a real-life HireMe badge would've been helpful.

Of course, there's always the possibility that they won't HireMe given the quality of my posts!
