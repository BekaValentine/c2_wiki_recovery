If you're a regular reader of the AtsDiary, please sign your name here.  This diary takes a lot of effort to keep up to date, so it would be nice to know that people are reading it. :)  Thanks!

Jim, I'm really getting a kick out of reading your experiences with XP.  Keep up the good work! -- DanGreen
-----
Jim, I am getting a lot of value out of following your day-to-day accounts using XP software development.  Thanks for the effort of keeping us informed.  Cheers, Ian Stephenson

I missed the creation of the AtsDiary, and had not been following it at all. But having been lured there by this page, I expect to be a regular reader. Learning about your real world experiences is going to be very valuable. Thanks for the effort. -- JimRussell

Jim, keep this up. After the VcapsProject and the CthreeProjectTerminated, 
it's good to see the ongoing progress of another real project, rather 
than people just talking methodology. I hope it ends up showing us PassingMilestones and not a PostMortem.... -- BrianEwins
----
Keep it up.  I think this could spawn more discussion especially about PitfallsOfXpDevelopment and hopefully solutions to them.
----
I've also been following the AtsDiary. -- CurtisBartley
----
Me too. Please keep going; it's really valuable seeing your XP experiences as they happen. Pros are great but cons + solutions are better. -- JohnCrowell.
----
I'm checking this occasionally (less often than realtime) but it's very interesting to see a real project in progress.  -- David Wolff
----
I've also been following the AtsDiary. -- JohnClonts
----
Please continue!  You're somewhere around number 2 on my reading list, right after the DailyDilbert. -- MarnixKlooster
----
We are starting an XP project. Exploration phase right now. Continue your diary!  It helps a lot!
----
Very interesting story - keep going -- TracieKarsjens
----
Yes please continue.  Some concrete examples of User stories and spikes might
be useful.  MichaelChean  ''(See AtsUserStories and AtsSpikeSolution  --JimLittle)''
----
Thank you for doing this -- LarryPrice
----
Very helpful - we're considering XP and your input helps :) -- PeterLund
-----
Please keep going, and thanks.  --AlistairCockburn, 00.03.13.  p.s. email me so we can get together (1st Thurs in April, e.g.).
-----
Thanks for showing down-in-the-dirt details of applying XP on a real project -- DavidHurt

-----
Thank you for the time your putting in.  It really brings a project to life.
I hope you can keep it up. -- MiroslavNovak
-----
Jim,  thanks for keeping the diary.  It is helping.  -- AnonymousDonor

A great cook's tour of XP.  Keep showing us those pots and pans!  -- IanRae
----
I'm tracking this closely.  Please continue if you have time. -- MatthewWilbert
----
Add me to the list of interested parties enjoying the party. -- AndyJewell

Fantastic journal.  Much like the record of an expedition to the South Pole, it is interesting in its own right, and also serves as guide for others. --MichaelNygard
----
Great stuff!  -- WayneConrad
----
Your diary is very helpful to me in my attempt to understand XP.  Thank you for the effort.  -- ''JonStrayer''
----
Very Useful.  -- DanRawsthorne
----
I read it.  Very cool.  please continue.
----
Another vote for continuing to report. Very interesting.
----
Fascinating. -- MattBiddulph
----
Fabulous.  There are far too few data points for actual XP projects -- this kind of documentation of an active, ongoing project provides a lot of valuable insight.  -- BrettNeumeier
----
Wow.  ThankYou.  Just thankYou.
-----
AtsDiary just answered one of my burning questions: How do you decompose stories into engineering tasks.  Thank you!  --WayneConrad

Its terrific to see someone learning as much as you seem to be doing: my main feeling is of jealousy! Please keep posting. --SimonSmith

----

This is great!  I was wondering how the project was going and how ExtremeProgramming was working.  This certainly helps me see where I can improve in my own projects. --DaveMitchell

----
Jim, this is useful to me as I embark on an XP project of my own. Steveo (www.steveolyo.com)

Jim, more than a year has passed since you made your last entry to the AtsDiary. Nonetheless, I have found it very informative as I consider how best to make use of XP on my projects. Thank you for taking the time to share so much information with the world. -- Eric Gundrum <eric@macgroup.com>
