RE: TheyMightBeGiants - Perhaps this should be '''Everything is catching on, everything is catching on fire, everything is catching on, everything is catching on fire.'''

RE: TheoryOfRelativity - EverythingIsRelative, except the speed of massless particles in a vacuum--i.e., light--and the laws of physics.

"DocumentObjectModel: everything is a node -- except when it's an attribute."

''No, attributes are nodes too... getting attribute values directly from an element node is just a shortcut.''
----
"WhatIsXmlAnyway: everything is a hierarchy of elements -- except when they are attributes, or PIs, etc."

''Uh... attributes, PIs, comments, CDATA, etc. are still stored hierarchically; it's your fault for saying "of elements".''
----
So: WhatIsXmlAnyway: everything is a hierarchy.
----
AdaLanguage and CeePlusPlus: Everything is in there... somewhere.
