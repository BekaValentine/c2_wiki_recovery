A DramaticIdentity for welcoming visitors and new participants to WikiWiki.

''AmericanCulturalAssumption: WelcomeWagon is a civic organization/business which assists people with moves and welcomes them to new communities. (It also tries to sell 'em stuff; but it's entirely on the level.)''

The WikiWelcomeWagon, on the other hand, won't try to sell you anything.
* I rather hope The WikiWelcomeWagon participate in the marketing of MakeRoomForAllViewpoints above most other principles.

Visitors should experiment with the syntax and semantics of wiki editing at the WikiWikiSandbox.
