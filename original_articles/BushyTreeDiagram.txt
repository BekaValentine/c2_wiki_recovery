An interesting and (apparently) fairly well known diagram from the 1989 paper "The Xerox Star: A Retrospective", showing the family relationships of a number of information systems from VannevarBush'''''''s MemexVision to the Macintosh II among many others.

The whole paper is at http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2003/cmsc434-0201/Handouts/XeroxStar.pdf (PDF) and http://www.digibarn.com/friends/curbow/star/retrospect/index.html (HTML).

JohnRedant, BruceDamer and others later produced a revised version, bringing its coverage up to the year 2000 among other things:

In the source page, http://www.digibarn.com/stories/desktop-history/bushytree.html, the tree has an imagemap with links to many of the projects shown.

The diagram is quite XeroxParc-centric, but there's probably good reason for that, over and above the original paper's XeroxStar focus...

''You could probably find fault with quite a few details in the diagram(s) - no SelfLanguage or LogoLanguage? no link from SketchPad to SmalltalkLanguage? - but it seems valuable both as a general overview and as a source of pointers to many now-obscure systems. It's interesting to see how the graph links together modern-day systems as diverse as MacOsx, HyperTextMarkupLanguage, JavaLanguage/JavaPlatform and PhotoShop.''

* If SelfLanguage were added, it would link up to SmalltalkLanguage, and down to the AppleNewton. There are similar diagrams with narrower focus (only ProgrammingLanguages or only OperatingSystems).  -- ''Certainly; one of the reasons I like the Bushy Tree is that it cuts across those (and other) categories.''

Silly but half serious question: Is the tree called "bushy" because of the branching or because the root is VannevarBush? -- ''Shurely a pun? The moniker seems to be DigiBarn's coining, a quick Google doesn't turn up any other sources for it.''

Also, IIRC, the Cedar project (where Modula-2 was born) eventually begat the '''Oberon System''' project too, which also draws from Simula too.  --SamuelFalvo

In 2008 the Bushy Tree begot a new WikiaWiki, the BushyTreeWiki : http://bushytree.wikia.com/wiki/IEEE_Bushy_Tree
