The Perl module HTTP::Web''''''Test helps you to test your WebApplication. You can tell it to fetch a WebPage from an URL, and then test if the result contains the text you expect.

You define your test in a configuration file that looks like this:
 text_forbid = ( Software error)
 test_name = FrontPage
        url = "http://c2.com/cgi/wiki"
        text_require = ( Front Page )
 end_test
then you run the test with the program wt:
 wt testingwiki.wt
you get a detailed report:
 Total web tests failed: 0  succeeded: 3
 Failed  Succeeded  Test Name
    0          3    FrontPage

 Test Name: FrontPage
 URL: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki
