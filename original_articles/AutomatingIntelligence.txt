''Automating Intelligence '' ThinkingOutLoud DonaldNoyes 20010630 

This is an Idea which has already been applied. (See examples) 

It has become part of the new Science which includes other such things as Bio-Engineering. With the increased use of computing devices (more correctly termed InformationDevices) the time may come when instruction and understanding are dispensed via such devices designed by I''''''nformationEngineers to Formulate correct actions.

'''Historical Roots'''
"The quest for understanding & automating intelligence has deep roots" 
* 4th cent. B.C.: MrAristotle studied mind & thought, defined formal logic"
* 14thâ€“16th cent.: Renaissance thought built on the idea that all natural or artificial processes could be analyzed and understood
* 19th cent.: advances in science made the idea of artificial life seem plausible 
* Shelley's Frankenstein raised moral and ethical questions
* Babbage's Analytical Engine proposed programmable machine -- metaphor for brain
* 19th-20th cent.: advances in logic formalisms, e.g., Boolean algebra, predicate calculus
* 20th cent.: advent of digital computers in late 1940's made AI viable
* Turing wrote seminal paper on thinking machines (1950)"
* birth of AI occurred when MarvinMinsky & JohnMcCarthy organized the DartmouthConference in 1956 brought together researchers interested in "intelligent machines" for next 20 years, virtually all advances in AI were by attendees, MarvinMinsky (MIT), JohnMcCarthy (MIT/Stanford), Newell & Simon (Carnegie), ...
