Here are some examples of RecursiveAcronym''''''s:

	* GNU - Gnu's Not Unix
	* Pine - Pine Is Not Elm 
	* MINCE - MINCE is not complete EMACS
	* PHP - PhpLanguage (after going through some name changes)
	* TheGimp - once was 'The Gimp Image Manipulation Program' but now is 'The GNU Image Manipulation Program'. So the GnuProject doesn't only create a lot of RecursiveAcronym''''''s, some are also destroyed because of it.

Pine is actually "program for internet news & email". See http://www.washington.edu/pine/

The GnuHurd probably is the first software to be named by a pair of mutually RecursiveAcronym''''''s:

	* Hurd - HirdOfUnixReplacingDaemons
	* Hird - HurdOfInterfacesRepresentingDepth
