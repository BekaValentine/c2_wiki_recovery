A HyperText tool, notes manager, WebLog publisher and hopefully soon WikiBrowser.

But maybe you were thinking of MozillaTinderbox.

I'm using a demo of Tinderbox on my MacOsx machine and I'm finding it interesting...

It's a pretty good (but not outstanding) tool that does the following:

	* fetches RichSiteSummary feeds
	* creates outlines
	* creates TopicMaps
	* creates simple diagrams
	* manages URLs/Bookmarks/Favorites

Although there seems to be lots more it can do. I'll try to summarize as I go along. -- SeanOleary

I found it good also, but not as intuitive as I would like.---LKS
