''...I don't think it's meant to be funny in a hah hah way, maybe more like funny in a surreal way, and while I can't begin to understand what's going on and the Langston explanations usually have so little to do with what I thought was going on that it makes me feel stupid in a way I've never felt before (I can't even understand a COMIC???), if it went away I think I'd miss it. Yeah, I know it's on GreenCheese, but I like running across it in RecentChanges - like finding the funnies in the middle of a newspaper.'' -- DaveVoorhis

Try the "Poison River" story from LoveAndRockets. You can read the whole thing straight through, perceive it's about gangsters duking it out, and never realize it's about human trafficking.
