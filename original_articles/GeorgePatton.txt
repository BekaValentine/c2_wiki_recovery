Gen. George S. Patton, Jr. is one of the most famous (or infamous) American military commanders in history. Patton's Third Army lead the breakout from Normandy and charged across France in a brilliant example of ManeuverWarefare.

Lest the reader think only praise should be heaped upon this triumphant warrior, it should be remembered that Patton was also a bigot, bully, and alleged philanderer.

Those interested in the man and his history may enjoy the following books:
*'' Patton : A Genius for War'' [ISBN: 0060927623]
** Biography by Carlo D'Este that tells as true a story of the real man as he could manage. Leaves out no misdeed, but praises Patton where he is worthy.
* ''War As I Knew It'' [ISBN: 0395735297]
** Patton's memoirs of battle and leadership. While parts are at best described as historical fiction, this book presents an insight into the man that cannot be gained elsewhere.
*'' The Patton Mind : The Professional Development of an Extraordinary Leader'' [ISBN: 0895294281]
* This fascinating volume by Roger H. Nye takes a look into '''how''' Patton became one of the most successful military commanders in history. Most useful are the analogies that can be drawn between Patton's study of military history and the professional study of programmers as a key to success.
*''Patton's One-Minute Messages : Tactical Leadership Skills for Business Management'' [ISBN: 0891415467]
** A slim volume of the style of TheOneMinuteManager. The pithy "Pattonisms" inside though are worth the small asking price. Worth buying a stack of so you can give them to your co-workers and even your boss.
* ''Patton on Leadership : Strategic Lessons for Corporate Warfare'' [ISBN: 0735200912]
** Similar to Patton's One-Minute Messages, this book explores the Patton style of leadership as it relates to business and management in more depth.
