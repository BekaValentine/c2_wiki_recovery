Specifically, WardsWiki is UseNet.

At least that's the way it feels with all this OoVsRelational ThreadMess flying around...

Somebody made here the assumption that WikiWiki was, at some point, a place so much better than usenet, but it degraded to UseNet. 

''Some would argue that wiki was becomming too clubby, attracting a filtered mindset. Plus, there are non-combative ways to clean up thread mess if you don't like it. It just takes elbow grease.''

Nothing can be further from the truth. Some areas of UseNet (comp.lang.functional, comp.lang.scheme, comp.lang.ml) are still so much better than wiki in terms of substantive discussion, quality of content, technical relevance for programmers that use it as a source of inspiration, quality of contributors, etc. Wiki does have a better potential, too bad it was never fully realized.

Maybe a fair title should be Wiki Is Comp.Object .

More proof:  AOL is now banning its users from UseNet, just like how AOL is banned from here!
