A suggested phrase to take the place of "HelloWorld" in the 1,345,721 places it occurs in test phrases in beginner's programs or new languages. It will probably result in more returned responses from expected contacts from terrestrials and extra-terrestrials. With HelloWorld, everyone will assume someone else will answer, with "DoesThisWork" everyone will assume they are the only one receiving the message and will more likely than not, answer you.

The expected (provided for) response could be one of the following: yes, sure does, yep, ok, true, ubetcha, thisrocks, send me this and I'll UnitTest it, (it all belongs to us!), or "Greetings, human, I am Zarblak from the planet Gronk." ''Cherlankta, actually''
