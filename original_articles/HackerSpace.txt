A '''hackerspace''' (also makerspace) is a ''physical'' space implementing an emergent model for economic activity.  It also (importantly) serves as a ''sanctuary'' for those of technical bent.  It traditionally uses an ad-hocratic form of governance.  

The ideal hackerspace has:

* radical tools available for individuals to make things (like 3-d printers, laser cutters, etc), 
* a presentation space for people to demonstrate what they're working on (including novel projection devices), and 
* lots of brilliant minds moving in and out of it, forming a nexus of innovation.

It facilitates a nascent Gift and Barter economy and encourages new, post-Industrial livelihood.
