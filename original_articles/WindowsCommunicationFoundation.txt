'''MicrosoftWay - EnterpriseServiceBus (ESB) alternative'''

WCF together with BizTalk is a "superset" of ESB, according to Microsoft. 

ZapThink wrote in 2005 that WCF "is essentially a framework for building a whole range of different tools, including ESBs." (http://www.zapthink.com/2005/08/31/microsoft-pitches-esb-alternative/)
