Can anyone on Wiki share with me their knowledge of, or point me to a tutorial on, RationalRose scripting? I'm being required to use Rose to document some components, but havent been given a licence for reverse engineering, so would like to automate the production of the model as much as possible.

I've got some now, thanks Sunna.
