Vim [http://www.vim.org] is an open source clone of vi, the de facto standard Unix text editor.
Actually, it does lots of things that original ''vi'' doesn't;
the name stands for '''v'''i '''im'''proved. Or maybe '''vi''' i'''m'''proved.

Actually, the acronym VI stands for Vim Imitation. ;)
Or Very Impossible.

''[Comments from SlickEdit page...]''

Vim (http://www.vim.org) has natively a rather cumbersome extension language, but you can compile it with an embedded Python interpreter, a Perl interpreter, etc.. Python definitely counts as a "modern O-O language".
-- StephanHouben

I believe you can also use Ruby, if that's your sort of thing. 

''The 'native extension language' called (I think) Vim script works quite well, it's just a little ugly. You can use Python (or Perl) but for editing work there's usually no need - the editor itself has a myriad of builtin features that are very powerful.''

The developer release of Vim 6.0 has the following of the features bulleted above:

	* Virtual Edit Mode
	* Column Cut and Paste
	* Fill Selected Area (including column(s) with Char)
	* Delete Selected Area (including column(s))
	* B''''''adAss regular expression support
	* Hex editing thingy
And I've edited 200Meg files with it just fine.

''Heck, I have edited MS Word files with it. ;-)''

''Is there some trick to this? Do you run them through antiword? Because Word files appear to not be text-based...''

I'm using VIM 6.1, but it has a remarkably difficult time displaying (and colorizing) non-trivial XML files.  (7/26/2002)
I'm often forced to fall back to Notepad.  ''(Ick!!!)''
-- JeffGrigg

''Err, ah, you could just turn off the syntax awareness feature.  I mean, really, '''notepad??'''  Extreme Masochism?'' -- GarryHamilton

If you have xmllint installed, try formatting your XML markup with
  :%!xmllint -format -
Aside from nicely indenting the XML, this will restore Vim's speedy syntax coloring (which apparently depends on line length). When working with large, unformatted XML files, I generally turn off auto-highlight for XML, then turn it on selectively.

You can turn off syntax highlight with :nohl

What about ''Vigor'' instead?
''No. Vigor does not belong here, as it is based on nvi.''

from VimTextE''''''ditors (probably can be deleted here):

Vi Improved. An excellent implementation of VI, the venerable UnixOs editor that originated at CalBerkeley. It has lots of improvements and extensions over the original VI (hence the "Improved") and is available freely (FreeAsInBeer and free as in OpenSource). If you don't want to build it yourself, there is almost certainly a binary available for your particular platform (nearly every UnixOs, MicrosoftWindows, MacOsx, etc.). 

''MacOsx, at least, comes with Vim included, accessible from the command line. Just type "Vi" at the prompt in whatever shell you use.''
