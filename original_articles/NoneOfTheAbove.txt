When all choices are bad and you don't want to attempt to find the lesser of multiple evils, you can exit the issue orthogonally by choosing NoneOfTheAbove.  In some voting systems, NoneOfTheAbove is a legitimate candidate and if NoneOfTheAbove wins the vote, all previous candidates (with the exception of NoneOfTheAbove) are disqualified and the election is rerun with different candidates. NoneOfTheAbove is a form of ProtestVote.

NoneOfTheAbove is apparently an option in some elections in Nevada, USA.

NoneOfTheAbove is essentially the same as the ReOpenNominations (RON) option. This is typically an option in student elections in OxfordUniversity, and may well be in use elsewhere. In Oxford, RON is particularly useful when there is only one candidate - it is still possible to reject them.
