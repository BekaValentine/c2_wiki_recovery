Software developer, currently with IDD Information Services in Waltham, MA.  One-time computational linguistics student, now studying on AI/machine learning at Brandeis University.  

I've had the opportunity to apply several of the GOF patterns at work and in grad school projects, and in the utopian society of the future, I'll work simply out of an appreciation for the beauty of a good design.

In the meantime, I can be reached at jlammers@bigfoot.com
