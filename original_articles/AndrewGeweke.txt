I became interested in ExtremeProgramming during my tenure at Kenamea, under the tutelage of the brilliant PeterSeibel. Watching RonJeffries and BrianMarick help take another team from a traditional BigDesignUpFront methodology (that wasn't working) to a more agile one (that did) convinced me that they were on to something. Now, I'm looking around, trying to figure out better what works and what doesn't. It's an interesting challenge.
