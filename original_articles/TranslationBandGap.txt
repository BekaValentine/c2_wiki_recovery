The somewhat subjective gap between the abstraction level of the source code you write and the code that runs. Depends on a lot of factors like the richness of the standard libraries and frameworks you use. In C++ I can write some pretty abstract object-oriented and/or functional code but I can right-click-go-to-disassembly and step through the raw assembly code. The huge TranslationBandGap is what makes C++ such manly fun. Which is not to say I don't enjoy LISP and Ruby programming, which have a fairly unmanly TranslationBandGap. --AndrewQueisser
