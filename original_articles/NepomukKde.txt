NepomukKde is a component of the KayDesktopEnvironment which provides an implementation of an ontology for a semantic desktop.

See http://nepomuk.kde.org and article in Linux Magazine Issue 151 June 2013 (UK).

For more on the ontologies see http://www.semanticdesktop.org/ontologies/

This work was started as the Nepomuk project which ended in 2008. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEPOMUK_%28framework%29

This is a part of a wider aim to produce a SemanticDesktop.

Quote from http://nepomuk.kde.org:

'''Functionalities'''
 
''Nepomuk offers several 'layers' of functionality to applications. The first and most simple of those is manual tagging, rating and commenting, as used in Dolphin. This helps you to find your files faster, but is also a lot of work.''

''To make finding files containing text easier, Nepomuk offers a second functionality: indexing the text of files. It uses a technology called Strigi for this. You can find files by entering some words which you know are in there, or just (part of) their title.''

''The third layer is a very complex one, and the reason why Nepomuk was conceived as a research project of several companies and universities in the European union. This is where you will find difficult words like 'semantic desktop' and 'ontologies'. Basically, it is about context and relationships.''

I am currently experimenting with this to find out what is possible. I have installed the tools by including the KayDesktopEnvironment in my UbuntuLinux installation where the GnomeDesktopEnvironment has been my default. Some of the tools (e.g. Dolphin) run under Gnome as well. -- JohnFletcher

''And I always discover that task clogging up my ''htop'' process list, and do everything I can to kill it, to return its resources to the applications that I ''want'' to run!'' --PhlIp

I have seen some comments about it hogging the CPU while looking around. It seems to be a matter of which version according to some people. It may become a reason for updating to the latest version of UbuntuLinux, something I have been resisting as I don't want to have to revisit all the problems I have solved about my Nvidia graphics. -- JohnFletcher
