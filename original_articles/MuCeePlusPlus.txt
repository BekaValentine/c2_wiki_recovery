MuCeePlusPlus (muC++) is a product of the MuSystemProject at the UniversityOfWaterloo.

http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~usystem/uC++.html

muC++ defines a set of extensions to the CeePlusPlus language which enable object-oriented concurrency. There is a translator which converts code written using these extensions into CeePlusPlus which can then be compiled using GnuCpp.

The following article explains their design principles:
