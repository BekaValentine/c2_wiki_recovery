A ManagementIdea which I think is a ManagementPattern. Developed by DavidNorton and RobertKaplan.

You can't manage what you can't measure, so a manager should have all the necessary information in just one card (screen or page).

Information is entered into the system by workers as they work. No extra work is necessary to enter information, that would delay the information entry.

Managers can see the information in RealTime by looking at the card, the BSC (BalancedScoreCard).

Key business drivers are transformed into KPI (KeyProcessIndexes) that appear as scores in the BSC.

Alternatively, KPI is KeyPerformanceIndicator.
