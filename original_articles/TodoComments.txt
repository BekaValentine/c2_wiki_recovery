Taken from TodoCommentsConsideredHarmful.

Comments that mark something for later work, later revision or at least later reconsideration. Most common form is the one remainder of the line comment form:

   // TODO: a note for further revisiting this thing.
TODO comments should be considered a very useful technique, although like all good things on Earth, there's certainly potential for abuse.
