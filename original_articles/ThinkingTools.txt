A thinking tool is an extension of your brain and body.  Books, internet, spoken languages, pencils and paper, computers, libraries, wikis, databases (on paper cards or computers), are all ThinkingTools.

We have more access to thinking tools today than we did hundreds of years ago. Google is a great thinking tool because there is no need to drive your vehicle to the library or book shop in order to get quick information.
