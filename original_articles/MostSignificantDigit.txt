The y2k problem showed us that we should not ignore the century digits. 
In fact the most significant digits in the years are the first ones, as in 1914 and 2014.
I think the crusades were around 1014.  

Even after the y2k boundary, folks continue to leave off the first two MostSignificantDigit''''''s.

Have we learned nothing?  Shall we repeat the errors of the past?
