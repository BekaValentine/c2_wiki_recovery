ZopeTestCase is a more recent product than the SourceForge ZUnit.

	 :	"ZopeTestCase is an attempt to make writing unit and regression tests in Zope a more rewarding experience. The package deals with all the plumbing required, and leaves the coder with writing the tests - and the tests only. It is built on PythonUnit and the Testing package coming with Zope."
