A very interesting WikiName to say the least.

OScript is a simple language based on the syntax of JavaScript (EcmaScript) and JavaLanguage.  

In OoVvMm, someone pointed to http://www.lri.fr/~bosilca/OVM/introduction.php3 ''(BrokenLink 2004-05-31)'' and i was going to be silly and redo the page, but changed with my own info (which is equally sparse ;), but instead i shall just post a mailing list link and let the wiki do its duty.

Of course, being that this is a discussion forum itself, I dont expect anyone to actually subscribe.

Simplest HelloWorld in OScript:

 Main : class {
   run : function {
      System.out.println ("Hello, OScript!!)
   }
 }

''Is that a typo, or is the string syntax actually that weird?''
