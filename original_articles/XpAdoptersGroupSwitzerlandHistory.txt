Maybe do some CodeKatas from PragDave (aka DavidThomas)...??
See http://www.pragprog.com/pragdave/Practices/Kata for more information.

We were there - we did not code but have a beer or two. We talked about test coverage, SoftNet, and the number of attendees. Some would find it more interesting, if more (or at least interesting;) people would join, I found it good enough like this. --DanielSchweizer

Canoo Engineering AG, Kirschgartenstr. 7, Basel, see http://www.canoo.com/contact/findus.html

 Participants: DierkKoenig, UrsKeller, EtienneStuder, JiriLundak, GrahamCunningham, AndreasReiss, DanielSchweizer

 Topics: 
	* '''Date/Time'''
	 :	We added the above calendar sheet for finding a good date where most of the members are able to attend. Please increase the counter on days where you could attend and add your name to the "already increased" list. The date with the highest counter will be chosen at march 1st.
	* '''TDD'''
	 :	DierkKoenig points the group to the new yahoo group about TestDrivenDevelopment. 
	* '''XpAtUdNeueMedien'''
	 :	Urs and Jiri report about their experiences introducing XP at UdNeueMedien.
	* '''CodeCoop'''
	 :	Graham mentioned that VCS system and promised to set a pointer, which he did meanwhile.
	* '''XpPlanItPlus'''
	 :	Graham and Andreas told about their current effort to build a next generation of XpPlanIt that works offline and with DragAndDrop. Technology base would be GrooveTechnology. They gave a short demo and WOW! that looks really sexy.
	* '''Daedalos'''
	 :	Daniel reported on the working style of DaedalosInternational.
	* '''Customer connection'''
	 :	Etienne reports on the customer involvement style in his current project.
	* '''XP at CanooDotCom'''
	 :	DierkKoenig shows how CruiseControl works at CanooDotCom. Example for this is CanooWebTest where there is online access to the build info at http://webtest.canoo.com. We went through a microiteration to see it working. Building is done with ANT, unit testing is done with ANT-JUnit integration, functional testing is done by applying CanooWebTest to itself (it is a functional testing tool) and ANT Integration, reporting uses specialized XSL, planning is done with XpPlanIt (public access).
	* '''Wine'''
	 :	Surprisingly, no reports about headaches so far...

The Friday 20.07.01 gathering was held joyfully at the ''Reithalle'' in Zurich.

The event was attended by: JeromeMueller, HaskoHeinecke, PeterGassmann, MarcelRueedi, DierkKoenig, StephanMaier and MartinJaekle. 

Here's the URL of the paper I'v mentioned http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/files/One%20Team.doc
-- MarcelRueedi

Besides getting to know each other we discussed several topics. One was the role of architecture, or rather infrastructure in XP. I've tried to summarize in InfrastructureInXp --HaskoHeinecke

Another question was how to give more people the chance to do Xp. We considered a one week bootcamp either free (for students) or as an commercial event. -- DierkKoenig

----

There was an event at the java user group switzerland (21.6.) dealing with VisualAgeJava Micro Edition and Xp Team support with the concept of "TeamStreams". See http://www.jugs.ch/html/events/2001/xpteamsupport.html

Speakers were KaiUweMaetzel and ErichGamma (demo assistant) from ObjectTechnologyInternational.

----

The initial "come together" was Friday, 22.6.01 19:00 at FischerstubeBasel

The event was attended by: JosephPelrine, JeromeMueller, DanielFlueck, AndreasKapp und DierkKoenig. 

The rather low attendance made it possible to have a lively discussion about our understanding of XP and our experience with it. The Ueli beer contributed to this end. It seems to be fully XP compliant: with a small initial investment we could "release" it early (right, Joseph?). As we were on-site customers we felt free to give this rapid feedback.

We enjoyed this informal group and felt no need for a formal "organization". But we did not exclude this as an option when the future "crouds" arrive.

	 :	Speaking for myself only, I must say that the group "refilled" my motivation and made me feel not being so much a geek. I missed the people that were not able to join up and I wished that some more would be so "agile" to make the train ride to basle. -- DierkKoenig
