Kaliv is very XP. Our most important tools is a screwdriver (see LordOfTheFlies). We work in Smalltalk, of course. -- JosephPelrine

I am working now as an external nearly one year for the Bayerische Landesbank on the KalivProject and BoraProject. KentBeck is history, sometimes people tell about. MichaelaHahm is now project leader. We are in the IntegrationTests and will give out the next version at the middle of September. End of the project is end of the year 2000.

We write some TestCase''''''s, but not extreme and not at the beginning of the coding. We don't do PairProgramming. StoryCard's are used in this and other projects. This is not a XpProject anymore. It is difficult to start XP on a big company, which such a heterogenous IT scene.
