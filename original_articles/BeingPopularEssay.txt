
''Being Popular'', an essay by PaulGraham on what is needed to make a new programming language "popular"; especially one not supported by some large corporation's marketing budget.  In many ways, a sequel to the famous WorseIsBetter paper.

In some ways, also a defense of ArcLanguage (against those who claim that Arc is an unnecessary deviation from CommonLisp).
