VentureCapitalist 1: Wally, we're venture capitalists.  We want to invest in your web-based business.

Wally: I don't own a web-based business.  I'm just an engineer with a cool ponytail.

VentureCapitalist 1: That's good enough for us.

VentureCapitalist 2: We like to get in early.

''Later...''

VentureCapitalist 1: Despite your cool ponytail, you seem to have squandered our investment.  You'll get no more funding unless you mutter empty Internet words that make us swoon!

Wally: E-commerce.

VentureCapitalist''''''s: *gurgle*
