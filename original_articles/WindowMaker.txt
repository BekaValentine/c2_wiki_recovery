An X11 WindowManager that copies the look and feel of a NeXt machine.  Most commonly used on Linux machines, but I've also seen in on SunWorkstations, and am told that it works on SgiWorkstations.  It also integrates well with the Gnome desktop.  

WindowMaker should work on any Unix-based system with X11.

Key features of WindowMaker include:

	* Stable:  It rarely, if ever, crashes.  I've had X11 WindowMaker sessions lasting months.  Even if the windowmanager itself crashes, it can often execute a restart without losing your X11 session or state.

	* Fast:  Basic ops are quick, response is fluid.  There's little if any waiting for basic window and menu operations, even on a heavily taxed or older system.  I'm currently running WindowMaker on systems down to a P-133 with 48 MiB RAM.

	* Clean:  The basic configuration is simple to the point of being spartan, but attractive, and highly functional.  While not offering the themeability of some windowmanagers (say, Enlightenment or SawFish), it's possible to change aspects of the environment.  The clip and dock offer much of the functionality of a start bar in GNOME or KDE without the real-estate costs.

	* Configurable:  Most of the functionality ""I"" like is under the hood.  WPrefs (and wmakerconf) are clean, intuitive configuration utilities.  A few clicks of the mouse change focus policy, menu configuration is drag'n'drop, hotkeys can be bound to virtually anything from command launchers to window manipulation (maximize vertically rocks).	Though hard to present visually, this is really a key strength of WindowMaker.

	* Plays well with others.  Though a satisfactory desktop on its own, WindowMaker can be used with either GNOME or KDE.

	* By far the best WM to use with a non-*nix X-server e.g. a WindowsXwindowsServer thanks to its stability
	* support for utf-8 and anti-aliased fonts
