Core features:
	* all features from WakkaWiki, including installer & upgrader (because it is really a fork from it)

	* page watching & email notification on changes/comments (simple diff included in email)
	* completely multilingual (RU,EN,ES,DA,DE,FR,NL,IT,PL,ET,PT,BG included in R5.4. Creating new language scheme seems to be very easy -- we have got most schemes from Wacko users)
	* enhanced WhatYouThinkIsWhatYouGet editing -- table markup, OpenWiki-compatible markup
	* Links can be CamelCase or FreeLinks
	* powerful diff between revisions
	* several levels of caching (backlinks, pages) bring significant performance gain compared to Wakka
