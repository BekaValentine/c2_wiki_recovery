From the Microsoft term describing automatic detection and configuration of hardware devices (and subsequent automatic loading of device drivers) to extend system capabilities.

To be successful, the programming environment itself has to be widely available to produce a population of candidates. The System/38 and later AS/400 RPG markets were particularly strong in this regard - one application language, one visual interface (character mode GreenScreen and fixed font printing), and one database. VisualBasic with MicrosoftAccess and/or SqlServer is another example.
