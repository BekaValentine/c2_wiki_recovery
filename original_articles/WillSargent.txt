I'm JustaSoftwareEngineer. I used to work for ArtTechnologyGroup.  

I have a web site at http://tersesystems.com, where I keep useful bits of code.

Interests: Category''''''Java, Category''''''Wiki.

I am not related to Echo and the Bunnymen Will Sargent. I am, however, the direct line descendant of Sargent's Meat Pies, a company well known in Australia.

''In which state? I remember Big Ben Pies, and especially their truly corny radio spots of "I feel like a Big Ben Pie. Really, you don't look like one."... I say that to people in Sydney and they give me a blank look - so disappointing.''

I think it was originally a restaurant in Narrabeen.
