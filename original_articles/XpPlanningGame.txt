In our first meeting I tried to cover a little bit about everything.
In this meeting I will focus on planning and managing a project using XP.

What is different in XP? Everything. XP is about direct communication, rapid feedback and aligning roles.

This is the area that makes the largest demands on the Customer. 
I will talk about what a Customer must do in addition to what the Developers must do to succeed at XP.

In the first meeting I presented the "bill of rights", this will be a look at the techniques used to achieve those "rights".

I hope that you will bring lots of questions to this session. I plan to make these as interactive as you want.

If you missed the first session, try to read some of the "to learn more" links at my site:http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?IisXpLunchAndLearns

You need to Know, so plan to attend.

This L&L is brought to you by the Java CoE.

''This is the second in in a sequence of 1 hour lunch and learns that I am presenting at my company. I am working to inject XP into the minds of the the developers and managers, so that we can support the new XP based project we have and so that people will want to turn future projects into XP projects. Any and all comments are welcome.''
