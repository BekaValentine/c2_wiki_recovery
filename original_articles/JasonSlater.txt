I started out dabbling on the ZX-81 then wrote some games for the Vic-20 and ZX-Spectrum which even got me my fifteen minutes of TV fame back when I was 14.

In my working life I have developed an information system in C, an ERP in Cobol, a global intranet platform, oh and a computer game for a well known tyre company.

I am currently reading all about the history of computing, communications and the Internet - which is quite interesting.
