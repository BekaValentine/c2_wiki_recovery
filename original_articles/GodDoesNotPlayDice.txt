Einstein's famous epigram is mostly misunderstood, like most epigrams. (For instance, Solomon's baby... but let's not go there.)

Einstein's point was that "probability" is the wrong word to apply to what's going on in QuantumMechanics. The great man would have been unsurprised by the EPR experimental outcomes, and never expressed a preference for local hidden variable interpretations. So anyone who tells you Einstein was wrong in this particular case is full of it.

No-one knows exactly where Einstein was going with the comment, but probably in the direction of some kind of larger-dimensional manifold basis for QM. As to whether that's the right direction to go or not, no-one knows. These days, the most popular theories - Cramer's TransactionalInterpretation and Everett's ManyWorlds - don't have God playing dice either.

''What do you mean by "probability"? The word has two meanings, the popular one of a choice function, and the mathematical one of a measure. The former is random, the latter is deterministic. The latter is exactly what QM is.''

Lots of philosophical assumptions in what you write.
