Pages which describe and define that a process in, or development of, an object can be changed, evolving in an orderly manner so as to lead to the object surviving in a present environment. This happens by the changing of structure and methods to the end that whether in hostile or friendly environments, success and survival of the object can and do occur.

This category contains pages and ideas which include I''''''ntelligentDesign, where the object is an artifact upon which the human mind and human hand act effecting change over time. This design includes how man uses methods, proposes theories, accumulates and disseminates information, as well as how these are changed to eliminate dissonance and contradiction. An interesting web page which presents an evolutionary multimedia glimpse on what is meant is illustrated by the example here linked about how a page is introduced, how it changes, acts of vandalism countered, and the demonstration of How WikiWorks. It uses a WikiPedia page, but the demonstrated effects could be extrapolated to any wiki with a relatively large user base. -- DonaldNoyes
