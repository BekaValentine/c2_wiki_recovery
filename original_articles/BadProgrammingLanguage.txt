
A programming language that really, really sucks.  The sort of languages which makes the simplest of tasks (HelloWorld, etc.) horrendously complicated.  The sort of language that that turns programmers into heroes; as doing '''anything''' requires heroic efforts.  The sort of language that fortunately, is seldom seen in the wild these days (and is usually specific to a particular site; one which has been using it for years and sees no reason to change).

No, we're not talking C/C++/C#/Java, no matter how popular bashing these may be 'round these parts.  We're not talking joke languages like InterCal; only RealProgrammingLanguage''''''s need apply.  No we're not talking CobolLanguage; we're talking languages that are WorseThanCobol.  '''Far''' worse.
