At the end of a SixThinkingHats discussion, it is important to identify what conclusions, if any, have been reached, and to evaluate the quality of the thinking that has occurred, and such things as whether the particular sequence of hats was adequate. Because this is BlueHat thinking, most SixThinkingHats discussions end with a BlueHat specifically for this purpose.

(You can also stick a BlueHat in the middle if you find that things are going horribly wrong...)
