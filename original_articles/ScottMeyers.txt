"Given that I donâ€™t really use C++, nor do I help specify it, you might wonder what I do do. Fundamentally, I study C++ and its application. [...] I like to think of myself as an outside observer, not too deeply steeped in the day-to-day travails of programmers and not too keenly focused on the minutiae of standardization, yet familiar with both." - from Part 1 of his ''A Pause to Reflect'' series. Parts 1 and 4 together give a good sense of his place in the C++ world. (And the series is a good read anyway.)
