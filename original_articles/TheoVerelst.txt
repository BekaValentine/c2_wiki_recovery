Dutch [http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?NetherlandsEurope] by birth, not conviction (I'd have to be pretty damn fascist, nowadays).

Electrical Engineer from Delft University.
Long term musician, range of popular music, special interest for Modern Jazz/Fusion, playing keyboard/synthesizer, years of band playing and performing experience (though little lately). I also play guitar, though a bit shorter and not by far as often as I played keys, also electical. In fact I know my way on the drums, too, but that's more incidental, except when counting digital ones. Recording and mixing are long existing experience areas for me.

I unregularly but over some time maintain a diary, which however often is more like a cross between essay, important thoughts, describing major trends I find important and actual personal diary stuff I fing important and/or suitable for a non-blog like page with pictures, sounds and video.

Programmer (of course) in assembly, C, C++ (not too much), Objectice-C, Java (also not too much)/javascript, Tcl (pretty much), OpenGL (and others), unix shells, recently DSP.

I'm researching into building a synthesizer, in fact recently I presented a little talk (at http://www.fosdem.org [http://82.168.209.239/fosdem]) where I demo-d a functional program prototype of my string simulator ([http://82.168.209.239/Articles/pms.html]), which is cutting edge enough synthesis technique requiring a lot of computer power, with good results, and theoretically interesting.

I like art (I drew models and abstract for some years as hobby), and photograph and make video, for which I had decent courses to begin with...

I guess importantly, I was quite an electronician, both theoretically founded and practically capable, already when I was at highschool, over 20 years ago. Recently, I've been into high Q audio systems, completely self made (and designed) speakers, amplifiers, and a high quality USB AD/DA converter.

I'm working on making a DSP system run sound synthesis software: ProgrammingDsp

On the Philosophy/Religion plane, I thought I'd make a warning/refutation page on the popular delusion of the NewAge movement.

I'll be speaking in the Tcl/Tk Developers Room at FosDem conference in Brussels end of february 2005.
