If you're working for a manager who uses MicrosoftProject to schedule tasks, you may need a MicrosoftProjectViewer to open the project plan and view it. Microsoft does not make a view-only product for Project. MS (apparently) thinks that all team members should have access to a full version of Project or that the peons don't need to see the schedule.

Here are some I've found. I don't have any experience with any of them.

* Afinion Project Viewer (http://www.afinion.com/) Note: Freeware version, Light Version $18. More than 35k installations. Full Java Software. No installation necessary. Platforms: Win,Linux, Max, Solaris, Unix. $46 or less per user. Reads also from databases and shows plans from SAP PS, too. Popular in big companies like Daimler Chrysler.
* Steelray Project Viewer (http://www.steelray.com/steelray_project_viewer_overview.php) $34.95 or less per user. Market leader, very solid. Excellent for printing and exporting, and runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. Adds cool navigation features.
* MOOS Project Viewer (http://www.moosprojectviewer.com/) $25 per user, working on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux. 
* Seavus Project Viewer 8.5 (http://www.seavusprojectviewer.com) $39 or less per user. 
* Project Reader (http://www.projectreader.com) 32 Euro.
* Project Viewer Central (http://www.projectviewercentral.com/) $30 US per user for standalone; webserver version for large orgs.
* Projette (http://www.highlydeveloped.net/home.aspx) Free for viewing, $10 to add printing. Requires .NET.

''Or, you can print the thing. Helps to have a C- or D- sized plotter available.''
* Why do you think they invented scotch tape? :-) ''Wasn't that before plotters were available''

From a visitor: I'm trying out Projette (to keep the cost down)... so far, so good. I have Windows 2000 with .Net.
Thanks for posting this list!

More than just a viewer, but a free MSProj-compatible project scheduling tool: OpenProj (http://www.projity.com).

I already use Seavus Project Viewer 3.5. and i recommend it to all Project Managers who want to save money and still have their job done.
