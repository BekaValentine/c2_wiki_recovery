Mathematician. Interested in mathematical physics, representation theoretic approaches.
Studying the equivalence (Kazhdan-Lusztig) between Rep(~g) and Rep(Uqg), and dynamical Weyl operators (Etingof-Tarasov-Varchenko).
Would like to know more about number theory - put on hold.
Often use the en:wikipedia and zh:wikipedia.
Found this place via wikimedia, somehow.
