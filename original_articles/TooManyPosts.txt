Gee whiz!  Why does the second "delete" always give me this message, these days:
 The WikiWiki Server Can not Process Your Request
 
     Too many posts from 172.56.17.131. Your changes not saved..
 
 This information has been logged.
 We are sorry for any inconvenience.
It's tedious to confirm the deletes of SgWa with such restrictions!

Certainly I've been "off and on" and "out of touch" a lot recently.  I'm a busy guy.  But have things changed that much around here?

I can't seem to do more than one edit -- without giving it a delay of some unknown number of hours.   :-(

I guess it doesn't like my IP address.
It's my TMobile phone.

I hate to use proxy servers to get around the issue.  :-(
