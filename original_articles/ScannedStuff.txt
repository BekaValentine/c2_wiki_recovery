''Sometimes my Digital Information needs may include written, sketched, typewritten or printed material so I ScanItAndMakeItReachable - '' DoingStuff.DonaldNoyes.20141113
----
I use a combination of scanners: An Ads-2000 for my sheet-fed documents, a flat-bed for stiff, thick or other artifacts which cannot be sheet-fed, and a DigitalCamera for 3d or very large artifacts.

The images obtained might then be further processed via OCR and other methods to make the text contained within the artifacts reachable. 

For some occasions the artifact image might have a constructed linking document pointing to it.
