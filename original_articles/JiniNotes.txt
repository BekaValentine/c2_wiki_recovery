Keywords to identify jini. Jini uses ''well-known'' interfaces to provide ''plumbing'' for jini services for ''spontaneous networking'' between devices and applications.

Jini services use a discovery protocol to form into ''communities''. Jini communities are ''fault-tolerant'' and ''self-healing''.

''original author's opinion'': Jini will emerge to dominate the PeerToPeer future internet.

I wish it would. I've had JiniTechnology on my list of Neat Things for several years now. I even proposed it as a solution to a project that never took off, but wanted self-healing, fault tolerant distributed services. But it's taking a little too long to make the move from "good idea" to "practical application". If I could find a Jini-enabled stereo, or even toaster, I'd be willing to buy it just for the Hack''''''Value. -- CharlesMiller
