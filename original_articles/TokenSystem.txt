The TokenSystem is a very light RolePlaying''''''System. 

It is based on the idea that a RolePlaying session is something like a narrative. 

The structure of RolePlaying narratives tend to be pretty similar. The protagonists get involved in some mystery or action, they make a few gains, some some defeats, encounter UltimateEvil and defeat it. It's a series of ups and downs through which our heroes learn from their mistakes and progress to their eventual triumph.

This RolePlaying''''''System is made up of four elements:
*TokenSystemCharacters: how to create characters
*TokenSystemTokens: what tokens are and how to use them
*TokenSystemPlay: how to play the TokenSystem
*TokenSystemExperience: how characters improve
