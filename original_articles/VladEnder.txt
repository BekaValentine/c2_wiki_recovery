Living in Wellington, New Zealand, although originally from Europe.

I spend most of my company time programming in Visio/Word/PowerPoint. I would love to become JustaProgrammer again, but unfortunately wherever I turn I end criticizing the current state of affairs until people get sick of it and promote me. Fortunately, I can still get my hands dirty working on my own small projects, which currently include a code inspection/analysis tool (looking for smelling code?) for Java.

My current employer is http://www.solnet.co.nz and you can try vlad.ender@myemployer if you think you have something to tell me.
