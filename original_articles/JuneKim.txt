''In which case, June, we'd love to have you take a look at WhyClublet, without wishing to poach you from Wiki. See the end of FreeThinker and OpennessOfGod here to see the two mentions of Whitehead and process thinking that I know of on Wiki (cos I wrote them). Slightly related also is the stuff on RogerPenrose and his collaborator StuartHameroff, both of whom look to Whitehead to some degree, especially the latter. -- RichardDrake''

Thank you for your directions. I'm on them. It seems to me that [those] places are rather religious (or unreligious in a religious way) than philosophical, and I'm not really knowledgeable of the heavenly side - I'm too down-to-earth to be religious, but just enough to remain philosophical. As far as the Whitehead is concerned, I'm more interested in the cosmology, wherein God is just a part of it. My favourites of Whitehead are ''Process and Reality'', ''The Adventure of Ideas'', and ''The Function of Reason'', though I couldn't understand them fully.

He wrote an article about WikiWiki in Micro-Software Magazine, one of the bestselling computer magazines in Korea. The article introduces Wiki concept and its implication in the internet age. It goes further toward its usage as a knowledge management tool and is compared with Nonaka Ikujiro's organizational knowledge evolution model.

June, I am very much interested to read your article. Do you have an English translation available? -- HelmutLeitner

I am very interested too! WikiConcept will have great effects on the InternetSpirit. OpenKnowledgeManagement for everyone. Yup! :) -- FlorianKonnertz, 0929

I'm with a school group at the University of Michigan's School of Information that has taken "Wikis" as our topic for a project in Computer Supported Cooperative Work. I'd very much like to read your article - or, hear other pointers you might have from the experience of writing it. Thanks - TomAllison 

I got your email Tom. Thank you for your interest. Unfortunately, I'm leaving home tomorrow morning for Japan to attend Conference on Creating, Connecting and Collaborating through Computing. When I come back on Feb 2, I'll drop you a line. -- JuneKim
