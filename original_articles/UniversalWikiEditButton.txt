Coming out of RecentChangesCamp Montreal (RoCoCo) in May 2007 there was a sense that there is an opportunity to "brand" the edit button on wikis in the same way that the little orange radio waves icon is used to indicate a feed.  This diffuse impulse is trying to coalesce here: http://www.aboutus.org/UniversalWikiEditButton

Thoughts?

Thank you WardCunningham, that you "just did it". Your edit button is clearly recognizable and it would be great to use it universally.
I am going to backlink to this page from the Aboutus site. You invented wiki and '''you said YES''' to a Universal Wiki Edit Button.
All active people here, who want to contribute to this (seemingly tiny) step into strengthening the global wiki community are invited to help convince those wiki players who are currently blocking the process with a '''Not Yet'''.
Please help. -- FridemarPache

To add the URL for editing to your HTML page: Make a LINK tag with rel="alternate" and type="application/wiki"

The Universal Edit Button (UEB) is a green pencil icon http://c2.com/wiki.png in the URL bar that indicates a web page is editable. It is similar to the orange "broadcast" RSS icon http://universaleditbutton.org/images/a/a7/ExampleRSS.png that indicates there is an RSS feed available.

To see the UEB in your browser, you will need to download a Firefox extension. In time, we hope that browsers will support the Universal Edit Button directly, as they have done for RSS feeds.

The UEB was launched June 19, 2008.

I am installing FireFox version 4.0 and it has advised me that the Wiki edit button 1.1 is not compatible.  The little green button has indeed disappeared.  I hope this will be fixed soon somehow. This is now recognized as an issue on the following site:
