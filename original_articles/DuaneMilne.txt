Duane has a B.Sc. (Hons)  ''(with first class honours)'' in Computer Science, which he earned at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

In his spare time he dabbles with the software on his GnuLinux machines - he is particularly passionate about WikiClones and is considering writing a PersonalInformationSystem using something similar to Wiki.

Duami Consulting Limited (http://web.archive.org/web/20030621004121/http://duami.com/) was a company he founded near the end of 2002; Duane has moved to the USA so this company was closed.
