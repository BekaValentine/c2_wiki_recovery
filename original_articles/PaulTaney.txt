Paul Taney is an anagram for ''Play a Tune''.


    On the roller coaster ride
    That my emotions have to take me on
    I heard a newborn baby cry
    Through the night.

    I heard a perfect echo die
    Into an anonymous wall
    of digital sound
    Somewhere deep inside
    Of my soul.

    Still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
    Boundless adventure of their subsequent lives
    Strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities
    A thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy 
    A Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. 

    And when these things unite in a man of greatly 
    Superior natural force, with a globular brain and 
    A ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and 
    Seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest Waters
    And beneath constellations never seen here at the north...
 
    Been led to think untraditionally and independently
    Receiving all nature"s sweet or savage impressions 
    Fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding beast/breast
    And thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental 
    Advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language...
-- Herman Melville, _Moby Dick_

    Did I see you down in a young girls town
    with your mother in so much pain?
    I was almost there at the top of the stairs
    with her screamin in the rain.

    Did she wake you up just to tell you that?
    Dream up, dream up, let me fill your cup 
    with the promise of a man.

    Well, I see you give more than I can take.
    Well, I only harvest some.
    As the days fly past
    will we lose our grasp
    or fuse it in the sun?
