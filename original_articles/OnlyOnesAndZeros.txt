Pejorative term applied to software implying that it is easy to change because
it is not physical.

''The more choices there are, the harder it is to choose.  There are a ''lot'' of choices of ones and zeros.''

Here, write a book on this subject.  Have it done in a week.

''Sorry, it may take longer than that.''

Variation:  book=program, subject=problem, week=month (sometimes), words=software.

I remember a Dave Berg (of MAD fame) cartoon. The man asks for a pack of cigarettes and the clerk behind the counter fires off a litany of choices: king or 100s, menthol or regular, hard pack or soft, filter tip or plain? The man gives up and goes for a pack of gum instead.
