LuaJava is a scripting tool for Java. The goal of this tool is to allow scripts written in Lua to manipulate components developed in Java. LuaJava allows Java components to be accessed from Lua using the same syntax that is used for accessing Lua`s native objects, without any need for declarations or any kind of preprocessing.

LuaJava also allows Java to implement an interface using Lua. This way any interface can be implemented in Lua and sent as parameter to any function, and when called, the equivalent function will be called in Lua, and it's result sent back to Java.
