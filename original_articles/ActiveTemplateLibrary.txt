ActiveTemplateLibrary (ATL) is a MicrosoftCorporation CeePlusPlus-based framework. 

It was originally designed for developers of ComComponent''''''s (see ActivexTechnology). ActiveX controls had to be small enough to download quickly over a dial-up connection, so that they could be easily embedded in a web page.  The alternative, MicrosoftFoundationClasses (MFC), produced much larger executables when linked statically, and required a several-megabyte set of runtime libraries when linked dynamically.  In contrast, ATL-based ActiveX controls were typically much smaller--ATL classes use UpsideDownInheritance to allow derivation and polymorphism without vtables, and can often be developed without even linking against the C++ runtime libraries. However, ATL gives the developer a very restricted subset of the features provided by MFC.

Later, the WindowsTemplateLibrary was based on ATL.  WTL attempts to extend ATL to more MFC-like features, without giving up the small footprint and inheritance model of ATL.
