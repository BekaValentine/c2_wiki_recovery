IbmEnterpriseComputing is concerned with software technology, products and methodology suitable for Enterprise computing, with a BigBlue perspective from IbmCorporation.

Although in the PastTwentyYears we have seen the change of fortunes of this once largest supplier of Enterprise Computing solutions company to one that is regarded as "dinosaur", the company appears to have consolidated its technology position. It exhibits leadership in various standards organizations, very much aligned with SunJAVAconsortium and has substantial interests in the success of JtwoeeEnterpriseComputing.

''The bulk of present day (2004) enterprise solutions still run on BigBlue infrastructure and uses CobolLanguage, despite all the headlines on DotNet and Java.''
