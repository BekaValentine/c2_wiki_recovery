DumpsterDiving can probably be best described as reclaiming usable but discarded resources, such as furniture, clothing and computer parts or accessories. Some people do it for the free stuff, some because it's better for the environment, and others to protest consumerism.

However, taking discarded materials is theft in some jurisdictions.

''I am mostly in it for the free stuff.''

Consumerism is a gross violation of OnceAndOnceOnly to which DumpsterDiving can be seen as a refactoring of sorts.  

Seems like the opposite: Isn't using something OnceAndOnceOnly and then throwing it away the ultimate in consumerism? :-)

''Maybe, maybe not. Depends if you mean '''use''' OnceAndOnceOnly or '''manufacture''' OnceAndOnceOnly.''

Perhaps the alternative to throwing away stuff that you don't need anymore, or needs minor repair, would be to set up some sort of community Dumpster specifically designed for diving. 

I recently had to put a repairable washing machine on the curb for pick-up by the city only to see it crushed beyond recognition. Charities used to repair such things, but they only want working, immediatlely saleable items. It seems like a tragedy that a person with a knack of repairing things can't dumpster dive for such things. Any other thoughts on solutions?

A "Its Free Flea Market", or a section of a Flea Market where stuff can be placed or advertised as available for free.

A newspaper public-service where one might place an ad about free articles available for pickup at a specified drop off site. Perhaps on a Saturday or Sunday in a Public Zone, with items not picked up at the end of the day being Dumpstered.

DumpsterDiving also refers to digging in dumpsters for proprietary information which was not securely disposed of (think of phreakers and Ma Bell, etc).  Probably less common now than it was in the eighties... Some have said news reporters have resorted to such DumpsterSnooping

''As do the police.  In the UnitedStates, the courts have long held that if you put your trash out on the curb for collection, it becomes public domain at that point and may legally be searched by anyone without a warrant.  (If you keep your trash can in your garage, the cops cannot come rifle through it, at least not without a warrant).''

''Here in PortlandOregon, there was a case which depended on DumpsterDiving by the police, the defense held the search was illegal, and they were told no by the courts.  Perp goes to jail.  So one of the local alternative newsweeklies sends a reporter to the mayor's house, to go through ''her'' trash--and reports on what was found.  Mayor was not amused; though couldn't do anything about it.''
