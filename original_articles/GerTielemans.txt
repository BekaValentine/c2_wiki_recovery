Since 1982 active on the edge of computers and education in The Netherlands.

His current project is integrating the open source vle MOODLE in the educational system for 9 public schools in Enschede(NL). This Moodle has eWiki (Erfurt) clever integrated in the vle and allows wiki-format editing in other edit boxes.
We tune Moodle for our educational system. We run this system on https://studiewijzerplus.nl.

His "Former Fun project" was TeLeTOP (1997-2000)
This was a flexible, democratic and a WIKI-easy tool for University WWW courses. 
(NOT a WIKI, just a humble layer on top of a Lotus Domino Server.)
All our professors (University Twente / NL) can use it with a smile.

I used Swiki successful with secondary school students to create their own travel guide for a trip to Rome (or Loddon) 
I am looking for teachers using WIki, SWiki & Squeak in educational settings. (Soc. Constr. students projects?)
