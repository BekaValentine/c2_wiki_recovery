''An idea I have been toying around with is to mount a filesystem which interprets files and provides this structured content as sub folders. The simplest case of displaying archives (ZIPs) as their content is often already simulated by file browsers.''
But my idea is to also:
* expand documents into folders for chapters, pages, paragraphs 
* possibly providing sym-links for cross refs
* a folder containing all embedded images
** provide sub folders for old versions (or use git for this)
*** I seem to remember that there is at least one CMS which does something like this.
** expand spreadsheets into sheets (and rows and colums)
** expand code artifacts into folders for classes and methods
This way you can use your normal tools (file explorers, CLI, backup, RCS) on this structure
This would avoid reimplementing in each application
* versioning
* navigation
* merging
* backup
* copy/paste, structured modification

'''Alternative to traditional uses of files systems'''
* I think this is a plausable approach to an alternate way of using files in a computer or from the internet
