Unlike a TextEditor, in which the user navigates and edits in terms of plain text, a LanguageAwareEditor performs navigation and editing in terms of the programming language being edited.  This includes both ReFactoring and transformations that change, rather than preserve, behaviour.

Example editing actions:
* Wrap expression in call to function ''f'' (where ''f'' is found by AutoCompletion)
* Unwrap an expression, removing one or more function-calls from around the expression
* Convert expression to function parameter.

A LanguageAwareEditor is an essential component of modern IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment''''s
