'''Problem:'''

Frequent readers to the Wiki often bookmark RecentChanges. On occasion, the number of pages changed quickly increases. This causes an increase in the size of RecentChanges. Some editors become uncomfortable with the RateOfChange and take active measures to slow it down. This may be an AntiPattern.

Interestingly, no one seems to mind how often a single page is edited. In fact, actively-edited pages are where much good content is created. Page growth is generally self-regulating: it either splits into new pages, or it devolves into a spaghetti-like ThreadMode or becomes TooBigToEdit.

'''Discussion:'''

Many WikiGnome''''''s and WikiCitizen''''''s pride themselves by monitoring RecentPages. This is expected, since it's an effective way to keep up to date, participate in active threads, and preserve content from vandals. 

The problem comes when editors have different comfort levels in the RateOfChange. 

'''Example:'''

During the 2002 WikiSpringCleaning, some editors became concerned with the rate of page deletions. They perceived that significant changes were being made and content was being lost. The perception caused them to attempt to dissuade other editors from proceeding.

'''Potential Solution:''' 

Try: RecentChangesIsNotTheWiki

Try: If you become bothered by the rate of change, you may want to consider bookmarking FindPage, RandomPages, or a topic page (such as ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap).

Try: to understand the other editor better. Remember, your perception may not be the truth. It is very ''very'' likely e is neither a WikiVandal, WikiFascist, nor a WikiButcher. Collaboration is hard: communication and trust are essential prerequisites.

Try: If you are the one deleting or adding a large number of pages, be willing to explain why. The editors with concerns are not always oversensitive idiots. Communication and trust should go in both directions.

Finally: GetOverIt.
