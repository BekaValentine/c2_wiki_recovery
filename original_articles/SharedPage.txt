Ward - I appreciate your concerns. Please try out the application. I hope you will be very excited - as Multitaneous
Editing will become wikis for the real time world. I agree with you that this site is not the
place to advertise washing powder. However if you look at the Shared Page technology you will
see that it is a technological advance of genuine interest to the technically minded audience of
this site. The source code is available at http://kanabos.dev.java.net I look forward to
receiving your feedback. Kind regards -- CharlesArmstrong
