Here's a list of some useful and creative Java applets on the Web. Please add descriptions (with URL) of other applets that merit inclusion.

* A complete JavaLanguage implementation of a SecureShell client in an applet.  This is useful because if you are on a machine where you can't or don't want to install software, you can still fire up a Java-enabled WebBrowser and get to any ssh-ready server you want. http://www.mindbright.se/products/mindterm/

* EuclidOfAlexandria's ''Elements'' in Java: you can manipulate the points in the diagrams, and see what effect it has. Not necessarily ''useful'' (unless you happen to be studying Euclid), but still a decidedly good use of Java. http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html

* SodaConstructor

* BallDroppings

* While not really "Useful", probably the most popular Java Applets are at yahoo games.

* WikiComposer. Also has the advantage of being a wiki (to the extent possible with music)

* Emulation World Network - multiplayer NES emulator http://www.emuwn.com
