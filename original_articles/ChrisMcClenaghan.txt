I currently work for the Object Technology Practice of IBM 
Consulting Group, formerly with US WEST Technologies, the
phone company. I'm struggling through the web to get my own
page on-line [1]. Visit me there, or send email to
mailto:mcclen@mcclenaghan.com. I love to talk about objects, use
cases and business (re)engineering.
