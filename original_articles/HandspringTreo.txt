Handspring's line of handhelds, smaller with built-in keyboard.

The most recent coolest thing in the universe.  A 16MB PalmOs machine, with a thumb keyboard (no more of that insufferable PalmGraffiti) and a GSM phone/wireless modem built in.  Smaller than a three-by-five index card, and weighs about 5 ounces.  Available with color or grayscale screen, and also available without the built-in phone.  --MikeSmith
