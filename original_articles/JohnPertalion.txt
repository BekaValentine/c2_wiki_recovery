While in school I did an assignment PairProgramming (from a point of ignorance rather than knowledge of ExtremeProgramming). We wrote a chess game server and client in Java using sockets.  In retrospect, it was the most fun, most complicated, and, relatively, most quickly completed project in my academic career.  We were both new to Java, but sitting together at one machine kept the syntax and design problems to a minimum.
