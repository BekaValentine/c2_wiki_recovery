(''OopslaProgramCommitteeMembershipPatterns'')

If a program committee is the same year after year,
it is difficult for a conference to move forward.
It develops its own ruts and blind spots, and becomes
isolated from mainstream progress.

Yet a committee learns pragmatic techniques and practices
that are part of the culture.  Part of this is the culture
of program committees, which is remarkably regular across
software conferences.  But part of this is the culture of
the conference itself.  This culture serves the industry
and must be preserved;  yet, it must change with time as
the industry changes.

'''Therefore:'''  Staff the program committee so that at
least half are old-timers, who can carry on the traditions
of the conference through time.
These experienced members also tutor the newcomers so they
can support the next generation.
This experience brings solutions to tactical problems that
would be lost on the newcomers.

A program committee is a culture, and much of the
culture of a conference derives from the program
committee culture as it is handed down from year to
year.
