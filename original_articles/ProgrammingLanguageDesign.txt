PaulGraham is currently designing ArcLanguage (http://www.paulgraham.com/paulgraham/arc.html) with comments and suggestions from the (general?) public. -- AdewaleOshineye

Walter Bright is doing something similar with DeeLanguage.  -- JohnFletcher

FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign has a section on the implications of functional patterns for language design.

Web sites useful to those interested:
* LambdaTheUltimate -- a weblog dedicated to the topic.  Many big names in the field participate there on a regular basis.
* http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/language-research.html.  A quite useful "portal" page pointing to many others.
