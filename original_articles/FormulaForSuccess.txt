A Formula for success in ChangeManagement has developed by David Gleicher and Richard Beckhard.

For a significant outcome resulting from Management initiatives, the combination of organisational dissatisfaction, vision for the future and the possibility of immediate, tactical action must be stronger than the resistance within the organisation.

''' SharedUrgency x InspiringLeadership x QuickWins - ChangeResistance > 0 '''

The above suggests that if one or more of the three driving forces is small, then the chances for success would be greatly dminished.
