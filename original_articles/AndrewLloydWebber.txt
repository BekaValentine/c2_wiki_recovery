Perhaps the "Mozart" of the 20th century.

''But does he write it all unaided?''

''And more importantly, did he start when he was five?''

 We cower in our shelters
 With our hands over our ears
 Lloyd-Webber's awful stuff
 Runs for years and years and years
 An earthquake hits the theatre
 But the operetta lingers
 Then the piano lids comes down
 And breaks his fucking fingers
      -- ''It's a Miracle'' by RogerWaters

British composer of musicals; especially several which have done thousands of shows and are widely loved by the general public (and widely despised by many theatre buffs). Among other things, wrote...

* JesusChristSuperstar
* Evita (Lyrics by Tim Rice)
* PhantomOfTheOpera (one of many musicals based on the novel - there are others)
* StarlightExpress

Yeah Right, this guy's right up there with Billy Joel, Paul Mc''''''Cartney, Elton John and all the other wonder boys of establishment pop rock drivel. Mozart was just in a different century, that's all!

Mozart of the 20th century? Which Mozart was that? Certainly not Wolfgang Amadeus. While ALW is competent as a composer of musicals, his repertoire has neither the musical breadth nor the depth of Mozart's pinkie finger, let alone Mozart. A better comparison might be Salieri, who was quite popular in his time - though history has been unkind to his works. 

And that's being ''nice'' to Lloyd-Webber. A harsher critic would accuse him of composing simplistic, mediocre, bombastic, and commercially-driven rubbish. Plus, even if you consider Lloyd-Webber's offerings to be meritorious, he is most decidedly a charter member of CategoryCows.
