''You'll never know if you don't find out.'' -- MatthewTheobalds

Have you ever tried driving 6" nails into your skull? Ever tried drinking battery acid? Ever tried sky-diving without a parachute? I never have. I guess I'll never know what doing that is like. It somehow feels as if this is no loss.

''Someone -- I think it was ThomasBeecham -- once said, "I believe that you should try everything once, except incest and Morris dancing."''

With some appropriate restrictions this idea is suggested by the Bible:
 
    Try everything. Keep the best. 

(I freely translated this from German and memory. Does anybody know the English version and the reference?) 

In medicine there is something similar, called polypragmasie.
