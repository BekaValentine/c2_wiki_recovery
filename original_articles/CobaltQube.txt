A small (approx. 1 foot cubed) cobalt blue computer sold by Cobalt Micro.  These machines run linux (although the user needent know that), and are popular with VARs.

''VARs?''

----
I've used 'em, they're decent. The small size means they're cheaper to colocate, the MIPS chip is decently fast, but  mips-linux doesn't always have libraries available, so not everything will compile.
