A minimalistic testing framework for LinuxKernel development in the form of a single header file:

http://www.kernel.org/
----
Output looks something like this:

footest(): OK

bartest(): OK

anttest(): drivers/video/supergfx.c: 345


which means that all tests up to anttest() worked ok.
The test automatically shows which file and where in the file it fails.

A code snippet using the test framework:

 int footest(void)
 {
   if (readl(fooaddress) != 576) {
     fail ();
   }
   return 0;
 }


 int main (void)
 {
   test (footest);
   return 0;
 }
