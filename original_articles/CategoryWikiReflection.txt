(See WikiCategories)

CategoryWikiReflection is for pages which are a reflection of experience of WikiWiki.

There is a view being expressed which is that this is a trivial category which is the same as WikiHistory. I dissent from that view, on the grounds that reflection is personal testimony on what the wiki means for someone. That can be as a result of looking at the historical pattern, or it could be more immediate experience. I think it is worth capturing that and sharing it. -- JohnFletcher
