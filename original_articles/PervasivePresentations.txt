	* Sachin made a presentation on pervasive computing which gave the idea to pick this research area. The presentation was an introductory one which aimed at presenting the basic concepts of pervasive computing. Refer to (http://s.students.umkc.edu/sbs7vc/PervComp/Pervasive%20Computing%20Presentation_files/frame.htm) for details.
	* The Pervasive Computing group came with a new research idea of "Global Pervasive Computing".This area deals with making the computing technologies truly pervasive and ubiquitious across the globe. The idea woven across semantic web would integrate the "Smart Islands" of pervasive computing semantically to achieve the goal of pervasive computing truly pervasive. Sachin made this presentation which provided the main concepts behind this idea. Refer to (http://s.students.umkc.edu/sbs7vc/GPC/GlobalPervasiveComputing.ppt) for details.
	* Concept of unique identity and autonomous systems(http://s.students.umkc.edu/shpgzd/pervasive/pervasivecomputing1.ppt).
	* Pervasive Computing presentation on 12 july(http://s.students.umkc.edu/shpgzd/pervasive/pervasivecomputing2.ppt). 
	* Pervasive Group made a SCE presentation on 12 September 2003. (http://s.students.umkc.edu/sbs7vc/PervComp/pervasive-sce.ppt) for details.
	* Presentation on 26 September 2003 outlining the plan for Fall semester 2003. (http://s.students.umkc.edu/sbs7vc/PervComp/Pervasive-Plan_for_Fall_2003.ppt) for details.
