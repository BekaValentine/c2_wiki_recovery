''Occasionally, someone new to WardsWiki comes along and starts editing in ways that go against the grain of Wiki conventions''
----
Usually, a WikiGnome will just fix the edits, and life goes on.  That's WhyWikiWorks.  
* But sometimes, a new user objects to anonymous stylistic changes, even when those changes reflect the standards of the community.  
* New users aren't vandals--they just have different perspectives.  
* If we want to keep a consistent style within WardsWiki, we need to find a way to gently guide new users into good practices.

---'''Therefore,'''

WikiGnome''''''s need to be extra-cautious when making stylistic changes to the edits of new users.  
* It might be best to put a signed note on the new user's HomePage explaining the changes, and politely letting the user know that the changes aren't a personal affront.  
* If the user still takes umbrage, ''drop the issue altogether'': it's likely that another WikiGnome will do the same thing later, and might be able to phrase the explanation differently, in a way that the new user will understand  * Under no circumstances should stylistic differences escalate to the point where you SetTheBozoBit or launch personal attacks.  It's just not worth it.

---'''But,'''

Wiki is not static.  Over time, what is GoodStyle will change, so WikiGnome''''''s need to be reasonable. 
* Consider whether the stylistic differences are disruptive enough to worry about 
* Even if you think that SturgeonsLaw applies to new users' WikiInnovations, that means that at least 10% of what they come up with are good ideas and are worth leaving alone
