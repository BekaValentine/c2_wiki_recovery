Several approaches and descriptions are used to tag and discourage AgendaPushing:
* WikiSquatting
* WalledGardens
* DeleteOffTopic (Off topic is not ok)
* OnTopicButNotOk
* OnceAndOnlyOnce
* Delete, Orphan, Meta Meta Discussion
* Delete No Content
* Delete Unless Defended
* IdeasAndWork

----
There are several questions
* What is it about Agendas that makes them the target of others who 
** are not engaged in them
** are not interested in them
** do not understand them
** want to ignore them but can't
* Can an agenda be characterized in computing terms as an "Encapsulation of Ideas"
* Is it important to characterize and collect thoughts and ideas.
* What is the relationship between agendas expressing "new" ideas and the status quo?

Thoughts that are mostly right - correct them rather than replying.

It seems to me that this wiki tries to be centred on software development and patterns. Anything that has no obvious relationship to those subjects is regarded as potential deletion fodder. On the other hand, many apparently unrelated pages are tolerated. It seems that these extra-topic pages conform to one of a few ideas:

QualityWithoutaName
* Popular among programmer types
** E.g. StarTrek
* Inspirational for life choices
** E.g. ZenAndTheArtOfMotorcycleMaintenance

NoContent
* Personal, but the person in question approached in a way that engendered understanding
** Several I can't remember off-hand
