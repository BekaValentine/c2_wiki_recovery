I only wish JohannSebastianBach could also be alluded to in this ill-conceived muddle of history, cultural and intellectual change and wonderful flowering of artistic creativity in the face of the harsh and boring realities of software development at the start of the new millennium.

Yeah, I hate my job, too.

Hatred may not be enough ... but thanks.

I hear ya, mate. Harsh and boring simply do not do it justice. I make the most of it, though, by doing lots of on-the-job learning (i.e. building interesting software that's NotJobRelated while at work). It's for my next job...which will be better.

Phew. I'm relieved to hear someone else say that they spend their time at work
building interesting software that's not job related. I've been feeling guilty.

What do you expect? I'm *obscenely* mismanaged!

Time to look for an R&D job at a company which is doing things you find fascinating.  I just made that move--now I get to do what I want, get paid for it, and feel not the slightest guilt! --AlexCruise
