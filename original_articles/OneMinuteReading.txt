A more tutorial-style orientation would be better, and a reference to NewUserPages.

''What do you mean by "tutorial-style orientation" in the above? The current text already references NewUserPages. OneMinuteWiki: I know I was the first to put in a section about Reading, but in hindsight it may be best to say nothing about reading, and just include a link to this page (or equivalent) in a SeeAlso section. -- RalphMellor''

A complete newbie (speaking from prior experience) will be unfamiliar with the way Wiki is typically read (i.e. the fact that it is a highly interconnected web of pages rather than a typical hierarchical style of web-site.) Saying 'NewUserPages and StartingPoints are good places to start' isn't enough because it would tend to lead them down a winding path of links without any guidance. OneMinuteWiki should be the page that provides this guidance. By tutorial-style I mean that it should explain as much as possible without resorting to links. E.g. it could mention that one style of reading is to follow interesting links and get 'lost' in wiki, whereas another style is to read entire pages and opening up linked pages for later reading (sort of DepthFirst vs BreadthFirst).

Basically, it's the first piece of advice, and it should inform the newbie how to read the rest of the page and the rest of wiki. Of course, it should be brief, too. Maybe something like this: "Read pages you find interesting and follow links to other interesting pages, or open the links in new windows for later reading. Use the browser's back button to avoid getting lost." That's not very good, but that's what I mean by tutorial style.

''Hmm. Fwiw, I think in terms of "do this, do that" instructions when I hear the word "Tutorial", but it sounds like you mean some form of guidance beyond the 100% guidance-free "try NewUserPages", not necessarily specific instructions. I agree there's a need for guidance. Dunno what form that best takes. I lean toward under-the-radar approaches such as showing a newbie VisualTour, rather than trying to explain in a sentence something like using the back button. (If they already know about that button, there's little need to remind them. If they don't, a single sentence probably isn't going to make much difference.)'' -- RalphMellor

Everybody knows that the back button exists; it's how we typically use it with Wiki that might not be common knowledge. Also, lots of people don't know that you can open links in new windows, which is also a good way of exploring Wiki.
