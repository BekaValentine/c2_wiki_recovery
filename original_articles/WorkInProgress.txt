Since Wiki provides the ability to edit any WikiPage, and is therefore constantly evolving, some consider every WikiPage to be a WorkInProgress. WorkInProgress is often used more specifically as a WikiTag on a WikiPage that is currently under development.

The most obvious sign of a WorkInProgress wiki page is that much of the content is in ThreadMode conversation. As development nears "completion", ThreadMode comments are sometimes moved into a new WikiPage of the same title with the suffix ''Discussion''. The valuable content from the discussion is then refactored back into the original page. In many cases, this refactoring is comprehensive enough that the discussion page becomes unnecessary.

In general, a product or project past the inception stage but prior to the completion stage is also considered to be a WorkInProgress.

My Convention - some guidelines
* Use this as a TransientTag:
**  to indicate a page which is constructed and is in the process of editing.
**  applied to the top of such a page, is followed by Name and date of WorkInProgress, and is separated from the work by a horizonal rule. It will be removed when current work is complete. Sometimes within an hour, never less than a few hours. 
** with the hope that when wikizens see this as the first thing on a page, that they will refrain from commenting for at least an '''hour or two'''. Its use should not be abused and should only be used by an individual on '''one page at a time'''.
