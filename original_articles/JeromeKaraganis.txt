Jerome Karaganis

I'm a programmer in the (gasp) computer games industry who is very interested in bringing a little more rigorous software engineering to our traditionally "seat of the pants" game development cycle.  I'm especially looking for patterns that work well in real-time human-interactive resource-limited situations.  You can reach me at mailto:jkaraganis@high-voltage.com
