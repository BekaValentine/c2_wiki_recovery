Considered by many to be the canonical example of a BadProgrammingLanguage (a category which excludes purposefully EsotericProgrammingLanguage''''''s like InterCal and such).

In fairness to its creators; it was originally intended as an IntermediateLanguage of sorts (to be generated only by a UI-building tool) but for some reason it got turned into a source language.
