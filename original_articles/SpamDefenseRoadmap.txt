RoadMap to various types of Spams and/or Spam''''''DefensiveStrategies.

'''A very abstract definition of spam: '''

* Unwanted communication which we cannot easily prevent ourselves from receiving if we use a certain communication or information retrieval system.


'''Communication mediums that are spammable'''

* Email is spammable the moment we publish our email address in a computer readable form in a public place.  ''You don't even have to do that - spammers randomly generate email addresses.  See OptOut.''
* UseNet is highly spammable unless it is moderated.
* Bulletin boards are spammable if they are not moderated.
* The Web is not spammable if you follow links, but the moment you use a WebSearchEngine you can be exposed to SearchEngineSpam.
** If you run JavaScript you're highly spammable. Just switch it off, then complain to the webmasters who rely on it for core functionality. Help reduce JavaScriptAbuse.


Any site on the net is spammable with ''ping -f'' (flood ping) or other fun denial of service attacks (see DenialOfService on MeatballWiki).

'''Ways of dealing with SpamMail'''

Try a EmailHurdle, or use NameMangling. Whatever you do, do not use OptOut if you are spammed.

Solutions include protecting email addresses, and what to do if you do get spammed anyway.

* Use a SpiderTrap to generate BotBait
* Use NameMangling, especially for addresses posted on web pages
* make senders go through some EmailHurdle before their email can reach your eyeballs.
* trace spam by giving out unique addresses, using the plus sign technique. See SpamMail.
* Consider using "throw-away" addresses. See ThrowawayEmailAndRidYourselfOfSpam.

-----------------

One is advised not to open suspicious or untrusted emails. However, every now and then the subject of the email by ''sheer coincidence'' alines with a current legitimate project or activity. If you spam enough, you'll eventually hit that lucky coincidence and hook somebody.
