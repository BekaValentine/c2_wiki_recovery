WalterShewhart's adaptation of the ScientificMethod to manufacturing process improvement (the ShewhartCycle) was Plan, Do, Study, Act.

* Plan the change you intend to make
* Make the change
* Study the effect(s) of the change
* Act on the study

Often depicted as a circle divided into quadrants with the letters P, D, S, and A clockwise from the first quadrant, the idea is to encourage a continuing search for changes that would improve a process.
