I just picked up a new book by Lakoff called 
''MoralPolitics. What Conservatives Know that Liberals Don't'' ([ISBN 0226468054]).
Its a nice piece of work teasing apart the ConceptualMetaphor underlying political discourse.  I consider Lakoff's methods to be a bit like Alexander's, though more in line with current attitudes in cognitive psychology. -- WardCunningham

I recommend ''MoralPolitics'' as a guide to several core AmericanCulturalAssumption(s) regarding morality and politics. -- MichaelSchuerig (non-American)

I've had WomenFireAndDangerousThings ([ISBN 0226468046]) by Lakoff recommended to me from a couple of sources, but I haven't had a chance to get it yet -- MichaelFeathers

Read it now. OOP advocates will learn a bunch there about inheritance (Lakoff's Categories) when used for implementation vs specification. I've a whole page on this at http://virtualschool.edu/mon/SocialConstruction -- BradCox

Lakoff and Nunez have written a fascinating book called WhereMathematicsComesFrom ([ISBN 0465037712]), where they detail a set of metaphors that can be used to explain mathematics. The book has a set of case studies at the end, that purport to explain the meaning of, for instance, the identity e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0.
