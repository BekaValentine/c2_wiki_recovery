''The purpose of the demo was to illustrate the benefits of an OnsiteCustomer to a non-programming audience.''

Half of us are customers, half programmers.  There were enough of us to form nine waterfall / XP teams and six analyst teams.

Customers are given a piece of paper with five groups of graphical shapes, squiggles, and lines. This is "the vision" which must be communicated by the customer to the programmer. Three of the shapes have straight lines, and must be completed for the product to "survive".  Two of the shapes use curved lines, and make your product "dominate" if they are also completed. 

In the WaterFall exercise, the customer creates a requirements document that contains only text (no graphics that reflect the actual vision).  There is no other communication between the programmer and customer.

Then do the exercise the ExtremeProgramming way: not showing the programmer the drawing, but interactively talking about it.

We took the extra time to do it one more time, this time with intervening "BusinessAnalyst''''''s" who were not allowed to see the picture
but were allowed to take notes and talk to the programmers.  Programmers were allowed to send analysts back with questions.

Results: 
* Only one waterfall project survived in the market.
* Six XP projects survived or dominated.
* One analyst project survived.

''Can we have more data on these "failures" and "survivals" and "dominations"?''
