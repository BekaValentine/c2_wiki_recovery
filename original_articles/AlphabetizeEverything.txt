Okay, objection. C'mon, now -- do we really need pages like this one, Donald? I'm not trying to be mean or pick a fight here. Who could possibly need to be reminded of this simple precept? I mean, really. -- YouKnowWho

There are many pages in this wiki that can be classified by '''us''' as ''not needed - as reminders'', but pages do not exist simply because they are needed by someone, some group, or everyone. They exist because someone created them, whether for furnishing information, providing jumping off places, or for establishing contexts and contents within a wiki environment. 

This page provides one method of organization, one choice of many possible choices.
