	"Psychographics":	A term sometimes used in the marketing community to describe consumer buying motivation. Demographics studies ''which'' people buy, psychographics studies ''why'' people buy.

Well, maybe not.)

I am only going to present information about Visionaries and Pragmatists here. For more information, get CrossingTheChasm, it's only $16.00 and it will give you a completely new perspective on development, in spite of what GeoffreyMoore says on page 207. 8^)

''See TechnologyAdoptionLifeCycle for a definition of Visionaries, Pragmatists, and other such animals.''

Quotes from CrossingTheChasm by GeoffreyMoore:

	 :	''"Visionaries are that rare breed of people who have the insight to match an emerging technology to a strategic opportunity, the temperament to translate that insight into a high-visibility, high-risk project, and the charisma to get the rest of their organization to buy into that project."''

	 :	''"The core of the (Visionaries') dream is a business goal, not a technology goal, and it involves taking a quantum leap forward in how business is conducted in their industry or by their customers."''

	 :	''"Visionaries are not looking for an improvement; they are looking for a fundamental breakthrough."''

	 :	''"(Pragmatists) ... do not want to be pioneers ("Pioneers are people with arrows in their backs"), who never volunteer to be an early test site ("Let somebody else debug your product"), and who have learned the hard way that the "leading edge" of technology is all too often the "bleeding edge"."''

	 :	''"... the goal of pragmatists is to make a percentage improvement -- incremental, measurable, predictable progress."''

	 :	''"The Fortune 2000 MIS community, as a group, is led by people who are largely pragmatist in orientation."''

You can probably see the chasm beginning to form; risk-taking vs risk-averse, quantum leap vs incremental improvement, etc. The real chasm though lies in the way these two groups make their buying decisions. Visionaries reference Innovators and other Visionaries. Pragmatists only reference other Pragmatists in their market segment.

Visionaries and Pragmatists don't have a lot of respect for each other. Visionaries get too much attention, too much credit, too much of the budget, and when their project is over, they disappear only to leave some poor Pragmatist to clean up the mess. Pragmatists are too cautious, don't get the new technology, and in general worry about trivial stuff like legacy systems way too much.


In InsideTheTornado, Moore gives an easy test for visionary vs. pragmatist:

	 :	The visionary says, "I see!" with his eyes closed.

	 :	The pragmatist says, "I see." with his eyes open.
