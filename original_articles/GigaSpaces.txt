GigaSpaces XAP (eXtreme Application Processing) is a software infrastructure for developing real-time, clustered and synchronized distributed applications and services. By using the GigaSpaces Platform, applications today can access shared and global information with great speed as if accessed from the local memory. As the first commercial implementation of Sun's JavaSpaces technology, XAP behaves as a distributed shared memory pool (space), where applications and services communicate via the space in a loosely-coupled, event-driven, and high-performance manner. XAP facilitates real-time performance via distributed caching, collaboration, integration, virtualization of data sources, generic clustering solution, and parallel computation.
