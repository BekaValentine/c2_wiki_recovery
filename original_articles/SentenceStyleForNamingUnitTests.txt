A method of naming UnitTest''''s that allows the test class to be read as descriptive documentation of the class under test.  Invented by ChrisStevenson.

A unit test class is named after the class under test.  E.g. a test for the Sheep class would be called Sheep''''''Test or Sheep''''''Tests. 
 
The methods of the test class are named to complete a sentence that begins with "A ''class-under-test''...".  E.g. the methods of Sheep''''''Test would be named to continue the sentence "A Sheep...".

For example, in Java:
	
	public class Sheep''''Test {
	        @Test public void eatsGrass() { ... }
	        @Test public void bleatsWhenFrightened() { ... }
	        @Test public void producesDeliciousMilk() { ... }
	        @Test public void movesAwayFromSheepdogs() { ... }
	}

This can be read as:

	* A Sheep eats grass
	* A Sheep bleats when frightened
	* A Sheep produces delicious milk
	* A Sheep moves away from sheepdogs

There are tools that generate documentation from tests written with this convention.  For example, TestDox

More expressive languages do not need this convention, because tests can be implemented as blocks associated with string descriptions of what is being tested.
