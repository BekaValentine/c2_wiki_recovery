Crosby's "Quality Management Maturity Grid" ("QualityIsFree" ISBN0451625854) consists of five stages of management maturity (Uncertainty, Awakening, Enlightenment, Wisdom, and Certainty), measured against six dimensions, to complete the matrix:

	1. Management understanding and attitude [towards quality management]
	1. Quality organization status
	1. Problem handling experience
	1. Cost of quality as a percentage of sales
	1. Quality improvement actions
	1. Summation of company quality posture

Crosby suggests the model does not require inordinate management sophistication.  He recommends the Grid measurement be used in two ways:  (1) a comparison tool, i.e., where an organization is, where it was, and where it wants to be; (2) a directional compass, always pointing (and motivating) the organization in the right direction.

[ Unfortunately, the matrix is very concise.  Even if FairUse allowed its reproduction here, there's still the issue of HtmlTables (or rather, the lack thereof). ]
