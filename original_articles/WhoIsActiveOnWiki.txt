A shameless marketing study conducted by yours truly, CostinCozianu. Just kidding of course, there might be  a noble and honorable intention behind it. The idea would be to gather some data about whether we are doing a good job or not, or whether it's a job worth doing. Ahem, in order to avoid polluting this page too much I'll write it over to WikiSurveyMotivation, I'll promise to give a more detailed account later. 

So please tell me - us, if you will (I ask this as a personal favor to me but others are welcome to join my plea), what's your name to begin with. If you consider yourself "active" on this wiki for a very loose definition of active, for example you read what's new at least once a week, let's say. That would be the minimum amount of information. But the more your disclose about your usage of wiki the better you can help the community.

September 05, the survey is closed for its initial purpose. As stated  and promised initally, data is anonymized at the end of it. Thank you so much to the people who participated. If other people want to participate after closing, please append your answers with your username to the list (the initial non-anonymous nature is needed to keep it honest). We'll make sure it's anonymized after 1 month. --CostinCozianu

For example:

*'''WR0''':  how much and if wiki is useful to you. One of (very - 4, useful - 3, somewhat - 2, pastime - 1, a matter of habit, better get rid of it - 0)
*'''WR1''':  the frequency with which you learn something new/useful/insightful on wiki as of lately. X per week/ X per day/ X per year, etc.
*'''WR2''': In case the 1.0 [WR0?] score is better than 0, how much of it is from new (say newer than 2004, inclusive). X per time unit.
*'''WR3''': If you peruse other online sources of informations, please list the first 5 (or less, but don't give 1000) that you find useful together with the same score as for wiki

For Wiki contributors (including potential contributors in the form of WikiReader''''''s who considered at least once to edit, but did not do it, please answer WC2 and WC3 ) : 

*'''WC0''' How often do you add a new page. X per time unit.
*'''WC0.5''' How often do you modify a page. X per time unit.
*'''WC1''' In case the score at 1.0 [WC0?] is greater than 0, how do you rate the experience with regards to where most of your pages end, and the input you receive from other people. Please answer with: (3 - very satisfied) -> (2 - satisfied -- kind of OK but no big deal) -> ( 1 - negligible, meaning mild failure, the page ended nowhere) -> 0 - disillusioned (the page ended up just wrong, better if it didn't exist)
*'''WC2''' If you see a topic that matches your area of "competence" (again, defined loosely : you have an interest like you've dreamt of programming 3d games in the future, or you read a book, or you've dealt with it in your latest project) how likely are you to join the discussion ? The answer may vary from (4 - very interested), (3 - interested, but if I notice something obvious is wrong or missing or something's really cool, not right away), (2 - reluctant : something's blatantly wrong and nobody else bothers) , (1 - maybe later : get used with the regulars first, see what's cooking ), (0 - no way dude).
*'''WC3''' Have you seen recent pages that you are convinced are in need (for example bad programming advice, glaring omissions of relevant arguments, etc), but you did not do anything about it ? 1-yes 0-no

Survey being a delicate matter, I'd ask everybody participating and observers to refrain from engaging the discussion of any particular data reported. I also want apologize to WikiGnome''''''s who have a very important role on wiki, but their activity is not reflected in this tentative survey solely for my lack of imagination: I don't know what information would be useful to them.

Surveys are boring, I know, so feel free to complete the minimum amount of information, that would be your name which would mean you sometimes read this wiki and you feel at least motivated to share this minimal clue with us. But the more data you give, the better. If you feel extraordinarily generous and have more in-depth comments, put your name and the sterile data here, and everybody'll be grateful if you can add a blog-style entry to your HomePage. Don't have one yet, please create it, you can delete it later and C2 wiki is not google indexed these days at all -- nobody will know. Nobody should post any comment/reply/etc to such blog entries, unless the author specifically requests to, most likely nobody will, and if somebody tries regardless it'll be dealt with. 

ThankYou.
