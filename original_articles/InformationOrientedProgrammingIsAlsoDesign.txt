InformationOrientedSoftwareEngineering (IOSE) is a form of design so that if you build something using IOSE, you are not only programming but you are engaging in the information design space, you are actually doing design. Even if you throw out what you have built, you have still done lasting work in that you now understand the application space better than you did before.

This is because information exists more strongly in the user's/customer's realm than the programming realm.

Therefore IOSE is sometimes one of the YagniExceptions.
