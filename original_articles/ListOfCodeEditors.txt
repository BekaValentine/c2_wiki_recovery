This is a place to put a brief description of code editors that are capable of editing more than one language.

Characteristics to specify, if possible, include:

* Name of editor
* Vendor (or state "open source")
* Cost (if applicable)
* Programming languages it can edit or has templates for
* Platforms
* Scripting language it uses, if any. (This is not the same as what it edits, but rather it's user-scriptable event-handling language.)

Please try to keep in alphabetic order.

''Note:'' There is a lot of information already available on different editors. A search on the word ''editor'' reveals about 50 pages and there are a lot of things in C''''''ategoryTextEditor and more in C''''''ategorySoftwareTool. Not all of these will be code editors, but a lot are.
