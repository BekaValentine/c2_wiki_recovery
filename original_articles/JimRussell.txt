I've considered myself a computer guy since I got my first job, with IBM, back in 1957. I do Java, VB, APL, J, Perl, AWK, etc.

My current interest is reducing the cost and effort of developing typical Information System applications and improving the value of the IS expenses to an enterprise.

My (vaporware) ''Killer App'' is 
an ''App Killer''; an Information Systems framework (I call DOIT, for Document Oriented Information Technology) which I believe could substantially reduce the risks and costs of information system development as we know it. My thesis is that the DoItFramework would provide a new and powerful answer to the IS problems faced by business today.
