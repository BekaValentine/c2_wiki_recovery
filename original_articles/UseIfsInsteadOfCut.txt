The cost of using the '''cut(1)''' program for several consecutive operations is high. In UsingXargsForRepetition, each iteration parameter was separated from the next by a newline.  Unfortunately, the '''read''' Shell utility cuts on whole line boundaries.  We can input lines with '''read''' and then split them using '''cut''',  separating fields by their delimiters:
 while read line
 do
	f=`cut -f1 -d';'`
	d=`cut -f2 -d';'`
	c=`cut -f4 -d';'`
	...
 done
However, this spawns a Shell process for each parameter on each line, and most of the real time will be expended in process creation.  It violates intuition to create a process to pick off each parameter.  Yet we must create a new process to use '''cut'''.

'''Therefore:'''

use the Input''''''Field''''''Separator ('''IFS''') variable and '''read/line/set'''. Use this instead of the above code:
 '''IFS'''=';'
 while read f d junk1 c junk2
 do
	...
 done
The use of '''junk2''' is important to make sure that fields following 'c' are not put into the value of 'c'.
