Quotable former manager (and catcher) with the New York Yankees.  Nowadays most recently seen in an insurance commercial with a big white duck.  Not to be confused with Yogi Bear.

Yogi had a way of making a tautology informing. For example:

* It ain't over til it's over.

Not to mention contradictions:

* If people won't come to the ballpark you can't stop them.
* Never answer an anonymous letter.
* Nobody goes there anymore. It's too crowded.
* (loosely quoted) You should attend funerals, because if you don't go to people's funerals, they won't go to yours.

On decision-making:

* When you come to a fork in the road, take it.
