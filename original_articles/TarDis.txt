''When considering patterns, could the DoctorWho Tardis be considered a Facade? '' ThinkingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20131129

''The Tardis is no more (or less) an exemplar of the FacadePattern than anything else.  An automobile dashboard is an example of FacadePattern.  A computer keyboard and screen are an example of FacadePattern.  Any simplified and unified interface to a complex system can be considered an example of FacadePattern.''

It has but one entrance and exit point, its door. It has a particularly unique characteristic: it can travel in more than three dimensions, and in any direction in the time dimension, where it is taken to be the 4th dimension. 

Mathematics and Software make abstractions allowing for multi-dimensional structures and virtual worlds and spaces utilizing them. The Tardis in DoctorWho seems to be the Facade representing the boundary between the real space-time which is traveled in a forward direction of time,  and the fictional Sci-Fi scenario where space and time can be travelled merely by the manipulation of controls within the Tardis.
