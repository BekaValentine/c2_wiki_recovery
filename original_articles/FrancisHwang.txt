Every time I edit a page here, I try to make Wiki more useful. Sometimes I add words, sometimes I edit words, sometimes I move words, and sometimes I delete words. 

If you have a problem with any edit I make, please feel free to speak up about it. Please note that I'm human like everybody else, which means you'll get further with me if you are polite.

I'm a software engineer, artist, and writer who lives in NewYorkCity. My day job is at Rhizome (http://rhizome.org), where I have discovered that I enjoy fulfilling tech requests from artists and academics far more than I enjoy fulfilling similar requests from marketing execs. Astounding!

My current free software project is the LafcadioFramework: It's an object-relational mapping framework for use with RubyLanguage and MySql. It's available at http://lafcadio.rubyforge.org/. My current let's-save-NewYorkCity-tech-culture project is RubyNewYorkCity, which you can visit at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ruby-nyc/.

If you want to know more than that, you can check out my site at http://fhwang.net. If you want to ask me, you can email me at mailto:sera@fhwang.net.

''You might wish to correct "to her from across the street" to "to hear from across the street" in http://fhwang.net/blog/18.html.''

Thanks for the heads-up: I just fixed it.

Pages I'm proud of starting:
	 :	AntoniGaudi | ConversationalChaff | DeleteDontJustify | IsProgrammingMath | MetaphorSmackdown | RefactorerExMachina | TheInternetIsNotYourLife | WalledGarden | WhenSomeoneLeavesWiki | SeedCrystal

Pages I've started that may turn out to be complete poppycock:
	 :	DidWeEverHaveAnArchitecture | TextInsideOfCodeInsideOfText

Thank you for your WikiGnome work today (Sat 2004Mar27); that was badly needed. -- DougMerritt

''I saw the following reference "Hwang, F. Commando Line Interface. Wired 8, 2 (February 2000), 52" in an article about PSDoom. Is that you?''

Yup. That article (minus the screenshot that ran with it in the print version) is at http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/eword.html?pg=4 . -- francis

I am looking for a good book (or two or three) to help me get a good foundation in dealing with concurrency in general. I tried to find references to such books in our pages but couldn't find any. Anybody have some pointers for me? -- francis

If you're working in JavaLanguage, or are willing to try to extract general principles from a language-specific book, DougLea's ''ConcurrentProgrammingInJava'' covers the topic reasonably well. He concentrates on principles and techniques, using Java for the examples. -- MarkIrons

I came to this page to write something like this, and found that it was already here. So I second it. -- AdamSpitz
