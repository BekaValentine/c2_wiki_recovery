Just a programmer hooked on reading Wiki like many others I'm sure!

I primarily program in the following languages, I'd love to just do Smalltalk and drop the rest.''
* SmalltalkLanguage
* CsharpLanguage
* RubyLanguage
* VisualBasic
* JavaScript

I studied and/or used infrequently the following languages. I love Smalltalk and Lisp, steal my best patterns from them.
* VbScript
* JavaLanguage
* LispLanguage
* PythonLanguage

I make most posts anonymously, I like the WikiWay. I'm also an XPJunkie, OOJunkie, and Functional''''''Junkie.
