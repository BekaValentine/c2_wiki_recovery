Anyone out there have any ideas of how to find him? I've searched on the Internet, but there are an amazing number of JimVanBuskirk's out there. 

'''Description of long lost brother JimVanBuskirk:'''

* Brother of RachelStruthers, Liza (aka Sister Bernadette), Charlie, Doug (we all miss him!!!!)
* About 50 years old
* 6 feet 3 inches tall
* Was of slender build when I last saw him (when he was in his 20's)
* Wavy light brown hair
* Blue eyes
* Extremely intelligent
* Used to love chess (but couldn't find a recent US chess rating for him)
* Possibly attended a university in Colorado in the 80's
* Was into physics, math, chemistry
* Was into baseball (especially the hapless Cubs)
* Could fungo hit a baseball a country mile 

I don't know if this is the appropriate place to post this - but thought i would give it a try. I'm thinking this wiki does make sense for this - the probability of him being "into" software is high.

''What do you mean by "recent"? How could he ever have had a ranking without giving some details of himself, or would old records have been destroyed?''

I think this is him:

This last published rating is from the years 1990-1991. How would I get more information?

I knew someone with same name and discription. if you have not found him contact me at chance325@msn.com
