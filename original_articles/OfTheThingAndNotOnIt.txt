A branch of a tree, not a picture on a wall. Wright refers to harmony of forms as part of his OrganicArchitecture. To quote that page:

''ORNAMENT is to architecture what efflorescence of a tree or plant is to its structure. OfTheThingAndNotOnIt. Ornament is the character of structure revealed and enhanced. If not well conceived, architecture is destroyed by ornament.''
