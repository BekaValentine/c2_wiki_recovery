AnyThing is a data type for representing simple values (integers, real numbers, strings) as well as sequences and dictionaries of AnyThings. AnyThing was invented by AndreWeinand (and some others simultaneously).

Some Smalltalkers say they prefer either OrderedCollection or Dictionary as their preferred class for collecting things. AnyThing is both combined into one.

This has a great benefit for developers. They do not need to think what data structure to select (e.g. from the huge STL options), they just use AnyThing without the need to make a decision. In those cases where AnyThing performance is insufficent, those clever enough to recognize are usually aware of alternative options.

In addition AnyThing makes an ideal catch-all parameter and context implementation in request processing systems. I wonder why the Java guys didn't use such a single universal mechanism when they still had the choice.

Gee, such a great idea. I wonder why LISP doesn't have it...
