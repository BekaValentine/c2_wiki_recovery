I was at Oracle briefly, and moved on to a startup; maybe I'm still there...

When I was active here I did R&D for a wee software startup, Metagon Technologies, which spun off of, and was later reabsorbed by, a small software company, Decision Support, Inc (http://www.dsinc.com).  Before that I spent some time at the late ApolloComputer (and its subsequent HewlettPackard incarnation), and before that at DartmouthCollege.

I'm interested in all sorts of things related to software, especially distributed computing and code-simplifying infrastructures or patterns.  I have a long-standing interest in how the "art" of software is acquired and communicated, and I'm particularly intrigued by Patterns as a potential documentary and pedagogical tool.
