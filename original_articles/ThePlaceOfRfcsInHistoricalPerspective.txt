'''What is an RFC?'''

The collaboration which formed the medium we enjoy today was organized and generated by a method of collaboration called RequestForComments, or RFC.

An RFC is a document describing the standards that make the Internet work. It begins as an Internet Draft. The Draft is proposed to the IETF, whereupon voting and modification occurs until it either becomes obsolete due to lack of interest or is accepted by the IESG, whereupon it is assigned an RFC number and published as an RFC. The process of producing an RFC is described in RFC 2026. The documents are produced by the IETF and can be found at http://www.rfc-editor.org, the home of the RFC Editor. While the RFC Editor is not a single individual, but rather a group which is supported by the Internet Society.

'''Collaboration'''

The importance of collaboration and establishment of Standards and Protocols as well as the hardware and wiring to support it were essential to the forming of Arpanet and the Internet as we know it today.

'''What of RFC's History?'''

One can observe and appreciate the effort involved in the cooperation of individuals and institutions in the process. The history of the last 30 years of RFC progress can be found at ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2555.txt

Details of Current and Past Activity: http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/
  Collaborations are underway on many areas by the following WorkingGroups:
  Web Services Architecture Working Group
    http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/arch/
  Web Services Description Working Group
    http://www.w3.org/2002/ws/desc/
  Web Services Choreography Working Group
    http://www.w3.org/2003/01/wscwg-charter
  XML Protocol Working Group
    http://www.w3.org/XML/
     XML Coordination Group 
       Its role is to provide a forum for coordination between the Working Groups of the XML Activity, W3C and other organizations.

I was pretty sure somebody else would mention this, but...

RFC is a misnomer. It is supposed to be a ''request for comment,'' '''not''' a statement of didactic policy on the part of some industry board. This has become something of a problem over the years, particularly since ICANN et al started kicking out the common users from the steering and editing committees.

Thank goodness a certain software publishing house in Redmond doesn't have ''all'' the seats on those boards. But since there is no longer anyone to represent the average Joe Internet, I suppose we can see some big changes coming eventually. ''<sigh>''
