Actually each public wiki, is an open invitation to participate in creating and sharing new stuff.
But this is not normally the case in the traditional business world.

Companies have very restricted rules, whom they accept to work with and sharing the economic results.
Now that wikis become more and more mature, they are on the threshold to integrate an income model
for their wikizens.

The spirit of Openness and ExtremeProgramming, applied to business, consequently leads to a new
business paradigm: ExtremeOpenBusiness, which is in statu nascendi, inviting especially XP savvy people
to participate. So you might please consider this page as an open invitation to participate. Thank you. -- FridemarPache
