Why is there no hostname after some postings? Are those unresolved numeric addresses? Does this imply the editing/authorship of c2.com? Is this related to the issue of anonymous posting in general (OneWikiStyle)? -- ScottJohnston

The most recent version of the apache web server changed the definition of various cgi environment variables. In particular, it no longer offers dotted octets for ip addresses that cannot be reversed.

Here's a fix for this, in (sloppy) perl:
  $host = $ENV{'REMOTE_HOST'};
  $host = $ENV{'REMOTE_ADDR'} unless $host;
