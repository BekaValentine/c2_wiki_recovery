When you categorize pages, especially home pages, please add a "last edited" date. Touching a page deletes last edit info, but some pages are strong candidates for an AreYouThere tag, e.g. BenDavid has no content, but WikiGnome''''''s can't tell if it's been there for 5 minutes or 5 years. 

It is a GoodThing to preserve such information, so that WikiGnome''''''s can go about their day-to-day work.

Once upon a time this was called "'''L''''''astEdit'''", and then we had "'''PreviousLastEdit'''", which was asserted to be more correct, because when the "'''AreYouThere'''" tag got added, that was actually the "'''L''''''astEdit'''", and what you wanted was the edit before that.

Well, in the spirit of naming things properly, by what they mean, and not by a coincidence, what you really want is the '''LastRealEdit'''.

Suggested format:

* ''2005-08-16 LastRealEdit''

Putting the date first allows multiple dates to be compared more easily. If this information has been lost but you still wish to find, the WikiArchive may be of use as a last resort.
