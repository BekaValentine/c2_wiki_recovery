'''History of Merriam, and Webster:''' (from the FAQ - http://www.m-w.com/info/faq.htm)

'''When was Merriam-Webster founded?'''
	  :	In 1831, brothers George and Charles Merriam opened a printing and bookselling operation in Springfield, Massachusetts which they named G. & C. Merriam Co. The company, which was renamed Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, in 1982, has been in continuous operation since that time. For more information on the history of Merriam-Webster, see Noah Webster and America's First Dictionary, Merriam-Webster Continues Noah's Legacy, and Merriam-Webster's Ongoing Commitment.

'''Does Merriam-Webster have any connection to Noah Webster?'''
	 :	 Merriam-Webster can be considered the direct lexicographical heir of Noah Webster. In 1843, the company bought the rights to the 1841 edition of Webster's magnum opus, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language, Corrected and Enlarged''. At the same time, they secured the rights to create revised editions of the work. Since that time, Merriam-Webster editors have carried forward Noah Webster's work, creating some of the most widely used and respected dictionaries and reference books in the world. For more information, see Noah Webster and America's First Dictionary.
