I worked for the TSB IT Research department in Manchester from 1988-1990.

I am now Senior Technical Architect and O-O guru with Accenture working on the RoyalAndSunalliance Insurance account in the UK.

I was chief designer of RSAs direct sales motor insurance system. This is written in Smalltalk supports 1000 telesales users and is also on the Web. I'm a big fan of Smalltalk and eXtreme Programming, and am busy promoting XP in the big bad world of Corporate IT, with some success.

I play the saxophone and enjoy wearing silly hats.
