I am technical director at a small eLearning startup in Dublin, Ireland which you can see more about at http://www.learnex.com/ (warning: this is not recommended for those that have a long list of gripes about WhatsWrongWithFlash.)

As such I am mostly concerned with MultiMedia programming of BusinessAndEthics training software, with a heavy emphasis on the media. I also have to delve into all the issues surrounding LearningManagementSystems, as invariably our clients are more or less interested in tracking the users' use of our products.

Previously I did a lot of reasonably successful JavaLanguage projects, had a DotCom experience that is best forgotten about and taught programming on a Digital Media MA course. In a previous life I produced quite a number of MusicVideos and TvCommercials.

I hang out on the WikiWikiWeb because without DesignPatterns my job would have a really spooky ProgrammingDejaVu experience virtually every day. I only resort to ExtremeProgramming as a last resort though, because mostly I work alone!
