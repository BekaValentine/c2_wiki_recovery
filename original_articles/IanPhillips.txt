I used to work as a consultant for TIBCO Software Inc. (http://www.tibco.com/) doing enterprise architecture related work, at various locations around Europe, after that I spent a short time working as a technical architect (let's not get into the whole ''what is an architect'' thing, ok?) for Infogain (http://www.infogain.com/) in the UK. Now I do freelance contract work. If you'd like to hire me send me a mail.

I can be reached (regarding work or anything else) at mailto:ianp@ianp.org

Please treat me as an OpenAuthor, I just sign stuff so that you know to whom you are talking.
