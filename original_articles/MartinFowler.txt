[''This page is about Martin Fowler. If you find his name funny, you're thinking of TheOtherMartinFowler'']

I was an independent consultant, but am now employed by ThoughtWorks with the imposing title of Chief Scientist. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to carry out any experiments yet.

The author of:
	* AnalysisPatterns
	* UmlDistilled
	* RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode
	* PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture
	* PlanningExtremeProgramming : The XP Planning book

Currently I'm working on revising AnalysisPatterns (this probably won't be done till well into 2001).

Martin keeps more thoughts under less hair than anyone I know. My first introduction to him was at a workshop of luminaries. His first words were, "I'm the only person here I've never heard of." That and his habit of gently imposing civility have endeared him to me.

MartinFowler's name on an article that says "Unit tests lie, but the compiler doesn't."?
It can't be!
