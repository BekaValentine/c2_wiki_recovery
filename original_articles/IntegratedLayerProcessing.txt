IntegratedLayerProcessing is a design principle for protocols for DistributedComputing. Here it is in a pattern form... 

'''Integrated Layer Processing'''

Dividing protocol software into layers incurs a performance penalty. Layers cannot share information as easily, data must be transferred between layers, layers might need to keep track of the same information and protocol messages might end up containing redundant headers.

''Therefore:'' integrate multiple layers into one to allow efficient cooperation of their algorithms.

'''Related Patterns'''

IntegratedLayerProcessing is fundamental to ApplicationLayerFraming.
