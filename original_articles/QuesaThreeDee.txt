Quesa3d--3D Graphics framework featuring source- and binary-compatibility with Apple's now-discontinued Quickdraw3d.  A beautifully designed API in CeeLanguage, but with an ObjectOriented feel.  Similar in ways to Apple's CoreFoundation, in terms of design ethos.  Currently implemented on top of OpenGl.
