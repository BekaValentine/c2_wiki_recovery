I'm JustaProgrammer who occasionally remembers to lift his nose from the codeface grindstone and improve a bit, which is what led me to this Wiki :-)

I spent a few years hacking in the DylanLanguage, a couple doing almost no programming and a few standards meetings, and my last two using the JavaLanguage at Net''''''Physic <http://www.netphysic.com/>.  Love the job, but not so keen on Java ;-)

You can reach me as mailto:hg-wiki@no.spam.tameter.org (without the "no.spam", of course).
