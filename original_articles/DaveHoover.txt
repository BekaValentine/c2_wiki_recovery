JustaProgrammer since November 2000.  I enjoy programming with RubyLanguage, JavaLanguage, JavaScript and PerlLanguage. I have started to learn SchemeLanguage thrice via TheWizardBook.

Up until 2000, I was a child and family therapist.  I enjoyed my career as a therapist, but I enjoy programming more.

I joined ObtivaCorp in April 2006.  My job is to develop software developers while developing software.  I also developed MadMimi.
