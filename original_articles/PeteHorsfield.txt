I'm a Brit working in C/C++ and Java, over in the US / Baltimore area since 1998. 

As of Nov 2002, I'm beginning to get into the nitty gritty of an XML/Java web application interface to some heavy duty hardware, so this is my chance to learn XP and implement cool things like continuous integration and XP-style unit testing.

Great book: SoftwareForYourHead by JimMcCarthy and MicheleMcCarthy
