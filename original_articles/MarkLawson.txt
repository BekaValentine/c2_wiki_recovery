I run a small LotusNotes consultancy in the UK. I came across wikis from the Tcl/Tk viewpoint (tcler's wiki) and I was very impressed with the idea (the WabiSabi thing appeals to me). Lotus does a collaborative system called QuickPlace. It's very flash but awash in JavaLanguage, JavaScript, etc and slooow.

I've had a go at a wiki using Java which works reasonably well, better than the JavaScript version anyway. You can get the gpl'd guts of it at http://www.emconnecct.com/demowe.zip.

In my spare time I sail our Leisure17 around in Rutland Water and try to keep the bees from swarming into the neighbour's garden.
