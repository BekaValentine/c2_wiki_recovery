A description that is intended to be a commercial and not really describe
the thing. Such a description usually uses a lot of buzzwords designed specifically with the product in mind. It also uses buzzwords and catch phrases

The biggest transgressor is probably Brockschmidts book Inside Ole,
which runs something like a thousand pages and is one great big commercial for OLE.

The term coined by John Tibbets is "marketecture". [Tibbets, John. '''"IBM Enterprise Architectures: A Comparison of Vendor Initiatives."''' ''Trends in Technology,'' 1995.]
