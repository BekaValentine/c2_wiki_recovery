ISBN: 0131479415 We know how to build predictive plans and manage them. But building plans that only estimate the future and then EmbraceChange, challenge most of our training and skills. In AgileEstimatingAndPlanning, M''''''ikeCohn once again fills a hole in the Agile practices, this time by showing us a workable approach to Agile estimating and planning. Mike delves into the nooks and crannies of the subject and anticipates many of the questions and nuances of this topic. Students of Agile processes will recognize that this book is truly about agility, bridging many of the practices between Scrum and ExtremeProgramming."
