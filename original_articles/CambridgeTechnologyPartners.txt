Cambridge Technology Partners was a $250M publicly traded consulting company specializing in building fixed cost, fixed schedule, fast solutions.

CTP was a spinoff from CambridgeTechnologyGroup, an earlier, fixed-price fixed-schedule consulting company.

''CTP was acquired by Novell during the dot-com bust. Some of us who knew the company were neither surprised nor disappointed.''
