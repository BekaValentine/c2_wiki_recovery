Marco Poehler lives in Hamburg, Germany. 

He currently studies Business at the university of applied sciences in Hamburg. He works currently as Java Developer (SunCertifiedProgrammer, SunCertifiedWebComponentDeveloper). He likes popular open stuff like Tomcat, Struts, JBoss.

Another Idea but not planned to start before February 2004 is a online game like www.inselkampf.de. But before we start 
the new island fighting game, I have to complete the mailingarchive based on jakarta-lucene. It will be available at http://www.archive4mail.com in March 2004.

Other interests are lightweight processes like ExtremeProgramming, Martial Arts - especially JinJungKwan Hapkido.
