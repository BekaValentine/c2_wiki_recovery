Code written by a HamburgerHelper is worse than effects of CowboyCoding. Think of this person as the self-promoting team developer extension of the people who do CowboyCoding. They always want everybody on the development team to believe that they have the best answer to the problem and don't want to hear otherwise. They are all filling and little meat.

HamburgerHelper (http://www.bettycrocker.com/products/prod_hamburgerhelper.asp) is a brand name for prepackaged macaroni-style dishes that you prepare with your own ground beef. You can put as much meat in it as you like, though I actually prefer to double the macaroni and sauce myself. It's a ComfortFood for some of us. -- DavidBrantley
