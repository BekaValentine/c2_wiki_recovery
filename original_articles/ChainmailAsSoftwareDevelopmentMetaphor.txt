In the spirit of WarfareAsSoftwareDevelopmentMetaphor and MartialArtsAsSoftwareDevelopmentMetaphor, ChainmailAsSoftwareDevelopmentMetaphor seems a natural fit, albeit a little tongue-in-cheek.

How is chainmail a software development metaphor?
* Both are an inexact science
* Both are woven into progressively higher forms from lower forms
* Both use PiecemealGrowth
* Both deal with non-orthogonal issues constantly
* Both follow the "good, fast, cheap - pick two" rule
* OldCodeRusts and OldChainmailRusts - unless maintained
* SoftwareDevelopment uses unit tests to "armor the code", chainmail uses rings to "armor the body"

Additionally, chainmail has the following characteristics
* FormAndFunctionAreOne
* ItsNotAboutSpeed

''(What's with the sudden and ubiquitous use of the word "orthogonal" in tech writing recently (in 2007)?)''

I don't think it's sudden or recent, but it's definitely ubiquitous - see DefinitionOfOrthogonal.
