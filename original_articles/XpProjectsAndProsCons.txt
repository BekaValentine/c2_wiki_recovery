Could XP be used on a mainframe environment? What seems to be the most prevalent project types where XP is being applied (i.e. web development, software upgrades, ...)?

What are some of the pros and cons of using a lightweight methodology over using a heavyweight one?

''Documentation: Heavyweight = more documentation which requires more time, but you have complete documentation with few assumptions needing to be made.  Lightweight = less documentation enabling the project to finish sooner, maybe not enough documentation for another person to know exactly what is going on and why.''

How does a Lightweight SDLC Methodology differ from a Heavyweight one? Is there really a difference other than the obvious iterative approach, or is it basically the same?  What are the steps taken out of a Heavyweight methodology enabling a project using a Lightweight Methodology to complete sooner? By not executing those steps that were taken out, could that negatively impact the quality of the product? (I am just trying to figure out reasons for using a Lightweight vs a Heavyweight methodology.)
