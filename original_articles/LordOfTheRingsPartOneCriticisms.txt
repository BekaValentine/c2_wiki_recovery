They completely screwed up Lord of the Rings, corrupted the story, Peter Jackson is a JACKASS. He failed to read the book himself, he missed the art of Tolkein's story-telling and proceeded to make the movie into a comic book; he should be tarred and shot.

It sucks, since when did Arwen rescue Frodo and carry him to Rivendell after he got stabbed by the ringwraith??

And the hobbits' '''feet'''!  He got them so totally ''wrong!''  In a display of total sloppiness and butchery, that hack Jackson thought that giving hobbits long feet would be "good enough".  But he even messed up ''this important detail'', and thereby messed up the whole story!  On film, Frodo's feet appeared to be 18" long; when ''anyone'' who has bothered to read the book knows that they are 20" long!  Sheesh!  A budget of several hundred million dollars, and he can't even get ''that'' right?  PlanNineFromOuterSpace was better than ''this'' dreck!

I liked it, but I don't think Jackson realized the importance of Tom Bombadil wrt the character development of the ring. --dab
