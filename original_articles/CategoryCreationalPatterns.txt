This topic is used to categorize CreationalPatterns. A category of DesignPatterns discussed in the GangOfFour to organize patterns that parametrize the behavior of a system based on the classes of objects it creates. Or, more simply put, patterns for dynamically selecting the class of created objects. 

It is suggested that creational patterns added to the wiki or currently uncategorized should include a reference to this page.

So where are the patterns? ''Click on the title of the page, it is a BackLink.''

The backlink brings up lots of things (e.g., ChangesInWeekSix) which aren't patterns.  The things which '''are''' patterns are:

* AbstractFactoryPattern
* BuilderPattern
* FactoryMethodPattern
* MonostatePattern
* PrototypePattern
* SingletonPattern
* ObjectPoolPattern
* UtilityPattern

All but MonostatePattern and UtilityPattern are found in the GangOfFour book.
