Linguist Mario Pei was once asked by an auto mechanic how he managed to learn so many different languages in his lifetime. His response was to ask: how many parts are there in a typical automobile? How many automobile manufacturers are there, and how many models do each produce every year? How many differences are there in each make, model and year, and what quirks are there that you have to know (e.g., that most cars of a given model and year have '''x''' carburetor, but a few have a '''y''' because of a change in the production costs in mid-year)? How did ''he'' learn all of that? 

Every field has its lore and its specializations, and even the simplest jobs require the use of intelligence and experience at times. Most people have about the same capacity for learning, but their interests and natural talents may lie in different areas.
