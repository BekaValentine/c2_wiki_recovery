** "One of the key things about wikis is that they evolve. They don't just start. They don't BeginWithTheEndInMind. They just begin, and you can change them over time. ... The difference between a user, a reader and a writer is very small. Also, they integrate really well."

Well, not news exactly. This excerpt is from a UK weekly net-news roundup
mailing list called NeedToKnow, dated 20 November 1998:

	 Tim Berners-Lee, [TimBernersLee] as we recall, is always moaning about how
	 the Web was *supposed* to be annotatable - it should be as
	 easy to add and edit Web documents, he says, as it is to
	 browse them. To see what kind of mess that would have lead
	 to, you might like to check out the WIKI WIKI WEB, an easy
	 to set-up, easy-to-understand, impossible-to-administrate
	 "collaborative environment". In many ways, it's a
	 self-perpetuating mess (it took us half an hour to work out
	 how to get the source), but - like the Xanadu project it
	 superficially resembles - it can't help but gland a few key
	 geek hormones. The original Wiki is a tiny Perl script, but
	 versions now exist in Python, Squeak, and other places where
	 geeks do the Right Thing so much it becomes Wrong Again.
	 http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors
						- start here, we guess
	 http://c2.com/cgi/hp?WikiInHyperPerl
							- aha! found it

What do you think? fair commentary?

-- DavidMcNicol

Not exactly, but if you're a regular reader of NeedToKnow, then you know that the editors Danny and Dave know a lot about blogging/online life/cyber-rights and weird snack foods (respectively), and rather less about the nitty-gritty of technology, so you take their opinion with a pinch of salt.
