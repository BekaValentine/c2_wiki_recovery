An Input Metric measures what you did to get a desired result.

An Output Metric measures your output.  

I wanted a way to measure 'how extreme' my extreme programming is, so I can measure the output and correlate the answers to see if I'm doing any good.

Gathering the metrics themselves must a lightweight agile procedure, or people will feel bogged down.

ShodanInputMetric is a technique I offer for lightly measuring your XP process.

After having done that with my small team over the past year, we've come up with Xpef,
or Extreme Programming Evaluation Framework.
