** a packaged property and casualty insurance insurance software producer.  (IE:  Car and home/apartment insurance.  Think "We produce SAP for insurance companies:  It does policy management, billing and claims (instead of accounting).  It has a strong supporting architecture that enables us to configure more than customize -- to reduce the cost and risk of upgrading to new versions.)
** We replace core systems.
** based in California.  But I will primarily be traveling to customer sites all over the world to do integration work with their other systems.

'''Pages On My Mind:'''
* ''Nothing much at the moment, really.''

'''Lost''' ''(from)'' '''My Mind:'''
* Microsoft's LINQ (LanguageIntegratedQueryProject) for DotNet has certainly had my attention for some time.
** ''...particularly wishing that something that powerful could be done in the JavaLanguage.''
** I just learned from the JavaPosse that Anders NorÃ¥s introduced QuaereLibrary at the JavaOne conference -- a LanguageIntegratedQueryForJava?

* ZeroTurnaround (JavaRebel), XmlForZeroTurnaround & ClasspathHell
* AspectOrientedTheHardWay -- ''possibly a temporary distraction''

* CategoryAnt: ''TestDrivenDevelopmentOfAntScripts [Well, sorry; I'm not going to write that page. ]-:'', AntUnit, HowToRunAntFromAnAntScript, RefactoringAntScripts

* KanbanInSoftwareDevelopment:  ''InMyHumbleOpinion...''
** LeanSoftwareDevelopment/LeanProgramming is good.
** Forcing the KanbanSystem on software development teams is a train crash:  ''Kanban is a manufacturing process improvement tool.  Software development is a design process, not a manufacturing process.''

* ShakerPhilosophyInSoftwareDevelopment (and related ShakerQuote''''''s)

* the concept of ConceptOrientedProgramming  ;->  ''It's a WalledGarden.  And it seems to lack merit.''
* ProductionCodeVsUnitTestsRatio
* PrevalenceIsAcid and AtomicConsistentIsolatedDurable
* HomoiconicLanguages -- for a while, mostly to make a completely pointless argument that Java and C# are homoiconic.  ''(Just a little!!!  ;-)''

* Always interested in TestingFramework -- ''particularly when I add one or need one!''

* TerracottaSharedMemoryPool - for its distributed PrevalenceLayer attributes. - http://terracotta.org/
* NetKernel - ''most interesting, but not OpenSource'' - http://1060.org/
* PowerShell should be very useful.  But how can I integrate it with my JDBC drivers?!?  ;->   (We're doing Java here!  ;-)

'''WikiReadersBackground:'''

I started programming in 1976, professionally in 1981, most of it being contracting-style engagements, typically about a year on each project.
''(3 to 5 years per employer.)''
Client/server projects have tended to be risky:
Even at the end of a successful project, most companies have not (historically) been prepared to start another risky project right away, so I'm often off to greener pastures.
''(So call me a mercenary!  ;-)''

Almost every customer I've worked for has tried to hire me.  Some have even succeeded.

I've done a lot of work in C++ on Windows and Unix, with various relational databases.
And VisualBasic (VbClassic) -- mostly with VbUnit (VbUnitThree).
And lots and lots of other stuff.
''(Ask me what I '''haven't''' done.  I find it easier to answer that question.  ;-)''

An "NT" on the MyersBriggs test.
''(...like many other programmers.)''
