A TspLaunchCoach is a person trained to coach project teams using the TeamSoftwareProcess. The coach plays a key role in providing team members trained in the PersonalSoftwareProcess with the support they need to be successful with this HighDisciplineMethodology.

TSP coaching includes
	* 'Launch'ing projects at the beginning
	* 'Re-launch'ing projects periodically
	* Advising project team members on a daily or weekly basis
	* Doing periodic 'checkpoints'
	* Guiding project teams through 'post-mortems'
The TspLaunchCoach role is somewhat analogous to TheCoach in XP, but does not include any ChiefArchitect aspects; the coach does not perform direct project tasks.

A prospective TspLaunchCoach must first become certified as a PspInstructor by the SoftwareEngineeringInstitute to be eligible for TSP Launch Coach training. After the training is
successfully completed, the prospective coach must successfully launch a real TSP project under the mentorship of a member of the SeiTspTeam to become fully certified as a TSP Launch Coach.
