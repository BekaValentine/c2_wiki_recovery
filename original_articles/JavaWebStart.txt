I have Java runtime 1.4.2.05, read news that I should upgrade to 1.4.2.06 in order to patch up serious bug discovered Nov04. I have since downloaded j2re-1_4_2_06-windows-i586-p-iftw.exe and j2re-1_4_2_06-windows-i586-p.exe (whats the difference?). 

And then I discovered I have JavaWebStart installed in in 1.4.2.05 directory.

''So how do I upgrade to the new version, and have the old version removed?
Do I have to remove the applications that use JavaRuntime first?''
