ComponentbasedScalableLogicalArchitecture (CSLA) is an implementation framework using MicrosoftDotNet products. This has been promoted by RockfordLhotka, who has written books and have active forums on discussion of his architecture (see http://www.lhotka.net/ArticleIndex.aspx?area=CSLA%20.NET)

He has responded to queries to the stability of his architecture in light of technological changes, see for example, an article on MicrosoftIndigo and WindowsLonghorn on CSLA at http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=bfb3f6ca-ea54-4365-a497-80a7220b13c3

Note Rockford has been a proponent of BusinessObject for many years, dating from VbClassic days. He has this CSLA thing developed even then (which I missed, I was on BigBlue stuff then). See http://www.lhotka.net/ArticleIndex.aspx?Area=Distributed%20Objects

''I would appreciate software architects frequenting this site tell us more about the essence of CSLA, whether it will likely be a significant player in the ServiceOrientedArchitecture arena, its perceived strengths and weaknesses.  -- DavidLiu ''
