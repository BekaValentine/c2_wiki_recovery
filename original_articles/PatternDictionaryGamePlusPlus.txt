Let's play the PatternDictionaryGame++

Here's how it is played:
* Take any positive word, statement or cliche
* State how it could be applied as a software pattern
* For double points, state it's opposite as well(see TriteSayingsComeInPairs) - this results in a zen balance

''Example''
Cliche and counter-cliche
* Silence is golden
* The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
 
So:
* Apply ReportBugsSilently and SilentFailureNoisySuccess to avoid annoying the user
* Allow the software to ExposeErrors to curious developers

Note: This is the cleaner refactored form of the PatternDictionaryGame

Playing this game provides insight into how software development patterns are ubiquitous and rooted in reality.
