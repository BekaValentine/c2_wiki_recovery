An ElementaryPattern is a pattern like any other, but it is intended for novices. Most ElementaryPattern''''''s are written by educators for students.

Some ElementaryPattern''''''s are well known design patterns of the simpler sort like BobbyWoolf's NullObject. Others are written especially for novices.
