JavaHelp is an open-source tool for creating .CHM-like help pages for Java applications.

http://onjava.com/onjava/2003/10/15/javahelp_docbook.html

It used to be available from
http://java.sun.com/products/javahelp/download_binary.html#download
After Oracle bought Sun, Oracle moved the page without providing a forwarding address.

According to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javahelp-138536.html,
"The JavaHelp project has moved to http://javahelp.java.net/. All documentation and downloads can be found on java.net."
Unfortunately, Oracle has confused the licensing terms for JavaHelp, as discussed at
http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=9532475

Oracle seems to be continuing to develop JavaHelp, but is calling the new versions "Oracle Help for Java": http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24382_01/doc.1112/e16280/toc.htm  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/index-083946.html

Are there any quick-start guides to getting started in JavaHelp -- that still work?
