''Semantics are the mapping from language structures to their meanings.'' 

I have heard and used the phrase "semantically pleasing" when a solution to a requirement takes the form of a clear and readily understandable specification. Of course, the sense of that solution may be clear only to those who are present. I cannot know if any semantically clear solution is clear to anybody other than the local audience. I would have to ask those others.
