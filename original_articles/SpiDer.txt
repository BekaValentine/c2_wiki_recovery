This title is UgLy. Any chance of changing it to something else, say, Spider''''''Wiki?

Actually, "Spider". A WikiClone developed at Intergraph (India) for maintaining internal Web sites. -- PratapLakshman

Is this really publicly available, or not? Where are you guys in India?

Perhaps not, but you can get source code for an AspWiki here: http://home.adelphia.net/~dinoch/wiki.asp 

And see that code run: http://www6.ewebcity.com/dpchiesa/wiki.asp

Are there any impressive wiki Web sites that I can look at?

''I'm afraid that site is not working. However, if you are looking for ASP implementation, you can take a look at WikiAsp. At least it's a very simple version and impressive.''
