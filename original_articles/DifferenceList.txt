A DifferenceList is a way to express how a list differs from another list.

It is a concept quite common in languages with PatternMatching or Unification, such as PrologLanguage or OzLanguage.

For example, a list expressed as
 Head = [a,b,c]
 Tail = [c]
is equivalent to
 difflist = [a,b]
since c is what you get subtracting tail from head.
