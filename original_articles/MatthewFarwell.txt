Indeed not. I'm just trying to think of something intelligent to say. MatthewFarwell

I hope you're still here, I like your phrasing in VoodooFix of '''Put the code down slowly and move away from the code''' that I think it ought to become a page on its own but I cannot decide which words to use, I'll let you or the rest of ThisWiki decide::  

 Put TheCode down slowly and move away from TheCode
 PutTheCodeDown slowly and move away from TheCode
 PutTheCodeDown slowly and MoveAwayFromTheCode
endless varieties can amuse and enlighten ThisWiki.  It's your call for now.  --ChrisGarrod
