[Part of the NegotiatingPatternLanguage]

Sometimes, the best conclusion to a negotiation is for a deal not to be made.  If the parties cannot find acceptable terms, or if one party negotiates in bad faith, sometimes the best thing to do is walk away.  You should always BeReadyToWalk; if you enter into a negotiation and ''aren't'' prepared to walk away; you are a DesperateParty and at a supreme disadvantage.
