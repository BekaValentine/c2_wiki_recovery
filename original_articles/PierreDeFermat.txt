Most famous for FermatsLastTheorem, but also known for his "little" theorem, which says that
	 :	''a^p=a(mod p)''.
This was generalised by Euler to
	 :	''a^phi(n)=1(mod n) for (a,n)=1''
which is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem.

Work by Fermat is also said to have inspired IsaacNewton in his invention of calculus.
