PairTetrisPlaying is a new method I discovered to playing Tetris.   Compare to PairProgramming, I think you will find both differences and similarities.

We would take turns playing, each having different roles.

Under the first method of PairTetrisPlaying one person would hold the controller with their eyes closed while the other one tells them what to do by describing WHERE to move the blocks.

The second, and more difficult method, is for one player to hold the controller (with eyes closed) and the other player simply calls out which type of block appears, and occasional status reports or "good job!" encouragements.  The blind player must keep the entire contents of the pit in his or her mind.

Are there similarities to PairProgramming here?

Not that I've ever really played Tetris, but I was thinking this would lead to one player strategizing and the other manipulating the controls.
Kinda' like the navigator and driver combination used in some races.
Strategizer plans ahead and when a piece appears says "left" or "right", and maybe points to the place to put the piece.
''(Just some thoughts; I've hardly ever even played the game.  ;-)''

Funny, I've played the Colin McRae series of games (Rally racing with a navigator). After a while I learned how to listen to the navigator and come out ahead on every race. I wonder how we can relate that to software ;)
