The opposite of CppHeresy.

For example, write a post to news:comp.lang.c++ and announce you want to...

	* call main recursively
	* store NULL in a reference
	* pair new[] with delete
	* define everything in a class declaration
	* make every data member public 
	* inherit StandardTemplateLibrary containers
	* InheritStlContainersPublicly

...and observe the diameter of the new one they chew you.
