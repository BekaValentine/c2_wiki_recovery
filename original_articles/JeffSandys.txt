Jeff Sandys is a design engineer at a large aerospace company in Seattle.  I lead a design automation group that uses Lisp based ICAD.  We also use Python for glueware between large applications and cgi scripts.

I enjoyed the talk that WardCunningham gave to the Seattle Extreme Programming Group, in January. 

I am implementing ExtremeProgramming practices in my group and because we still need to deliver P+ documentation, I have set up a Wiki to do Extreme Programming documentation.  '''Has anyone else done this?'''

Thanks,
