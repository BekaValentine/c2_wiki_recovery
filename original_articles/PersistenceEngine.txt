A PersistenceEngine is closely related to an ObjectOrientedDatabase, but is more tightly bound to the execution environment than the term 'database' implies.

A PersistenceEngine allows the application developer to assume an InfiniteAmountOfTransactionalMemory.  Whether or not this is a GoodThing is a matter of debate.
