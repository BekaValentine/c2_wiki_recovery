In case you were wondering, it's pronounced "chick-sent-me-high-ee".

Aah, Hungarian orthography:

'''c''' = /ts/
'''cz''' = /ch/
'''gy''' = /dzh/
'''s''' = /sh/  you wouldn't expect this one. Think ''Franz Liszt''
'''sz''' = /s/
'''zs''' = /zh/

Not to be confused with Chris Csikszentmihalyi of MIT.
