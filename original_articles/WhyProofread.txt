WhyProofread? I'm starting this page to call attention to an ever increasing problem. I have done a lot of minor corrections here (my efforts pale compared to ElizabethWiethoff and others...) and lately some knuckle-head seems to be arbitrarily reverting pages without reading what has changed or anything. Others have restored appropriate revisions, but not all. Basically, this is a waste of everyones precious time. MinorEdit''''''s are difficult to spot at a glance and these corrections quickly get lost. (thanks to the aforementioned knuckle-head.. who could certainly use some ParkingLotTherapy!)

Personally, this type of thing, along with spam, and EditWar''''''s are the most annoying things that make me not want to participate in Wiki. Much more so than the occasional OffTopic PageOfDrivel. LifeIsShort.

So, I'm asking my fellow wikizens to do a little extra proofreading before they hit the save button. I actually don't mind fixing typos and spelling errors, but, I can't stand to do it twice on the same page. I want to read a new page and fix any errors there instead... Thanks in advance for helping! -- RonJandrasi
