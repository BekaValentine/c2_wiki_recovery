A CompoundPattern of CompositePattern, StatePattern, PrototypePattern, VisitorPattern, and CommandPattern. TooledComposite supports DirectManipulation in graphical editors. I sketch it in my September '99 PatternHatching column in CppReport. http://www.research.ibm.com/designpatterns/pubs/ph-sep99.pdf is an approximation of that article. Its follow-on, VisitorInFrameworks, discusses how to circumvent Visitor's familiar problems in frameworks.
