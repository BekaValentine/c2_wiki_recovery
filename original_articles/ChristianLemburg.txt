Currently I'm working for http://www.aixonix.com/ as a developer.

I am interested in rapid application development using scripting languages, most notably Perl, and investigating the applicability of different computer languages to everyday problems. I am only marginally involved with testing in my daily work, but nevertheless I was involved in PerlUnit.
