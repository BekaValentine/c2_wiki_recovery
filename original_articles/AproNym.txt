An apronym is an acronym which means something appropriate to what it stands for. The word comes from a portmanteau of "''a propos'' acronym". An apronym is a lot like a BackroNym; indeed, a BackroNym could be described as an ex post facto apronym. While backronyms are made from a word or acronym after the fact (e.g. BASIC), an apronym's expansion is the original intended expansion.
