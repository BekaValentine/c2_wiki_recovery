"CAL Actor Language", also called "Caltrop", is a dataflow actor language developed at the
Center for Embedded Systems Design at CalBerkeley.

After perusing the Caltrop white paper, I'm pretty convinced that Caltrop isn't an actor language. It uses the word 'actor' to describe its computational units in a manner unrelated to the use of the word 'actor' in ActorsModel. Actors in Caltrop are DataflowProgramming primitives. Caltrop is a DataflowProgramming language.

Caltrop is also an incomplete language; it leaves a great deal up to the environment, including how to handle ambiguity and all issues of concurrency. This isn't necessarily a bad thing... it means that Caltrop is a DSL for describing dataflow network configurations and could be applied in a broader spectrum of applications. But it also means you can't judge many properties of Caltrop  programs by looking at their source-code, and you have no way of specifying certain environment properties from within the language.

Nothing to do with InterCal, I suppose? ''Nothing at all.''

And nothing to do with CakewalkApplicationLanguage, a Lisp-based scripting language for CakewalkProAudio too.
