''Peter, tonight I could have a heart attack and die.  I could have a stroke.  I could be bitten by an insect and die of anaphylactic shock.  A burglar could sneak in and murder me.  My wife could lose her temper at my snoring and smother me with my pillow.  I could drown in my own drool.  There could be a fire, a tornado, a flood.  A meteor could strike the house and smash my head like a pumpkin.  I feel certain that I could fill 100 pages with ways I could die tonight.  My conclusion is, nonetheless, that I won't.  (If I do, however, please raise my estimate on YtwokUpdate to 5.) -- RonJeffries''

Okay chief, shall do. Of course you're right, there are so many calamities that can leap out at you it's foolish to look too far ahead. I only wonder if you haven't maybe got medical insurance to attend to the strokes and shocks, locks on your doors to keep out the burglars, a line of credit to soothe the homicidal wife, and maybe even a sturdy roof to keep off the meteors and meteorology ... nah, you won't be bungfoodlin' with such namby-pamby precautions when you can be out riding the rails and living YouArentGonnaNeedIt to the hilt ... :-)

''Made it through another night. Fortunately the roof took most of the damage from the meteor, and the fragments killed the burglar who was in the other room.  The noise disturbed my sleep so that I stopped snoring.''

Wow, no wonder your LoadFactor is so high. Perhaps you should think about SleepToWork. -- PeterMerel
