The Corn Palace is located in Mitchell, SouthDakota: http://www.cornpalace.org/

Although, to be fair, the original Corn Palace was in Sioux City, Iowa, built in 1887. They built a new one every year, for about 4 years, until a bad harvest forced them to stop the practice in 1891. The first CornPalace in Mitchell was built in 1892.

It's on the way to MountRushmore and WallDrug, if you're coming from the east.

Every year, they start from scratch and put a new mural, made entirely of different grains, on the outside of the Corn Palace. As you can imagine, the risk of fire is great, so the local fire department made a rule that no flammable material is allowed on the bottom 10 feet of the palace. It's just plain old brick... -- SeanOleary
