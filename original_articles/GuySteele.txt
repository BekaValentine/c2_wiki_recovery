Some generally enjoyable links:

	* The (original) Hacker's Dictionary: http://www.dourish.com/goodies/jargon.html
	* ''Growing a Language'' from OOPSLA '98, see GrowingaLanguage
	* The "Lambda Papers", http://library.readscheme.org/page1.html ; see LambdaTheUltimate
	* Programming humour by TheGreatQuux:
		* Verse (including much ComputerFilk) at http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/humor/fionavar/quux_poem
			* includes "The HACTRN", also at http://www.poppyfields.net/filks/00117.html
		* Another poem: "TELNET Song": http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1419.html . This made it into the CommunicationsOfTheAssociationForComputingMachinery.
		* The Crunchly cartoons: http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/lexicon.html
		* (TheGreatQuux'''''s output was mostly inspired by the ArtificialIntelligence/LispLanguage hacking scene of the 70s and early 80s. What could capture the distinctive spirit of the 70s more perfectly than "BBN Superlisp" to the tune of JesusChristSuperstar? :) )

''I'm aware of the above,  but how is he a polymath? (I'm not arguing, I'm just curious; he's in the polymath list on SoftwareExpertsIpersonallyRespect)'' Well, there is TheGreatQuux'''''s ''oeuvre''. I don't think GuySteele would claim to be a "serious" humorist or writer though.
