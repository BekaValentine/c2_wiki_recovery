	* '''General server/channel-finding advice''': The best way to find interesting IRC channels is to find references to them from websites.  Just search for something you're interested in along with the keyword "irc".  Alternatively, you might want to try searching for "Undernet", "DALnet", or "EFnet", which are the three major IRC networks.  The website will list both a channel name and a net/server name - just fire up your IRC client and pick "Random <Foo>net server" or the equivalent.
