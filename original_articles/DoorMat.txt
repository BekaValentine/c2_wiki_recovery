Used in the same context as PeaceMaker, the DoorMat is someone
who enables outside powers to manage the team without a
reorganization. The DoorMat accedes to demands from leadership
outside the team. A rehabilitated ScapeGoat can make a
good DoorMat if he/she desires to ingratiate himself/herself
back into the power structure.
