Topic Maps are candidate tools for SustainableKnowledge
* http://dmoz.org/Reference/Knowledge_Management/Knowledge_Representation/Topic_Maps (see OpenDirectoryProject)

Its origins predate KnowledgeManagement using ExtensibleMarkupLanguage based SemanticWeb tools, but it appear WebApplication (XMLized) are increasingly important delivery mechanism.
* A "Topic Maps Query Language" (TMQL) is available for use with TopicMaps. See http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/06/01/tmql.html
* While less high profile as RDF, there are instances where TopicMaps are being considered for deployment in mid 05. See for example http://computerworld.co.nz/news.nsf/PrintDoc/7EE88219C28145E5CC25700F0000965D?OpenDocument&pub=Computerworld

''Topic maps are a way of modelling a set of subjects; the relationships between them; and additional information about them. The topic map paradigm is described in the ISO standard ISO 13250:2002 along with an interchange syntax which uses SGML. Since the publication of the first edition of the ISO specification early in 2000, a separate consortium, http://TopicMaps.Org, have produced a version of the topic map paradigm for use in a web environment which provides an interchange syntax in XML. This XML interchange syntax, known as XTM has since been adopted by ISO and forms part of the ISO 13250 standard in its second edition.''

An introduction to TopicMaps can be seen at http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tao.html

"... a topic is an InformationObject that represents a subject"

It may even represent an object which is not directly available in electronic form for use by the information processor of the computer. A topic "Reifies" its subject, making it available for computer handling.

"There are five things we can add" (to the InformationObject called a topic):
* Names
* Resource Identification
* Relationships and Roles
* Resources can be Subjects of the topic
* Identify the SubjectIndicators for the topic

''Topicmaps.Org is an independent consortium of parties interested in developing the applicability of the Topic Maps Paradigm[1] to the World Wide Web, by leveraging the XML family of specifications as required.''

''This work includes the development of version 1.0 of an XML grammar for interchanging Web-based Topic Maps, called XML Topic Maps (XTM http://www.topicmaps.org/xtm/index.html ) Version 1.0, written by the Topicmaps.Org Authoring Group. All versions of the XTM Specification will be permanently licensed to the public.''
