''Just another day at Initech...''

[Scene: Initech parking lot. Bill drives into his special spot. (Reserved for Bill Lumbergh) He turns on the alarm for his Porsche (license plate: MY PRSHE) and walks in. Peter walks in too.]

(Cut to inside. Peter pauses at the door and slowly reaches out to touch the metal handle. It gives him a shock and he enters.)

(Cut to the cubicles. Peter goes into his. He picks up papers, turns on the computer and sits down.)

'''Nina:''' Corporate Accounts Payable, Nina speaking. Just a moment. (repeats that over and over)

(Bill comes up to Peter.)

'''Bill:''' What's up, Peter? How's it going? Uh, we have sort of a problem here. [http://www.bullshitjob.com/officespace/problemhere.wav] Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS reports. [http://www.chrisglass.com/journal/downloads/TPSreport.pdf]

'''Peter:''' Oh, yeah. I'm sorry for that. I, I forgot.

'''Bill:''' Yeah. You see, we're putting the coversheets on all TPS reports. Did you get the memo about this? [http://www.yugobernie.com/images/Humor/TPSMemo.pdf]

'''Peter:''' Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no problem. 

'''Bill:''' Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that would be great. Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo, ok?

(He walks away.)

'''Peter:''' Yeah, yeah, I've got the memo, I've got -

(He picks it up but Bill's at another cubicle.)

'''Bill:''' Hello, Phil. What's happening?

(Peter tries to read his papers, but a loud radio (news) is bothering him. He stands up and sees itï¿½s Milton.)

'''Peter:''' Milton? Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?

'''Milton:''' Uh, they said I could listen to the radio from nine to eleven at a reasonable volume. 

'''Peter:''' But, no, no, no. I know you're allowed to, I was just thinking, like a personal favor, y'know?

'''Milton:''' I, I told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while she's working, I can listen to the radio while I'm collating -

'''Peter:''' Ok.

'''Milton:''' So I don't see why -

'''Peter:''' Ok.

'''Milton:''' The radio, I can't -

'''Peter:''' Yeah! All right!

(He sits down.)

'''Milton:''' I enjoy listening to the radio at a reasonable volume from nine to eleven.

(Dom walks up.)

'''Dom:''' Hello, Peter. We need to talk about your TPS reports.

'''Peter:''' Yeah. The coversheet. I know, I know. Uh, Bill talked to me about it.

'''Dom:''' Yeah. Uh, did you get that memo? [http://homepage.mac.com/payote/TPSMemo.pdf]

'''Peter:''' Yeah. (holds it up) I got the memo. And I understand the policy. The problem is, I just forgot the one time. And I've already taken care of it so it's not a problem anymore.

(Dom nods.)

'''Dom:''' Yeah. It's just that we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS reports before they go out now. So I'd really appreciate it if you could just do that. Right. Remember to do that from now on. That'd be great.

(Dom leaves; after a few seconds, the phone rings. Peter picks up the handset.)

'''Peter:''' Hello?

(brief pause)

'''Peter:''' Yes, I got the memo.
