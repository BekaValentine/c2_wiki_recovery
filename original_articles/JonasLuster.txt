I am a geek turned manager over the lack of clueful managers at my last company. Since then I moved on but never got rid of that managerial smell that seems to attract HR persons and repell fellow geeks.

You can find more about me on my Advogato page or on my Homepage.

And here's the flame-war section:

	* (X)Emacs rules, VIM sucks
	* FreeBSD rules, Linux rules a tiny bit, Windows sucks
	* Tarot is not goth, crossbow shooting is
	* Whiskey sucks, Snakebite rules
