August 16th 1995 was the first time I visited the Wiki Portland Patterns pages.   

Then I was a part time consultant and full time programmer for a communications company.  I was learning database design and Synon, a popular caseTool at the time, and in the process discovered patterns in our EntityRelationshipDiagram.  Having just connected to the InterNet the December before, I fired up Lycos 1 the SearchEngine on that 2400 baud dialup and found the PortlandPatternRepository.

I went on to do straight consulting work for a year and then started with the software company Extol as a developer.  I learned a great deal from the Joseph W. Baran, my boss, one of the best and brightest for which I ever worked.  

New opportunities presented themselves and I moved on to be a SystemsAnalyst at a major real estate company bringing all of the BusinessPatterns knowledge collected over the years and have tried to apply them.

Before all this I worked for a process control manufacturer where I learned the early concepts of SixSigma based on the wisdom of Joseph M. Juran.

I live in the pocono region of Pennsylvania.
