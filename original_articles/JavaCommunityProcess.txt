	 :	The Java Community ProcessSM (JCP) program is the formalization of the open process that Sun Microsystems, Inc. has been using since 1995 to develop and revise JavaTM technology specifications in cooperation with the international Java community. The JCP fosters evolution of the Java technology in Internet time, and in an open, participative manner. 

Giga's review of JCP2.0 (As of August 2, 2000): 
	 :	To accept JCP 2.0 as a genuinely open process requires you to believe in the benevolent stewardship of one highly competitive company in determining the future of a technology critical to many of its bitterest rivals. 

	 :	''(paraphrasing now):'' Regarding Sun?s use of the word ?open? when referring to JCP: Sun is not using the term "open" in either of the widely accepted senses: that of unencumbered open source, or referring to specifications endorsed by standards bodies.

Quote by James Gosling, chief genius at Sun, describing the idea of handing over control of Java to an open standards body: 
	 :	"Madness"

Of course you should probably take a look at the process and decide for yourself what to think.

'''End of an Era'''

With James Gosling taking over what Graham Hamilton (architect of JavaCommunityProcess) has left unfinished in Nov06, Sun is moving towards OpenSource the JavaLanguage.

That will have profound impact to the future of JavaEnterpriseEdition and its various components. Time will tell whether the entire community is heading for revival, or disaster.

My guesses are Microsoft will cull the weaker players, and the solution leaders (e.g. IBM) will get stronger as a result.

Maybe we should also consider what Sun's bitterest rivals are offering by way of community participation in development.
