Sources for algorithms abound. Some places to start:

* "Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures" provides brief descriptions of algorithms - http://www.nist.gov/dads/

* The grandaddy is, of course, Knuth's TheArtOfComputerProgramming. If you don't have a copy yourself, you can probably find it in a nearby university library when you need to look something up.

* Your search engine of choice will also find a number of hits for any common algorithm.

* The source code to Open Source languages and libraries provide field-tested algorithm implementations. For instance, the source to the Python interpreter includes implementations of hundreds of useful algorithms, many of them written in both Python and C.

* http://citeseer.nj.nec.com collects academic papers. If you're interested in detailed evaluations of advanced or obscure algorithms, it's a wonderful resource.
