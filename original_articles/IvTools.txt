IvTools is a Software Elephant that can be many things to many people depending on what part of the body they grab:

	* It's an evolving collection of vector-graphic tools for educational, scientific, and pre-production use.

	* It's a GUI toolkit based on the original lightweight glyphs of InterViews.

	* It's a LayeredApplicationFramework for custom DirectManipulation applications based on the UnidrawFramework, as well as a ComponentFramework as defined by PhilipEskelin, et.al..  (see http://www.ivtools.org/ivtools/ivtools-layers.html).

	* It has a ScriptingLanguage with a simple-as-you-can-get parenthesis-based syntax and innovative constructs for dataflow expressions and drawing editor control.

	* Augment with DougSchmidt's ACE toolkit, and it's a DistributedComponentEnvironment for developing hybrid viewer/server applications.

	* Augment with MarkLinton's Fresco (see FrescoFramework) toolkit (future possibility), and it's a cross-platform GUI toolkit with unique vector-graphic capability.

	* It might be a good starting point for the infinite canvas of ReinventingComics.  Or a graphics-oriented white-board conferencing system.  Or a ... (add your idea here).

	* It's a HyperStructuredGraphics environment ala Tgif.

	* It's a museum piece of FreeSoftware DesignPatterns, a trove of prior-art stretching back to 1986 for convenient patent immunity.

	* It supports the IplPackage.
