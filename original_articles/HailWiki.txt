''Hail Wiki, full of grace, and also full of ThreadMode crap...''

A HailWiki is a cleansing ritual you should undertake as a WikiPenance for uglifying WikiWikiWeb. It should consist of a few tiny chunks of WikiGnome work. If as many people take HailWiki penances as despoil Wiki, the site will eventually be much better for it. Not that I expect that to happen.

Do this in addition to, not as a replacement for, the advice in FixYourWiki.
