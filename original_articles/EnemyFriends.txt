EnemyFriends are people who hate each other but like each other. Clashes must exist on Earth in order for Earth to be possible. 

EnemyFriends tend to Argue to Agree, or Agree to Argue, but agree that neither should agree. 

EnemyFriends are recursive. They even end up cursing, over and over again (recursing, hehe).

To EnemyFriends, the word "agree" is just an obvious misspelling of the correct word "argue".
