I am a computer programmer from Florida who has just rediscovered the world of interactive fiction. I'm trying my hand at creating a beginner's guide to Inform. Since I'm learning the language, too, I figure it'll give me a good beginner's perspective on things.
I'm also a stickler (read: anal retentive) for spelling and grammar, so I spruced up the main page a bit. My Inform guide will be posted on the Web at http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Heights/8200/informguide.htm
You may e-mail me at mailto:pawprint@geocities.com or reach me in the newsgroup news:rec.arts.int-fiction.

Well, don't forget we're here due to the good graces of the Patterns people--this area was originally set up at InteractiveFictionPatterns to explore the idea of patterns from an InteractiveFiction perspective.  I made the InteractiveFictionInformTips page because, although not truly a pattern per se, it has a lot of the same philosophy behind it--many people converging on a problem from all sides, trying to make sense of it.  --LucianSmith
