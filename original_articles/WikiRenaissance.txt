Evidently the WikiMeme is spreading explosively now. What's interesting is that that meme invariably comes with links back to WardsWiki. Messy and primitive as it is, this place has enormous power. Old growth in the silicon forest indeed.

Now we're seeing quite a few readers and writers deriving not from contacts of Ward's or the OnTopic community, but from WikiDom as its own universe. RecentChanges is picking up and most of the old problems in this place seem to be, if not under control, at least relatively quiescent.

VideoWiki may extend wiki's reach still further. When Paris Hilton drops in to edit her homepage, we'll know we're in deep trouble.
