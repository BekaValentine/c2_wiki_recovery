For use on SharpZaurus (PortableLinux/Java/Qtopia pda):

* Zwiki - (not to be confused with ZwiKi) - real, solid Wiki - run thru Opera - based on Perl - have used extensively, and is flawless so far - quite customizable (on an actual Settings wiki page, and thru a foundational template.html, where colors, headers, footers, etc, can be modified)

	 :	''The ZaurusSoftwareIndex links for Zwiki (http://community.zaurus.com/projects/zwiki/, http://community.zaurus.com/download.php/485/zwiki_1.0_all.ipk) are currently dead. Is the package still being maintained somewhere?'' (2005/5/9) -- DavidMeyer

	 :	''I'm also looking for up-to-date info on Zaurus Wiki's specifically for the C1000/3000/3100 class.''

* KonSole - (first mandatory download :) - get out to the shell from Qtopia (windowing environment) - allows multiple tab-windows, for a nice visual 'screen'
* PortaBase - quick data storage and form creator - very customizable
* ProZect - best hierarchical outliner - open-source (like most zaurus software) - uses extended EmacsOutlineMode - allows date and progress markup for tasks
* MinScript - with VisiScript, a very fun scripting language/environment, like C++, but virtually no learning curve - wonderful for newbie programmers, as OO is not enforced, but totally available whenever rigor is desired - said to compile directly with gcc to create actual binaries - allows calls to external libraries and linux system itself
* HancomSheet - (included with Zaurus) - solid spreadsheet application - supports formulas, sorts, names, internal links, and lots of cell formatting options
* ZStyle - total control over look and colors - even make your Zaurus look like an iMac  :)
* Unofficial Zaurus FAQ - most tricks and tips listed here
* NetHack - NuffSaid
* MonoProject - .NET on a Linux portable - world is getting weird
* SafeDee http://www.safedee.com
Most of the above and many more packages are available from the ZaurusSoftwareIndex.
