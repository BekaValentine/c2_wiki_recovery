My name is Wooil Song, from Korea, a reporter. 
Now, I am preparing a report about wiki. 

	 :	Please see WikiWikiClone. WikiWiki (this, the first, wiki) stays fairly uninterested with the hundreds of other wikis that have grown to large importance on their own. In particular, FoxWiki, Swiki, Zwiki, Twiki, PhpWiki, PikiPiki and its child MoinMoin are some rather popular wikis or wiki software. You may also want to read MeatballWiki, but that gets into technical details you may not be interested in. Then again, SoftSecurity might be worthwhile. -- ss 


I've finished my report, thank you all! :) 

Looks like your report was a success. We've received many Korean visitors recently. 

''Guess what? I am one of those Korean Bypassers. Good Lucks to ya All''

	 :	Well, I'm a little bit worried, when the article is published in the February issue of the magazine, a large number of masses would come into and test here and there, maybe some trampling around; this would lead WikiWiki to a temporal chaos. However, the magazine is not a game magazine for youngsters but a developers magazine for IT professionals - it is recognized as one of the most technical developers' magazines in Korea, so we wouldn't see the worst case, though. -- JuneKim 

It's published. :)
