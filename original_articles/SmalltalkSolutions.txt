The SIGS conference that will not die.  Every year they say that this one is the last one.  Then they do another one the next year.  That tells you something about Smalltalk programmers :)

Just saw that Smalltalk Solutions 2001 is running this week in Chicago.  Anyone attending?  What's it like?  I'm really interested in hearing a report on AlanKay's keynote "Let's win the future back!"  --StuCharlton
