Or "Le Petit Prince" if you prefer the French original. Go for the version with illustrations by the author.

There is also a very nice "multimedia" adaptation, with 3D graphics (!) made from the author's illustrations (in French). http://www.gallimard.fr/multimedia/html/PP.html

Saint Ex is one of my favorite writers. Although I never read him in French (only in English and in Polish). I first read TheLittlePrince when I was just a kid.

The other book by him that I really like and go back to every now and then is WindSandAndStars.

Did you know that he wrote "The Little Prince" while he was living in New York during WWII.

His philosophical tale Le Petit Prince is a masterpiece. It contains drawing from the author. It was brought on stage in Belgium by one of our best actors, casting a different Little Prince every night (for more than a year).

His book, "The Little Prince", contains a pearl of wisdom:
	"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly;
		what is essential is invisible to the eye."
Think about what it means not only about life in general, but about programming (e.g. debugging) in particular.
