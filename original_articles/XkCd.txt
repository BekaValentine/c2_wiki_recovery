"A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language"

''One-dimensional people with multidimensional minds''

Possibly the geekiest (http://xkcd.com/c244.html) webcomic in wide circulation. It has interesting ideas about spam prevention (http://xkcd.com/c233.html), among other things.

Another fan art: "Readers Digest" published a cartooney version of the Spirit & Endeavor missions...

...with a slightly more emotional robot going "I think I can I think I can" as it chugged up a rise.
