''If every site has its own Wiki, there will be a lot of duplication of effort. Why not have one InterWiki, as a replacement of the incomplete implementation of the hypertext idea commonly known as the WorldWideWeb?.''

Because communities have an optimum size which is not ''big''. -- DaveHarris

I anticipate that many companies would choose not to have a wiki on their website. Microsoft.com wiki would just be a defacement hoax location and operating system holy war. Various annotation tools have been created for the web, which would duplicate a little of the functionality that this page wants to see. There is annotea at the http://www.w3.org There is the Microsoft smart tags feature of IE6, which some see as an evil tool for Microsoft controlled censorship. There was Third Voice, but it was a dot com bomb, and CritLink.
