InfiniteRegress, fixpoints, MetaCircularEvaluator''''''s, and the like are rarely a problem in computational systems. They do require bootstrap to represent in a VonNeumannArchitecture, but other than that work quite easily. In many ways, InfiniteRegress is quite elegant - i.e. it's "all the way down" like the allegorical turtles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down) which allows a consistency and simplicity of thought. In practice, the implementation is only a few levels deep, simply because we stop specifying things beyond a certain depth.
