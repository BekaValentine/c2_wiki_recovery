'''Bubelen'''

BubelenProject is a system for building and maintaining bubbles. A bubble is a piece of code for testing, developing, profiling, debugging, and stress testing. Bubbles are similar to boxes which are used in box testing (sometimes also referred to as unit testing), however bubbles are not designed with the only goal being testing.

'''Indy'''

InternetDirect (Indy) is an open source internet component suite comprised of popular internet protocols written in Delphi and based on blocking sockets. Indy is included in Delphi 6+, Kylix 1+, C++ Builder 6+ and Lazarus 1+ . Both client and server implementations are included as well as full source code and comprehensive demos. The Client components are easy to use because you write your transactions in a sequence and the servers are multithreaded.

'''IndySoap'''

IndySoap is a Open Source Library for implementing Web services using Borland Pascal Compilers. IndySoap isn't tied to Indy for transport services, though Indy based transport services are included. Now, developers around the world is trying to port it to Kylix 3 Open Edition. Public Discussion group can be found on http://groups.yahoo.com/group/indy-soap-public/
