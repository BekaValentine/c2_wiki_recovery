The ConnectedLimitedDeviceConfiguration (CLDC) is a JavaMicroEdition (J2ME) 'configuration' aimed at small networked devices such as mobile phones and less powerful PDAs. See http://java.sun.com/products/cldc/.

'Configuration' means essentially 'virtual machine specification + fundamental API set'. The CLDC (at least CLDC 1.0) has  e.g. no floating point and no reflection (the latter is why RMI can't be implemented on CLDC-based profiles like MobileInformationDeviceProfile).

J2ME 'Configurations' are not intended to be used alone, but only as the basis of J2ME 'Profiles'.
