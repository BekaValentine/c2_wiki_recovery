This is a style of modeling the mixes text and diagrams in one document
with cross-references.

Inspired by DonaldKnuth's LiterateProgramming.

Introduce(?) by Jim Arlow and Ila Neustadt, In their "Enterprise Patterns and MDA..."
published by Addison-Wesley in 2003.

Described and motivated on page 98.  There book illustrates the style and I find
it quite understandable as a result.
