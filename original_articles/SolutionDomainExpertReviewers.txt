''experienced software engineers).''

''They usually come from a local software house,''
and are often recent graduates.

What is the difference (in your mind) between a programmer and a software engineer? I consider myself the latter, whereas I think of a programmer as someone who simply cuts code and has no involvement in the analysis or design of the actual application. --KeithDerrick

Software engineers are either failed programmers or
programmers who are stuck in hopelessly unproductive
legacy settings, and need to compensate with a title
that speaks to their FormalismEnvy.

The term was first proposed (by PeterNaur, I believe) at an
early conference as an intentionally provocative term
that evoked the kind of discipline programmers might aspire
to;  it wasn't originally intended to be a serious
field of endeavor.  Some people still don't get the joke.

I'm not sure that I follow how a recent graduate can be 
an ''experienced'' programmer.  On the other hand, I 
consider myself a programmer (and think of the term 
software engineer as a synonym -- with apologies to 
those who feel otherwise as I don t mean to offend).
