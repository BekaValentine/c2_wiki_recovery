	*StoryQuotes - ''The following paragraphs are quotes from articles/books about stories. I've really gotten interested in stories since writing patterns. It seems the stories are a powerful way to transfer learning. It's amazing!''

	*SuccessesAndPatterns - ''Would some of the things you were left with automatically be the patterns and AntiPattern''''''s embedded in your stories?''

	*GlobalInvestmentBankProject - ''ONCE UPON A TIME there was an investment bank that was considered very prominent.''

	*DisciplineEnvy - ''When I stoop to analogy I pick journalism...But that's analogy. Instead we should study our own.''
'''User Stories'''
