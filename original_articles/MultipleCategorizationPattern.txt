This is a UI pattern being explored by the Haystack project at MIT (link below).  Essentially, you take an item (like a bookmark), put it in as many categories as appropriate, and you browse down through a dynamic hierarchy that at each step represents the intersection of all categories you've drilled down through.

Example:

A: Web page that contains a recipe for Mongolian Beef goes in categories: Chinese, beef recipes, dinner recipes
 
B: Web page that contains a recipe for Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs goes in categories: American, beef recipes, breakfast recipes

Drill-down A:

Step 1:

 Chinese
  Beef
  Dinner

Step 2:

 Chinese
  Beef
   Mongolian Beef

or

 Chinese
  Dinner
    Mongolian Beef

Drill-down B:

Step 1:

 Beef
  American
  Chinese

Step 2:

 Beef
  American
   Chicken Fried Steak

or

 Beef
  Chinese
   Mongolian Beef
