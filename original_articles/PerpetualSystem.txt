Describe PerpetualSystem here.

The reference is to the theory of the perpetual engine.  Such an engine would produce enough fuel simply by operating it, to continue to run indefinitely.  
A system that had such capabilities would adjust, modify and enhance itself without intervention...it would learn and respond to it's environment.  Would 
this be cool to devise or what?  (1995)

You have described the universe - look up at night and you will see how cool it was and is. It has been devised and is working.

The universe is in a unique position here: if you define time as being contained by it, then it is tautologically perpetual.  If you don't it is not at all clear that it is perpetual....

He/she probably meant the universe as we perceive it when viewed from the planet earth and where he/she is at the time. He/she was not looking at it  from a time machine or from 15 dimension space, or a math background.
He/she probably would have to look up "tautological" since it is not common usage for those who view the stars as the universe. Why confuse the issue?
