I was here! And I have noticed others noticing...

I have been reading a book Faster [ISBN: 0-679-40837-1] by JamesGleick, The author of Chaos.
It has been a very surrealistic book, but has managed to somehow bring the realities of living in a HyperActive, MultiTasking, SleepDeprived world.
Some of it's topics are the vagaries and limitations of ShortDistanceVerticalTransportation design, the silliness of humans trying to cope within the millisecond time interval, FastFood, faster information and how it slowing us all to a snails pace in terms of actual accomplishments during the 1440 minutes in a day.
Studies suggest that most modern workers may get as much as 6 hours of work done in a twelve hour "Work Day"... MAX!! That doesn't justify the overworked, self-aggrandizing work-a-holics view of life, but im my opinion points backwards in time to the forward thinkingness of ExtremeProgramming. 

Blah, blah, blah...
Is that a verb or noun? It's just mostly irritating!
