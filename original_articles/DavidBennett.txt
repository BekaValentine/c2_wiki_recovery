My name is David Bennett and I ''love'' to build software. 

My biggest ever project turned into a company called POWERflex (http://www.pfxcorp.com). It's a FourthGenerationLanguage with ObjectOriented features, a language that compiled to an intermediate language long before there was DotNet or CsharpLanguage or JavaLanguage. Those guys are clever. Designing and implementing your own ObjectOrientedLanguage is really hard. Trust me.

My fascination with DotNet turned into another company called Monash.Net, now called Readify (http://www.readify.net). We do DotNet training and consultancy. 

I also like to build companies. This is not intended as a plug. It's just what I happen to do.

I like thinking, talking, writing and doing: the philosophy of software, architecture, AbstractionAndElaboration, design (all types), GeneticProgramming, DesignByContract, UnitTest''''''ing, JoelOnSoftware. And a few other things.

I can be contacted at d.b at pfxcorp dot com.
