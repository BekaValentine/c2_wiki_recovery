Describing What Wiki Can Be here:

* I'm currently thinking about implementing a WikiWiki for managing my Archive of tarballs and the like and web-pages, in a browser-independent way;
* I can envision that not even javascript would be required on the client-side;

* I'm interested in the possibility of automatic link creation between pages and related tarballs;
** AutoDiscovery and linking of related content based significant words used;
*** "Significant" meaning that short-words (a, the, is, etc) are ignored;
* In a WikiWiki, Categories could be mapped to directories, with $Category.html or $Category.txt or $Category.wiki containing the names of "leaf" files below it and content related to those files; 
* An organized repository of opinions, perspectives, and anecdotes on given techniques/technologies/tools.

----
Limitations:
* no deleting;
* the server side code must enforce a chrooted-environment so that all links stay within the Archive/
* only pages marked as wiki can be edited;  I go back and forth on this limit...
