Let be a, b pages of Wikis A, B then:

a is a StrongPartnerPage to b iff a is a PartnerPage to b AND a has the same name as b.

Comment:

Partners are "strong partners" if they share their name, because this improves their chances of being found by Google searches and, consequently, by some of their strongly connected pages.
