Do you want to know how much money and time is wasted in the U.S. by workers using poorly designed applications? Have computers ''really'' improved our lives? This book takes a close look at how computers are failing us due to poor usability.  The cost is staggering.

The book also offers a solution (one we have all heard before, but the revolution has yet to catch on): '''UserCenteredDesign'''. -- ToddCoram

"Drat these computers. They are so annoying and so complex. I could pinch them." --Marvin the Martian

Another "technosceptic" book: SiliconSnakeOil by CliffordStoll. I found SiliconSnakeOil to be far more original and enjoyable. Perhaps this was the case because it didn't try to sound like an academic economics textbook.
Personally, I find Landauer's great conclusions about UserCenteredDesign to be a
little puny and obvious. --
