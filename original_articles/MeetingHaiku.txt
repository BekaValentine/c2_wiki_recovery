 Why am I sitting 
 In this dark conference room now? 
 Outside, the sun shines

 Another slide show 
 More details than I could want 
 My desk gathers dust

 Prove that you are smart 
 Ask more questions that show how 
 You feed your ego

 Cool winds stroke soft grass. 
 Birds sing sweet in budding trees. 
 Is this meeting done?

 Amazing talent 
 Wasted in this conference room 
 On status updates

 All our good intent 
 Lost in thick fogs of groupthink 
 Can't wait for the break

I've been writing "boring meeting haiku" for a number of years; I write them as memos in my Palm.  Here are some of my efforts, for your enjoyment.  Feel free to quote, just please give me credit...

 Time crawls, eyelids droop
 Fools trying to think out loud
 Meetings can be hell

 Communication
 We try so hard, but we fail
 Please say that again

 Clash of departments
 Hidden agenda icebergs
 Glad I'm not a boss

 Sloughing through the code
 The devil is in the details
 I want to go home

 We're off in the weeds
 Meetings multiply time waste
 Get me out of here

Note that in general I'm not this morose; these are from the depths of particularly long, boring, stupid, endless meetings.  I've actually written more upbeat haiku...  -- AndyMoore

 Ponderous framework
 Over-designed new system
 The project is doomed

 Smoking cigarettes
 Outside on the fire escape
 Is more fun than this

 This meeting is dull
 But the work is even worse
 Result: more haiku

 For my sakes I hope
 The other people in here
 Don't see my glazed eyes

I was expecting examples of sneaking Haiku's into what one says at the meeting.

Like this?
 I have a question
 I thought this was a meeting
 Where are the donuts?
----
 Snazzy Powerpoint
 Fails to enlighten or teach
 I need more coffee
