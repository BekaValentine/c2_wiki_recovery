Even if there were a single truth, not all can hear it, not all want to hear it, and so not all will hear it.  There is a limit to what one can accomplish, so it is to recognize that one cannot change all.

It depends on circumstances, effort and luck, but people can do amazing things if given the chance. You should be realistic but still try to see what your boundaries are, and expand them as far as possible. Your greatest challenge is to motivate yourself.
