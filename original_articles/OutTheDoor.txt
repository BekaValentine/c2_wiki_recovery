I've heard the phrase, "Just get it OutTheDoor", and seen the consequences so many times that it seems like a law of software that this attitude always leads to project failure.

In the past, when I was often stricken by AnalysisParalysis, my manager would eventually say, "Okay, enough of this design stuff, the deadline is next week. Let's just get it out the door." Good intentions, wrong approach. Most of my projects back then lost money, but the OutTheDoor approach didn't help any, because by then it was much too late.
