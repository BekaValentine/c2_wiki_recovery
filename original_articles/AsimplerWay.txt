By Margaret Wheatley and Myron Kellner-Rogers, ISBN: 1576750507

Drawing on new ideas on the capacity of systems for self-organisation (these 
ideas are more closely elaborated in Stuart Kaufmann's wonderful 
''At Home in the Universe'', ISBN: 0195111303), bases a philosophy of activity rooted in exploration without fear. Although I've just started reading it, I've already experienced many resonances with ExtremeProgramming which I'd like to explore here. Thanks to PeterMarks for introducing me to it, strongly recommended.
