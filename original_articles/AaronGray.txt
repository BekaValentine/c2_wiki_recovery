Programmer, software engineer and amateur computer scientist.

I am biased toward object oriented programming and have an interest in functional programming.

My main languages are C, and C++. I know 80x86 assembler, and like programming in assembler. And I knw a bit of Java, ML, and Hope.

My main interest is Meta Systems, and Languages.

I am working on my own object oriented language called SOOL, for Simple/Sophisticated Object Oriented Language, with OOF the Object Oriented Framework. And an OS I call OOOS. These are still in conception phase. I am toying with a language I call FOOL which is an object oriented unctional language.

Other areas of interest are parser and language theory.

I have probably the best collection of Linux kernel and programming links on the web :-
