Has anybody seen a serious wiki about humour? I have googled but cannot find anything interesting.
If there isn't any out there, I would like to participate in starting one! MikaelHermansson   

OK, I'll bite, what do you mean by "serious wiki" about humor? I suppose it's about writing humor or other topic. You can come by and check out my Wiki. I'd love to discuss humor, serious or otherwise:
