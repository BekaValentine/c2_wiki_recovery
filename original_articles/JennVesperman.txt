''Jenn, AreYouThere? 2005-01-30, last edit 2000-11-20''

I'm a programmer and technical writer, living in Melbourne, Australia.

I tend to keep most of my detail about myself on my home page, http://www.anthill.echidna.id.au/~jenn/.

For those who want my email, the anti-spam munged form is jenn at simegen dot com [''probably out-of-date - follow above link for a valid one'']. And some day, I've got to get around to doing that on my own home page!

(Thought for the day: you can tell the age of a person's home page by whether email addresses are anti-spam munged or not.)
