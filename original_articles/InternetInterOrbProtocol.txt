Usually known as '''IIOP'''.

In the CORBA protocol interoperability architecture, the standard 
GeneralInterOrbProtocol (GIOP) is defined by the CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture (CORBA)
specification.  
The GIOP specification consists of the following elements:

A CommonDataRepresentation (CDR) definition: CDR is a transfer
syntax that maps InterfaceDefinitionLanguage (IDL) types from their native host format into a
low-level bi-canonical representation, which supports both
little-endian and big-endian formats.  CDR-encoded messages are used
to transmit CORBA requests and server responses across a network.  All
IDL data types are marshaled using the CDR syntax into an
encapsulation, which is an octet stream that holds marshaled data.

GIOP message formats: The GIOP specification defines seven types of
messages that send requests, receive replies, locate objects, and
manage communication channels.

GIOP transport adapter: The GIOP specification describes the features
of an ORB transport protocol that can carry GIOP messages.  Such
protocols must be reliable and connection-oriented.  In addition, GIOP
defines a connection management protocol and a set of constraints for
GIOP message ordering.  CORBA defines a TCP/IP
mapping of GIOP, which is called the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol
(IIOP).
