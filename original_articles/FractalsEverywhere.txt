ISBN: 0-12-079069-6 (by Michael F Barnsley, paperback 2nd edition published in 2000, despite what Amazon says)

Probably the only really accessible book on fractals and a damn good read for anyone even slightly interested in the topic. Undergraduate math skills will come in handy in some sections.
