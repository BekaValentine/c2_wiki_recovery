'''Non Spoilers'''

Okay, that didn't suck at all:

	* The plot worked. 
	* The effects worked. 
	* There were no brats. 
	* Plush-toy characters were kept to a minimum.

''Much better than the Phantom Menace. Overall about as badly written as most movies, not as well acted as most. By humans at least. (By writing I mean dialog. The plot was slow but okay) ''

Disagree strongly about the writing. The plot was lavish and enthralling, with exquisite attention to continuity. It was the dialog that failed. Yoda's lines were especially putrid. Like a broken record he is, and even more convoluted than ever before his sentences have become.

''It was a StarWars movie. -- SunirShah''

Bad script.  Bad acting.  Decent plot.  Great visual effects.  Worth seeing.

	* I had a sudden overwhelming urge to stop selling death-sticks and reconsider my life.
	* ''This is how I'd sum it up in one sentence: It's ''all'' Jar-Jar's fault.''
	* Now that I've suffered Anakin, Jar-Jar doesn't seem so bad after all. I'm not sure if its was the script or the delivery, but some was awful.
	* DigitalCinema? Not good.
	* So, if C3PO lived with Owen and Beru at the Lars family moisture farm, why didn't Owen recognise him in Episode 4 when he bought him from the Jawas? Why didn't C3PO recognise Owen? How about R2, he has met Owen, and Beru, as well. And you might think the name Skywalker would be just a little familiar? So now the question is, does GL write something in Episode three to explain all this? ''If you're so smart, why are you reading comic books? -- HomerSimpson''
		* It was funny to see the young Beru pouring that blue drinking liquid, similar to what she serves in Ep. IV.  The failure of Owen to recognize the droids later ''could'' be explained by the fact that they are just machines, and they look like lots of other droids.  But it seems that C3PO and R2 need to have their memories wiped at some point, to explain why they express no prior knowledge of Tatooine, the farm, or the Skywalker name in Episode IV.
	* The attempts at comic relief with C3PO's constantly-detaching head were not very funny.  He is the Jar-Jar of this movie.
	* It always bothered me that Boba Fett had a comical death in Ep. VI.  It's nice that his father got a more respectable send-off.
