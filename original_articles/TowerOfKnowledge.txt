I am struggling with the following definitions:

* An expert whose knowledge/wisdom concerning a certain problem set is not shared with other team members.

* A person in whom rests a detailed and actionable collection of information that
** no other team member possesses
** other team members may know a little of this, but cannot sufficiently act on what they know

This person is also well described, as a team of one, by the TruckFactor
