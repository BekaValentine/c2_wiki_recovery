'''Request Newsgroup news:alt.wiki'''

What about creating a ''newsgroup'': news:alt.wiki. Taking together all interested wiki friends, dispersed over different wikis, we should get enough votes.

'''Motivation:''' 
	* '''Solve the WikiBackup problem''' for original contributions
		* What, you don't archive the bits you think are important? CutAndPaste is more than adequate for this. 
			* Sorry I meant Public WikiBackup -- fp
				* And that would be good because?
	* '''Allows easier organization''' of Special Interest Wiki Communities (creation, differentiation, migration and synchronization)
		* Why aren't special purpose wikis the best way to organize special interest wiki communities? 
			* Yes, but they need a place to synchronize -- fp
				* Why aren't special purpose wikis the best way to synchronize special interest wiki communities? 
	* '''Helps to source out ThreadMode''' stuff
		* ThreadMode happens. We need a wiki-based solution. MakeSignalNotNoise is the only way this is going to work.  
			* This Thread technique creates much noise. CritLink might be helpful to overcome this -- fp
				* MakeSignalNotNoise hasn't been demonstrated to create noise. In fact it hasn't been demonstrated on any scale at all. What leads you to think a non-wiki solution is required here?
	* '''Helps to relocate Offtopic stuff''' to the appropriate Special Interest Wiki
		* How on earth can usenet help this? If you need to relocate something, just go and relocate it. CutAndPaste.
			* The newsgroup is searchable by DejaNews, so there is a better chance for successful special interest calls for Wikipages -- fp
				* Wiki was once searchable by content. Regrettably (?) that's not what the title backlinks do any more. Happily page groups are so small I've seen no one complain about the difficulty of relocating anything. Have you?
	* '''Encourage valuable contributions''' of book authors, who otherwise wouldn't trust to contribute, because at least in this Wiki it is legal (though not ethical) to ''rip off signatures and afterwards cannibalize the intellectual property''.
		* Fridemar, I've been contributing here for over 2 years. In that time I've had content squelched, misappropriated, mangled, diddled and cannibalized too many times to count. I expect, encourage and enjoy that - it's part of WhyWikiWorks. If you want to publish unalterable content, just go to any mailing list or usenet and keep your stuff there. Or make a new kind of thing. Or, best of all, stick around here and play with this medium until you too learn to enjoy being cannibalized. --PeterMerel 
			* Peter help is in sight. Fortunataly there is the annotation system CritLink. This is your asked for new thing, to could reconcile the needs of all persons involved. -- fp
				* FP, you're not listening. Help ain't necessary or desirable. The whole point of wiki is collective ownership of content. Cannibalization is a necessary and thoroughly enjoyable part of that. I confess I still have to track down CritLink and understand it, but if it doesn't make deletion easy I expect it'll go the way of all thready online forums to date.
		*I HaveThisPattern, I like WikiNature the way it is, I don't understand some people's need to change it. If you're worried about having things changed from under you, WikiIsntForYou, it's like a game of tennis or UltimateFrisbee it only exists while it's happening. -- LarryPrice (signed only because it makes some people nervous if you don't)
			* Ok, let's play -- fp
				* We ''are'' playing.

'''Downside:'''

Alt.wiki will gate vast numbers of noisy, foolish, and destructive children into wiki. Can EndOfWiki be far behind?

Do you prefer another more complicated name, not easily typed in by kids?
Since a lot of Wikis can set their pointers in the newsgroup, special kid friendly wikis could serve as absorbers -- fp

''Hell yes! Accelerating EndOfWiki by gating UseNet into it really is best for the form. People will be most encouraged to start fresh with more functional (==cannibalistic) editorial policies. Sure FP, all my objections are swept away, please do gate UseNet into wiki and put the poor bugger out of its misery.''

We'd prefer an email list ourselves. We would also prefer that people find out about the list from Wiki rather than the other way around. -- PhilGoodwin, AnonymousDonor

I think you will like my annotation experiment, where Wiki people can neatly make their annotations, not putting a burden to Wikimaster''''s. Same load reduction effect as in email lists, but better readable in context. -- fp

I agree with PhilGoodwin, let's not tempt in the crazies...

CritLink is a high pitched annotation system, originally devoted to nanotechnology, but now populated by qualified people on the same level as here.

JonUdell wrote about DualModeConferencing in his book PracticalInternetGroupware. He shows how a discussion group can be maintained concurrently on an NNTP server and as a web app.

If there was a way of attaching a new thread to any wiki page, we could factor out most of the transient content into the discussion threads.
If any of the transient content is useful it can be copied into wiki.


Thank you for this interesting link -- fp
