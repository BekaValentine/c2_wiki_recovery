''"CppDoc generates HTML documentation for C++ classes, based on your source code and special comments embedded within it.  It can produce output that is very similar to the output of JavaDoc, and it supports JavaDoc tags such as @see, @return , etc.  The documentation comments are optional; if you leave them out, CppDoc will still generate a full set of documentation based on class relationships and hierarchy."''
