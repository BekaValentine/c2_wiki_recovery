From TomDeMarco's book ControllingSoftwareProjects:

	 :	If you were eating in a restaurant, and you saw a cockroach crawling up the wall, you probably wouldn't say,
		 :	"Oh look, there's ''the'' bug.  Good thing it wasn't in our food."
	 :	Rather, you'd assume that the place was infested.

''Actually, if a restaurant were software, we'd walk in expecting it was infested. Naturally, if we didn't see a roach until dessert, we'd say, "Oh look, there's ''the'' bug.  Good thing it wasn't in our food."''

A software engineer would say, "Let's move to a different table and see if it happens again."

That's not a bug, it's a dessert!
