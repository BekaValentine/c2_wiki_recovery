sed is a UNIX utility which processes a text file one line at a time.  It has RegularExpression based string manipulation, a hold buffer, and some basic flow control.  Amazing things can be done with these BearSkinsAndStoneKnives.  See http://sed.sourceforge.net/ for links to tutorials and sample scripts.
