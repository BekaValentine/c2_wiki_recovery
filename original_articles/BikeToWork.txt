PortlandOregon has a competition each September to promote commuting by bicycle:  http://www.bikecommutechallenge.com/

This is especially apropos in 2005 in light of the rising gas prices due to Hurricane Katrina.

I live in a place that would make that trip about 2 or 3 hours.

Riding a bike on our roads is taking your life in your hands.

Now, if I could get my employer to move the work site about 25 miles South, we might have something.

Oh, and get the city planners to do something like they did in Copenhagen, so that cyclists have their own piece of the roadway, separated by an actual railing.

I rode a bike to work in Copenhagen for years.  When I returned stateside, I was in the best physical shape of my life.

I once tried to ride my bike to college.

That day, I almost got splattered by a bus that stopped in my face to leave people.

I haven't left my neighborhood in bike ever since.

You shouldn't let stuff like that stop you.  The ''only'' reason I don't take the bike to work now-a-days is because of a super-tight commute schedule.  If I had the time, the 25 mile trek would be positively ''delightful'' to ride by bike.  And, it'd take me little more than an hour to get there (yes, I really do ride that fast).  I miss my bike commute.  :(  --Samuel A. Falvo II

Oh, that's because you don't know how stupid are people in Guadalajara regarding commuting behavior. Hundreds of people who can only afford a bike get run over every year. And I've seen people here jaywalking under pedestrian bridges. ''Yes, I said '''people jaywalking under pedestrian bridges.''''' -- DaNuke
