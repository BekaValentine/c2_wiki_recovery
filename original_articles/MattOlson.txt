I am a local technology consultant that owns and operates Ocean Consulting in the Portland, Oregon metro region. The home page may be found here:

I frequently attend the local PLUG meetings and have been known to attend a Perl Mongers meeting or two.

My interests are in databases, web services, model/view/controller models and Linux.
