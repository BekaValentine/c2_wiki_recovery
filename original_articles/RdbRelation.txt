An '''RdbRelation''' is a set of RdbTuple''''''s that all have the same RdbHeading.  To be an RdbRelation, the order of the RdbTuple''''''s cannot matter, and every RdbTuple must be unique.

RdbRelation <==> table.  Is this correct?  Am I missing something here?

''A relation is not a table.  A relation is a value that a table -- or more accurately, a relation variable (RelVar for short) -- can have at a given point in time.  An integer variable has a given integer value at a given point in time.  Similarly, a relvar has a given relation value at a given point in time.  Like this:''

 Variable category  Variable type                    Value example
 -----------------  -------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------
 Scalar             Integer                          3
 Scalar             String                           'Dave'
 Relvar             relation {x integer, y integer}  relation {tuple {x 1, y 2}, tuple {x 2, y 3}}
Therefore, the closest translation for "table" is to say relvar <==> table.
