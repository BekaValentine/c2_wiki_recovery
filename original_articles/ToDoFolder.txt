A space set aside where you make a sequential ordered list of the things you have T''''''oDo. 

Helpful in setting priorities and preserving your focus on the T''''''hingsWhichMatterMost. You probably need two such folders, one which is at and in your W''''''orkingSpace, and accessible only there (L''''''eaveYourWorkAtWork) and one on your H''''''omeDeskTopComputer (Or Non-Workplace Laptop). It should include both L''''''ongTermThingsToDo and the more immediate concerns as T''''''odayTodo T''''''omorrowTodo T''''''hisWeekTodo ....etc. or to simplify to a couple of T''''''hingsAtTheTopOfMyTodo T''''''hingsICanDoLater.

To be effective, this must be an active folder, and the things in it reviewed on a regular schedule. 

Included might be specific T''''''odoItems, Such as M''''''yVacationPlans, E''''''vents20040704, etc. 

This can be a part of P''''''ersonalStrategies.

''One problem is that I often think of stuff ToDo at home while I'm at work. So, I'd want both folders accessible.''

- Eh, then you make them accessible. The point is mostly to separate them, how far you take that is largely up to you, I suppose.

I fail to see what on this page differs from just saying "ToDo lists are useful, so you should keep them on your computer and use them regularly."

I.e. this page does not seem to serve any purpose.

''I think Donald's trying to explain a good way to organize the lists.''

I think it falls short.

''I found it interesting/helpful. Though it might belong on another page (it's short, currently). -- AndreasVc''

I think this subject is much covered elsewhere, and probably belongs elsewhere? See (for one example)
