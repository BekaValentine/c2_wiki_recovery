''The book is so endlessly complicated by details of reference and information, the interim legends become so much of a nuisance despite their relevance, that the very action of the story seems to be to become hopelessly bogged down and the book, eventually, unreadable. . . . The manuscript of The Left Hand of Darkness is returned herewith.''

New writers often collect stacks of rejection letters from publishers before getting their break in publishing, even those who become successful authors.

The moral:

* Not all critics are right.
** Though some of them might be.

* Those who wish to be successful in any endeavor must develop a strategy for dealing with criticism.
