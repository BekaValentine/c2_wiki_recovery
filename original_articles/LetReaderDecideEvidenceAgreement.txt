I propose an agreement be made in the "FunctionalProgramming vs. staff confusion" debates that both sides stop complaining about or demanding evidence about what typical programming staff is comfortable grokking/learning or not comfortable grokking/learning.

Neither side has solid research on staff absorbance such that continuing to debate on this staff-related evidence issue or complain about lack of formal studies on it has NOT been productive, leading to AnecdoteImpasse''''''s, and is unlikely to be productive without the presentation of formal research.

I propose we mutually agree to LetTheReaderDecide if a description of staff behavior matches a given reader's shop or not and leave it at that.

 if reader-agrees-staff-profile-X-fits-their shop then
    use advice related to profile X
 else 
    use advice related to profile Y  (or whatever profile fits best)
 end if
