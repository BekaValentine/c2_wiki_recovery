Grad student in ICS (Masters program) at U of Hawaii.

PhD in Economics from George Mason U.

I've been programming in smalltalk since 1989 (mostly not very well.) Before that, Ada, Fortran, assembly language. Currently, I do a lot of work with Java. (I'm TA for a data structures course where it is required for the assignments.) I'm currently being dragged kicking and screaming into the world of C++. Last fall, I took a software engineering course where we tried to learn to do microestimation.[1]
