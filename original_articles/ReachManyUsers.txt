This is why we really need DistributedComputing.

Getting many users to use a single system requires distribution of this system's functionality. There are several architectures you can get to that, lets try to collect them:

	* HostTerminal or StarNetwork 
-- have one strong central system and relatively dumb computers to give the users access to it. this is one of the simplest and well proven form to reach many users and may be the only one that makes sense
	* Agents ??
	* FederatedSystem ??
