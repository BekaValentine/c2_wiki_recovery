AlanKay gives lots of keynotes and has originated tons of memorable quotes. I'm not sure which is cause and which is effect, however.

* WhatIsTechnology
* SuccessfulTechnology
* AlanKayOnSmalltalk
* AlanKayOnObjects
* AlanKayOnMessaging
* "A new point of view is worth 80 IQ points"
* "The best way to predict the future is to invent it" (see PredictTheFuture)	
* "Play it grand... " his plea to programmers at his OOPSLA keynote speech
* "Make it work, make it correct, make it fast, make it cheap"
* Alan Kay originally coined the term ObjectOriented. See HeInventedTheTerm.
* AlanKay on DougEngelbart
* "Java and C++ make you think that the new ideas are like the old ones. Java is the most distressing thing to hit computing since MS-DOS."
* "I invented the term Object-Oriented and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind."

* On PerlLanguage: "...[Java]'s a pop culture. A commercial hit record for teenagers doesn't have to have any particular musical merits. I think a lot of the success of various programming languages is expeditious gap-filling. Perl is another example of filling a tiny, short-term need, and then being a real problem in the longer term." (source: http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=273&page=3)
* On LateBinding: "If you're using early-binding languages as most people do, rather than late-binding languages, then you really start getting locked in to stuff that you've already done." (source: http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=printer_friendly&pid=273&page=3)
