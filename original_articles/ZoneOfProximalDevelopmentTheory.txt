Theory
* "If the teacher gives a problem to the student that is too far above the level of possible understanding, then the student will be confused and no intellectual growth will occur.  A similar situation occurs if the problem is too far below the ZPD of the student. In this case the student will not be challenged enough and the old knowledge will stagnate."
