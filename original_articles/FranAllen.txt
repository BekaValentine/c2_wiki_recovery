Francinne Allen received the TuringAward on 20070611.

20070608 Today, she addressed the ComputerScience department at UcSd. The most astonishing thing she claimed was that the introduction of the CeeLanguage in 1973 derailed CompilerDelvelopment.

As a fellow at IBM and later at the NSA, she started first as a teacher of ForTran.

Compilers got smarter as they could understand ControlFlowGraphs and then DataFlowGraphs but DataDependacyGraphs came much later ( ~ 1990 )

I was fascinated by her recollections, especially about the StretchHarvest and what she mentioned about FredBrooks.
