Writing is one of my favorite hobbies. Though I have absolutely no illusions about any great skills or accomplishments, it remains a passion of mine that I fulfill daily. In particular, the notion of using a small phrase to solicate deeper thoughts within the reader is something I take interest in. You can call them maxims, one-liners, or whatever tickle's your fancy.

''We create the school that teaches us.''

''Live as if you have already perished, for it is with this musing that our every appearance becomes a celebration; our every mistake but a stolen grin.''

''Once you get going in the correct direction, shut everything off and watch a chess match on television.''

''There is only one direction: Forwards -- that is, unless you are facing the wrong way.''

 "Said before the Mirror:
  'The Human who stands before you represents potential.
   The Man who stands before you has failed.
   That being said, recognizing failure is potential.
   What are you doing, today, to become Human?'"

Feel free to comment on what has been written, or add a few thoughts of your own. I've never been accused of being set in my ways. Teach me, I will listen.
