George Brower has found that participating on this wiki is not a good use of his time.

* Sorry to see that change of attitude so soon. Although you find a fair number of people with ObsessiveCompulsiveDisorder here, once you learn how to manage your own responses there are good stuff here, not necessarily in the statistics field. Also there are quite a few mathematicians lounge around here (I am not).
* Your ManagementRoadMap is still much valued.
* You may also want to look into WikiPedia, if you do not already know, as an example of the success of the Wiki concept (heard it did go through lots of painful moments too).

''Not so much my own experience, but seeing the amount of hand-wringing about behavior and a few cases of ambush (snotty comments and deletes on pages I visited marked only by IP addresses in the logs). There's good stuff here, but it is like many potentially good but uncontrolled on-line resources - there are way too many externalities (that's economist speak for behaviors whose cost is born by people not directly involved in a transaction - like air and water pollution). There's enough of that stuff that's unavoidable to stick around it voluntarily - a little like wandering barefoot in a chemical dump.''

''Thanks for your kind words, though.''
