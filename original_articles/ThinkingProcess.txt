EliyahuGoldratt's ThinkingProcess refines and extends his FiveFocusingSteps for use in any organization or process. H. William Dettmer's ''Breaking the Constraints...'' is the best introduction I have seen. His ''Goldratt's Theory of Constraints...'' is an excellent reference. Both are published by ASQ's Quality Press.
