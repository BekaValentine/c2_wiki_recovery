I'm a software developer currently working in the technology department of a company in the travel industry.  We have big plans for software's role in the company, but our (soon to be) former process has ensured missed deadlines and mis-captured requirements.  For this reason, I've been working with our UI designer to come up with an Agile methodology that fits our company and takes into account usability issues.  Our efforts are discussed here: UsabilityAndAgileMethodologies
