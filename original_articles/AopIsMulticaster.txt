It's just the static binding version. Annotations are just a flat and boring MultiCaster Address space. Interceptors are just a local-address-limited version of MultiCaster Agents. AOP is just a dumbed down PublishAndSubscribe. And AOP boffins are just selling another case of OldWineInNewBottles.

Not quite: a MultiCaster architecture makes explicit the relationships between publishers and subscribers.  Publishers must explicitly announce an event; subscribers must explicitly register for events.

AOP hides those relationships.  When looking at a piece of code, there's no way of knowing what events are multicast and where those events go without looking at all the aspects of the system.  Therefore you need a lot of support from your development tools to make sense of the system.
