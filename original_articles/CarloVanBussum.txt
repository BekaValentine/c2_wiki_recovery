Carlo van Bussum is the creator of the EtcLanguage.

''Dude, as far as I can see, you haven't created anything.  If Etc isn't just a hoax, where can I download a compiler/interpreter from, or find something more enlightening than a tutorial on "transclusive folds" and "quadrant leverage"?  I mean, it's '''almost''' funny...''

I believe etc these days is included in most linux distributions. I believe it's in my debian at least.

* In fact, the Linux system is very dependent on the etc distribution.  I tried removing it and the system would no longer start!

''OK, that was pretty funny''

Born in 1969 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Now living in the US. Occasionally, I work with Larry Wall. 
Currently busy writing 'Programming Etc' for a major publisher. ''O'Really?'' Look for the book with the gryphon on the cover.

Hello world in etc:

I tried the  code shown above and it didn't work! All I got was an error message "Empty Variable X, transclusion folded at quadrant z = -1.00 Dump
0000 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 42 " Then my computer crashed, I haven't been able to use it since. And it is the only computer I have success two! -- 20040401
