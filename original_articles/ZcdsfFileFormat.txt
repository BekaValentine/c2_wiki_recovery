See AlternativesToXml. ZCDSF is data serialization format, like XML, JSON, etc.

Advantages includes:
* No reserved words.
* External encoding, rather than Unicode.
* Comments starts with # meaning that a shebang line is possible if you want it.
* Has support for macros.
* Uses delimiters instead of indentation.
* Support namespaces.
* Support references to other parts of the data; these aren't the same as making copies of the data, they are more like pointers.
* External datatype support by use of "host macros".
* Implementation in 35K (this is the size of a Windows executable including the library and a small example program, so the actual implementation is smaller).
* It is cleaner than XML.

Disadvantage:
* Numbers are limited to 64-bits.
* Some error checking is missing from the implementation.
* Implementation isn't quite completely tested.
* The format does not check the schema.
* Some people hate it.
* The computer will not understand what you mean if you try to use VT100 line drawing to enclose an object.
* It is difficult to put pictures in it.
* Less common.

[Looks questionable to me, and the stuff Donald found below is (at best) glancingly related.  I suggest it be deleted as there's no useful content.]
