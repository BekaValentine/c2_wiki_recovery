IMHO, the best Windows TextEditor on the planet. 

I second this. Man...I remember thinking that Brief for DOS was the best! I made so many cbrief macros. Whatever happened to Brief? I can never understand how people use VI or EMACS. I'm not smart enough for those editors. -- RobertDiFalco

Without reservation, the finest text/source code editor I have used in twenty-five years. I've used them all. -- MartySchrader

So...what are its killer features?
* Speed
* Programmability
* Context awareness
* Help
* Keyboard/Macro/API/Function mapping
* Windows system/application integration (gotta install it properly)
* Really smart and user adjustable colorization/fontification
* File folding (called 'Selective Display')
* Strong RegularExpression support, used in search/replace, as well as language-specific colorization/fontification/code-expansion.
* Did we mention speed?
* Oh yeah, and let's not forget speed

According to http://www.borland.com/codewright/ Borland has discontinued the development of CodeWright. Oh, well. Once perfection has been achieved...

Will there ever be anything to replace this editor?

''I've heard that SlickEdit is a reasonably-close analogue.''
Boxer is also very good.

I guess that Borland jr. is in charge of the Borland editors. Borland bought brief and killed it, then bought CodeWright and killed it. The philosophy seems to be "if something is better than ours, KILL IT" -- Erikm

''Actually, Borland supported C''''''odeWright for a number of years. When they had fully-integrated IDEs for all their premier development products they dropped CW as a separate product. Understandable, but it still sucks.''

The ZeusForWindows editor has many of those features include ''Brief'' keyboard emulation.
