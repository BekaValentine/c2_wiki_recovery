I'm a Group Manager at a large database company located in California's Bay Area.  In my spare time, I dragonboat, play ultimate frisbee, and study up on becoming a more effective manager and leader.

I have an undergraduate degree from California Institute of Technology that I rarely use anymore.  If you went to Caltech, though, you probably understand the feeling of "now that I've been through this, I can handle anything!".  Perhaps it is the rigor of the training, not the subject of the training, that makes the difference.

It's funny what you can find with Google...  didn't know I was mentioned in so many places!

Life is no fun if you don't take some risks.
