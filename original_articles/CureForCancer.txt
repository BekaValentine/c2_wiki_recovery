CureForCancer is used sarcastically to refer to a software development language and/or methodology touted as a panacea.  The epithet tends to be applied to languages that are both big and popular.  The CeeLanguage may be popular, but because it's so terse, nobody really calls it a CureForCancer --- they just resent it.  CeePlusPlus, on the other hand, can get tagged.
