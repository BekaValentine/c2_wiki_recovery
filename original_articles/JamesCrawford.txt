I am an architect doing mostly C++ work in the Telecommunications industry working at a company called Open Telecommunications (was Open Technology) in Sydney, Australia.  I am very interested in ExtremeProgramming for C++ and we have already done a trial of PairProgramming with great success and we are doing UnitTest driven development.  We still have a long way to go.

I am also interested in whether SingletonsAreEvil.
