One of many AgileProcesses. JensColdewey summarized the entire family of CrystalMethodologies with three phrases:

* IncrementalDevelopment
* Close Communication
* ReflectionWorkshop

The shift to CrystalClear (the lightest in the family and the one that in some fashion competes with XP) is just one word change:

* IncrementalDevelopment
* OsmoticCommunication
* ReflectionWorkshop

CrystalOrange is described in the book SurvivingObjectOrientedProjects, three known Crystal implementations are described in TheBookAgileSoftwareDevelopment, and CrystalClear is described in detail in the book by the same name (released  2004).
