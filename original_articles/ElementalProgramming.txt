Elemental programming is programming with awareness that one is creating. Many computer scientists do not think about writing a program as an act of creating something. They look at artists this way, but not at themselves. This is why elemental programming is  interesting.

It is a way of programming (a DevelopmentStance) that takes into account the act of creation.
