What is usually meant by the phrase "RewriteCodeFromScratch" but without the OxyMoron.

The OxyMoron comes from combining ''rewrite'' implying an existing source, and ''from scratch'' implying the opposite. As a figure of speech, RewriteCodeFromScratch highlights the waste. Underneath the rhetorical device, it means writing a new solution rather than modifying an existing one.

As an example, the ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation project was to replace many legacy payroll applications with a single new application.
