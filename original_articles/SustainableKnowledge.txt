KnowLedge should be sustainable, by opposition to DisposableInformation.

Sustainable here is to be understood like in SustainableDevelopment. In fact, the approach to Sustainable Knowledge should be similar to, and integrated in, the global quest for SustainableDevelopment.

It goes among other things through the development of tools that allow distinct but coordinated management in our IT systems of what is disposable from what is sustainable. TopicMaps are a good candidate technology.
