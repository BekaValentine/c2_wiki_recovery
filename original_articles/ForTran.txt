Contraction of Formula Translation, the original derivation of the name of FortranLanguage.  These days only ever spelled and capitalised like this by nitpicking grumpy old men, or by people looking to make a WikiName of of "Fortran" and who would rather not append the suffix "Language" to do so.

''Just like ProLog.''

The language was DesignedBy JohnBackus in 1954 and released on 1957-04-15. It had a big influence on the "Algol style" that most languages use these days.
