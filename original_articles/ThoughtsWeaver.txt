ThoughtsWeaver is an attempt to reproduce WikiWikiWeb
functionality for a collaborative AT&T
architecture project.  JimCoplien found out
he could put together most of the basic functionality
in a single day using pretty standard Shell scripts
and simple C++ programs.

ThoughtsWeaver was designed to look like WikiWiki to
an average user, but it has some features the
author in his folly wishes were present in WikiWikiWeb.
These are described in ThoughtsWeaverAdditions.

ThoughtsWeaver installations are being used as:
	* A communication site for the deaf;
	* A NatureOfOrder research group;
	* OrgPatterns
	* Several projects at the University of Karlsruhe
	* Many other purposes--which?

I'm interested in a link to the communications site for the deaf mentioned - is this public and still around?
