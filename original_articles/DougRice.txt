My colleague [''Who?''] at work told me about Wiki yesterday.

I have been playing with guestbooks that you can process.

I am a test engineer, and want to log snippets of information, and test results, away from my desk, on the testbay computer. 

I have an eScrapbook and an application that produces tables from an upload of CSV data. You can update any row of the data in these applications, and an audit trail is kept.

My website is http://www.dougrice.plus.com 

Wiki sounds like a really useful idea for keeping track of project hot tips.
A really useful idea.

I have set up a wiki http://cgi.dougrice.plus.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl on my web site:

[The above moved from OffTopic.]

[My Guestbook idea] uses a perl script to capture guestbook form data as javascript function calls.

as the web page is loaded, the javascript functions are called and the web page is generated.
