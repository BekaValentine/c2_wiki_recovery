Marty Heyman is one of the Founders of Symas Corporation [http://www.symas.com/].
This is a new software company working on the problem of creating and managing
relationships between people (anyone) and systems (anything that needs to understand
who the people are).

Symas does not yet use ExtremeProgramming. 
A close friend, ScottKalter, pointed these pages out to me and I'm thinking about how one brings it to a team.

'''Plea'''

We're at the point that we need people who manage lots of people's relationships
to lots of systems to give us help and advice:
Systems operators, administrators, networking consultants, even harried help desk managers.
The software will be ready for real testing on Solaris, Linux, Windows NT (4.x), and
the Livingstone Radius Server on Linux next month (November). 
It will manage users and groups first and will help you collect all those accounts for
all those people and update them directly from a central (Web or Java application) screen
over TCP/IP links.

Let me know via mailto:mheyman@symas.com if you'd be interested.
