From the movie HighLander.  The HighlanderPrinciple is:

'''There can be only one!'''

Applies to many issues in SoftwareEngineering, where supporting ''n'' things (for ''n'' > 1) is difficult/impossible whereas supporting only 1 such thing is trivial.  There's even a DesignPattern for this--the SingletonPattern.
