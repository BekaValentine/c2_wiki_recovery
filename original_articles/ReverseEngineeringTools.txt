There are a few very good free tools for reverse engineering as well.  For example,
ESSModel generates excellent class diagrams from the source--and it's very fast!
ESSModel is OpenSource FreeSoftware and is available at http://www.essmodel.com/download.html 
or from the SourceForge project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/essmodel

You can also try some promising free tool for Java Reversing :
	* RTEO (Round Trip Engineering Objects)
It is available here : http://www.rteo.org
