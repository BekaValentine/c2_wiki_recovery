Way back in college, I read "The Tomb" by F. Paul Wilson and thought It would make halfway decent adventure/horror movie. What other books would make good movies, but haven't yet ?.

- I just googled for "repairman jack" (The central character on "The Tomb") and there are attempts to make this into a movie, but suffered a setback because of a bad script. Rumor also has it, that some un-named popular young actor wants the role.

''that is the worst rumour i have ever heard''

'''Lucifer's Hammer''', by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Special effects out the ying-yang.

The '''Cluster Command''' series (three books) by David Drake. Would make the final fleet engagement scene from "Return of the Jedi" look like a schoolyard rumble.

The biggest and baddest encounter in the forty-plus year history of Fred Saberhagen's '''Berserkers'''. My favorite is "A Teardrop Falls," but that story is a little too small for the big screen. Perhaps '''Berserker Planet''' would be a better choice.

The Forgotten Soldier, it could totally dethrone Saving Private Ryan.

Every AynRand book. Then it should be required viewing in every school at every grade. The books/movies should then be endlessly discussed on all media for the next hundred years. No one should be allowed to vote unless they can write a 100 page report on objectivism.
