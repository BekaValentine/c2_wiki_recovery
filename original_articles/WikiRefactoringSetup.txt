When you see a set of Wiki pages that should be refactored, but you don't have time, and cross link them with "see also" hoping that others will see all the similar names in RecentChanges and look into it if they are so inclined and think it is needed. Like a setup in volleyball or a pass in football - you don't get to "score" but make it easier for someone to finish it.
