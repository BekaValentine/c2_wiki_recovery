Sci Fi movies or sit-com ideas you'd like to see or write.
----------
I've been kicking around a script for an android (not Google) that is still in beta, or even alpha. The developer takes him/her out on the town to test him out, with glitches creating whacky social encounters. In addition, the developer tries to give the android the ability to do "cool" tricks or feats in order to attract women into the developer's proximity, not being so socially adept himself. Thus, it's not just testing, but also a bait engine. I suppose it would resemble Star-Man in some ways, but with a bigger side of silliness. The developer's "fixes" sometimes create new, unanticipated problems such that the movie also has a touch of Groundhog Day. A running gag is that the android has a hidden switch on his head to instantly change hair-styles. Sometimes the developer gets ticked at him and smacks him on the head, switching his hair-style. Or if he bumps into something, it switches randomly: Elvis, Don King, Balmer, mow-hawk, etc. Thus, it also has a touch of The Mask and Inspector Gadget, but not as "cartoony": it strives to be semi-plausible and focuses more on awkward social situations than "action" (which may mean it's better suited for a sit-com than a movie). A variation is that the android resembles the developer such that it gets him in direct trouble.
