Computers cost money. Transmitting information costs money. The number of bits available to humanity doubles every 18 months (MooresLaw). Ergo a stable currency can be derived by making each unit equivalent to an exponential function on a certain number of bits per year.

Questions:

* How much is a single 1950 bit worth today?
* Aren't some bits worth more than others? A bit isn't the device it's held on; it's an element of a pattern. Are the number of patterns actually exponentiating, or are they just becoming increasingly redundant - are you trying to base a currency on a FeedbackEffect?
* Shouldn't you include GoogleRank in your value metric?

... others?
