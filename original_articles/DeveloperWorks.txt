With how-to articles, tutorials, tips, downloads, and other resources dedicated to open, industry-standard technologies (e.g. Open source, XML, Web Services, Linux, Wireless, Grid, Java, etc.), as well as IBM's developer products (including offerings from WebSphere, DB2, Rational, Lotus, Tivoli, and eServer).  

developerWorks has been praised as "a developer's paradise" and "perhaps the best place to get hang of technologies such as Linux, Java, XML and even Wireless," and has won various awards, including the 2004 Jolt Product Excellence Award in the "Web Sites and Developer Networks" category.  (The IBM alphaWorks emerging technologies site won the 2003 Jolt Product Excellence Award in the same category; see http://alphaworks.ibm.com).
