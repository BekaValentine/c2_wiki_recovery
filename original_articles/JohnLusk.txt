JSP, Javascript, Java programmer investigating the use of Wiki for our internal knowledge base.  ''[Results:  chose TWiki.  -- JohnLusk, 15 Nov 2004.]''

''Update, 12 Mar 2013: Been doing .NET for the last few years.  ASP.NET and client/server (WinForms).  Yay, the Borg.''

In all probability, after today's storm of edits, I won't be back 'cause I'll just plain forget.  :)

Those really eager to contact me have a shot at doing so via john-c2-wiki somewhere in the vicinity of how-hard-can-it-be.com, especially if they put something about this wiki in the subject line, and avoid all caps and multiple exclamation marks.
