Putting your personal name on the RecentChanges page instead of your host name is now a feature of the Wiki system.
See the UserName page, which explains how to set your Wiki "user name," for display on RecentChanges.

I don't see why as part of the EditPage there isn't a textbox where we can enter our WikiUserName. If left blank, the system can simply do what it does now (i.e. put the DNS there). --DrewMarsh

''(Now we have UserName, but it too is subject to the following arguments.)''

Because you could lie. Or, more likely, you can change the tag to be a real advertisement. I, for instance, could put "BackDoorProtectionism" to red flag that some capitalist pig was writing on that page. Or whatever.

''True. How about the DNS always being there and the wiki UserName, if left blank, defaults to AnonymousCoward?'' --DrewMarsh

This isn't SlashDot and no one is being prompted to sign their name, especially so condescendingly. In fact, there's a debate over whether you should sign your name or not. You're still not immune to the blatant advertising that will go on RecentChanges which will wreck the WikiNature of it.

''I recently played a bit and changed my cookie to read DevilsAdvocate. Then I realized how stupid that was and changed it back to my domain. It's stupid for two reasons: 1. It would be frowned upon by other people; 2. I rather not live my life in the pointless hacking of Wiki, something I don't have any inclination of doing anyway other than just playing a bit. Wiki works because it has no security. Shouldn't forget that. -- your anonymous interlocutor''

RE: ''The domain on RecentChanges itself:''

Would it be possible to have a RecentChangesSignature without using EditText if you had control over reverse lookup for your IP address?

''Yes:  If you control the domain name of your host (which could be a PC), you could make your name "MyWikiName.companyname.com", for instance.''

What would the point be anyway except to advertise yourself? However, since you cannot carry a message with the advertisement, you will be doubly judged on your editing efforts. I smell smoke. I think something is back firing.

''A host name that conforms to Wiki page naming conventions will display as a link on RecentChanges.  People could click on it to see your advertisement.  This could be a good way to "take responsibility" for all your posts.''

I assume that (changing your host name) would be lost for those of us behind firewalls.

See UserName page for a reasonable alternative.

Why, when I update from home, does no domain name show?

''If reverse lookup fails, it uses an empty string. I'd almost prefer a numeric IP, but it doesn't really matter.''

See UserName page for a reasonable alternative.

My Wiki builds RecentChanges each time by looking at the page database, so RecentChanges doesn't "exist" as a page and is therefore not editable.  No edit = no problem.  

By default I  return the last fifty pages, but I plan to make this user-configurable by a parameter /servlet/changes?number=xx or something --[[Alan Francis]]
