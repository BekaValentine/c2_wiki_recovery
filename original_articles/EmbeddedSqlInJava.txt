EmbeddedSql in Java:

Oracle's JSQL tries to do EmbeddedSql for JavaLanguage.  It is horribly buggy.  I especially loved the time I gave it a ten-line anonymous PL/SQL procedure and it told me there was a missing semicolon on line 40.

It's too bad, because JSQL code is generally ''much'' shorter than the corresponding JDBC code.
