WardCunningham has been kind enough to cobble together a lil cgi program that submits the wiki page in question to Google's Translating service.

'''Usage:''' click on the link - http:translate.

'''Warning:''' 
Too much English or not enough other language seems to confound the translator. It's best to keep the page you're translating monolingual.

Clicking the EditText link on the Google Translated page has the following effects:

	* Edits the page as translated (probably not what you intend).
	* It may also remove some formatting (monospace lines get mangled, but the 'blank definition term trick' works fine). 

'''TranslateWikiExample'''

----
It's best to open the translate link in a new window as the translator may affect the browser 'back' button.
