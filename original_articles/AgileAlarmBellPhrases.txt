Per ScottAmbler's TestDrivenDevelopment survey, at http://www.ambysoft.com/surveys/tdd2008.html , only 1 in 5 projects that call themselves "Agile" actually use TDD. When you hear "Agile" these days, you have 80% odds that...

* "We use Scrum, and a Scrum of Scrums. Any team is able to vote any member off their team at any standup!" (''and our HighTurnoverRate has ''Nothing'' to do with this silly policy!'')
* "We use 'AgileSoftwareDevelopment', because we never document anything... "
* "We RefactorMercilessly, but without those silly UnitTest''''''s to slow us down... "
* "And we would use PairProgramming if we had enough resources... "
* "And you can use ContinuousIntegration into your own private CodeFork... "
* "Our ChiefSoftwareArchitect merges all the code from all the forks together once a month... " (''So we take a week "off" for the ensuing IntegrationHell'')
* "And" she or he "works at a SustainablePace... "
