Non-conforming. One word says it all. There are no rules, and then there are. Democracy? Well better than that. I am new to Wiki and should not be commenting too much about it. But whatever little I have seen of Wiki, I am an instant admirer. This is one of the greatest ideas in collaboration. Perhaps order out of disorder is the key. I have seen the wasteful exercise of writing reams of design documents then painful reviews and even more painful email exchanges, then what inevitably happens is some great idea falls through the cracks... Update to the design document does not happen, software changes form and design document is left behind in a form that resembles history of Roman empire. 
To cut the long story short. I am a convert but I am also sceptical. I am experimenting but I am also hopeful. -- NasirKhan
