Software which either:

	* Ignores the ConstQualifier in languages (such as CeePlusPlus) where it is a fundamental part of the language; or
	* Uses the ConstQualifier but frequently violates it with casts or other techniques.

A prime example is the CeeStandardLibrary, which (because it predates the ConstQualifier) is rather ConstIncorrect.


Sometimes, ConstIncorrect''''''ness is a necessary evil; because:

	* It is needed to support LogicalConst''''''ness in languages which don't provide the capability
	* To interface to code which doesn't use the ConstQualifier (see above comment about CeeStandardLibrary).
