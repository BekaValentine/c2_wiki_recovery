Confirmed "bikie" (bicyclist) who thinks the only thing good about cars is that they cause more roads to be created.

Dad of four kids (three still at home).  Assistant scoutmaster (Boy Scouts), Assistant Packmaster (Cub Scouts), Sound Technician (Large Church) - and in my spare time, I'm Chief Architect at a small company called GovernmentMicroResources.

After receiving a B.S. in Psychology (Clinical/Educational), I've been in the software world for 18 years (mostly in DOD) and have been working on OO architectures for the past six years.

Interested in patterns for BreakingLinksBetweenBusinessRulesAndDatabases.
