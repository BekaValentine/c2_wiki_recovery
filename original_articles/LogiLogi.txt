LogiLogi is a PHP-based wiki.

Its newest features are Sections and Multilanguage. Also TailPages and a Yearparser are included. Last but not least there's also a user editable MenuList, NewsPage, and a WhiteBoard for each section.

Have a look at http://www.logilogi.org to see it in action.

'''Sections means:''' A page called "'''SectioN/SomePage'''" looking like 

 ---
 WikiWord
 ---

will result in WikiWord linking to '''SectioN/WikiWord'''.  If that page does not exist however, but '''OtherSection/WikiWord''' does, it will link there automatically until a page called '''SectioN/WikiWord''' is created.

Another feature of Sections is that inside (that is in '''SectioN/''' itself or in '''Section/AnySubPage''') each Section/ will show the links that appear in a page called '''SectioN/MenuList''' as a menu at the left side of the page.

Each section also has a NewsPage, and a WhiteBoard, that are parsed into the SectioN/ page.

'''Multilanguage means:'''

If a page called '''SomePage''' exists in German but not in English, then a user will automatically see the German version, even if visiting http://en.logilogi.org.

Navigation between language-versions of pages can be done by pressing the language icons above and below each page.

'''Implementation:'''

It is implemented using an alias-table, a pages-table, and pages_LanguageCode tables for the different language-versions.

The other aspects of the implementation can be best explored by downloading and experimenting with the source-code of logilogi 0.28 plankton available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/logilogi/.

'''Future:'''

The next main item on the "to do" list for LogiLogi is the separation of the parsing and viewing-parts to allow caching of Incoming Links, Ten recentchanges, and maybe even the body of the wikipages.

For this I was thinking about using XML inside a MySQL-table, to enjoy the advantages of both. Adding and removing items for each page touched by these changes at the moment a new page is saved, or links are added to an existing one (this is some sort of object oriented approach).
