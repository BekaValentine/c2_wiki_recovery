I work as a software developer at GeneData (http://www.genedata.com/) but actually studied evolutionary biology. Seems like WikiWiki brings the core ideas of both fields together. That's probably why I like it so much.

I live in Basel, SwitzerlandCountry, which is a neat place to ride your MountainBike (among many other things).
