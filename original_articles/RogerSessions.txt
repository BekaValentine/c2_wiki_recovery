''Some people think RogerSessions is a fierce MicrosoftBigot.''

His writing is always extremely positive about Microsoft, and usually negative about everybody else. Therefore: either MicrosoftCorporation is the only worthwhile system software vendor in the world, or Roger is rather biased.

''Or maybe everyone else is incredibly biased AGAINST Microsoft and after being a fierce Corba guy for over a decade at IBM, he saw it didn't work and now writes about things he thinks does work and solves the customer's problems.''

Maybe. Probably TheTruthLiesInBetween, as usual.

This guy worked on very deep CORBA stuff. And dropped it. Look at the newsletters and you'll see that he is very open.

So what, here, we have people running EJB under NT because they don't want to be Microsoft dependent. They don't want unix in house... StupidityHasNoEnd.

Keep up, Roger.

I suspect RogerSessions' motivation for changing allegiance is based more on psychology and sociology than on technical issues. His ego doesn't seem compatible with IBM/OMG dynamics, and there are only so many bandwagons to choose from. This is the guy who brought us the obvious precursor to EntityBean''''''s, he clearly has some kind of vendetta against OODBMSes for unknown reasons, and he doesn't see anything wrong with MTS's approach of passing an oid into every method of an "object". -- RandyStafford

I know Roger personally and IMHO he has no such vendetta against *anyone*. He sincerely believes MTS/COM etc is better than Corba and that it doesn't work as advertised. This does not make him a bad person. -- sg

Oh, come on, Sam. Go read the preface and first two chapters of ObjectPersistence and then come back and tell me RogerSessions doesn't have a bias against OODBMSes. And who said anything about bad person? -- RandyStafford

Ok, I'm not going to argue about it. You seem to feel strongly.

------------------
I suspect that Roger's reasons for changing allegiance was based entirely on the almighty dollar. Microsoft has an entire department dedicated to hiring specialists from competitors which they can use to discredit their competition. Until 2 years ago, the stock options made most recruits very wealthy. I was recruited by this department myself. -- Mike Jenson (not a millionaire)
