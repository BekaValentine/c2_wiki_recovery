I am host81-157-174-164.range81-157.btcentralplus.com, or at least I was at the time.  I know nothing about Tom Robbins, but I found an unattributed quote at the bottom of BeCheerful.  Few things disturb me more than an unattributed quote.  Google revealed that the quote should be attributed to Tom Robbins, hence the above.  Expanding this page I leave to the fans of Mr. Robbins.
