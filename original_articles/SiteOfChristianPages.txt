From WikiWikiSystemNotice, November 2000:

Three weeks ago I asked RichardDrake to consider hosting a site of Christian pages seeded with a few of our own. He has accepted. I chose Richard because I knew he cared about the topic, had the technology, and understood the emotions this move might touch. Richard will be launching the site in the coming week. Please forgive any dust this move might cause.
-- WardCunningham

The site became known as WhyClublet. WikiEmigration has more general discussion of moving stuff from here to there.

I'd like RelevanceOfOccamsRazor to remain here. It's linked to by at least one XP page (ExtremeOxymoron). It's on-topic insofar as it relates DoSimpleThings to scientific thought. I'll restore it shortly unless any objections are voiced. -- LaurentBossavit

''Hmm. I'd personally prefer us to build a list of WhyClubletBorderlineCases on Wiki first. PeterMerel has already listed some other pages that he suggest should migrate the other way (http://clublet.com/c/c/why?WhyClubletInitialPages). Many of the pages already moved would have at least one reference from a page remaining on Wiki. But I accept that RelevanceOfOccamsRazor, which I created to give space for your interesting discussion with Tom K (that started on a page with "Christian" in the title), is borderline. I decided as a first cut that OccamsRazor was definitely a WikiPage but that this one, which was about the relevance of OccamsRazor to PreSuppositionalApologetics, belonged on ''why''.''

''One preliminary question is how much we want to encourage pages with the same name on the two wikis, starting with the same text but thereafter diverging. There's no law against it but ... somehow it doesn't feel quite right either. -- RichardDrake''

I guess it is a matter of scope. Each wiki has a theme, and each page must be seen in the light of this. -- OleAndersen

This is interesting, indeed. I'm proud and excited to be witnessing an instance of WikiEmigration. Okay, apparently Wikis reproduce by something outwardly akin to fission, except that genetic material isn't duplicated but "donated" from the mother cell to its child. On the other hand, as you point out, there's no reason why ''some'' genes shouldn't be duplicated.

Why not allow the usual mechanics of the Wiki to select what is duplicated and what isn't ? I expect WardsWiki will remain the focus of my interest (though I might drop in on WhyClublet once in a while to say hi). My contribution to Wiki mechanics consists of maintaining or contributing to pages that I care about; Relevance is one of those. (What it was relevant '''to''' is a contingent fact of Wiki history; the page will stand on its own with the first paragraph deleted, and I expect it will get better in the fullness of time.)

I don't expect I will be contributing to Relevance if it moves - it would be silly to follow just one page to another Wiki. On the other hand, its clone on WhyClublet might very well evolve on its own into a quite different page - if people there care about that page. -- LaurentBossavit

In the light of the recent notices posted by Ward, prayers for the soul of wiki will be read nightly until further notice.

''O wiki wiki wo!''
