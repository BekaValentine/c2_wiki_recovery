In Minneapolis. Who's going? What's to do and see? Which hotel do people stay in? Are there any XP BOF's? I know BrianMarick is giving one BOF on testing.

The BOF on testing was fun. BrianMarick asked what turned out to be one of the better InterestingQuestions "When should we retire automated tests?" Although we generated a lot of quick answers to this at the BOF, after reflection on the question it turned out to be a really deep question with lots of hidden subtleties -- PeteMcBreen

There was a JavaUnit BOF which resulted in a CodeUnitTestFirstExample. -- ErikMeade
