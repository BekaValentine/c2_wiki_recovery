When adding two WikiWord links to ZeroIsWrong I noticed that there are lots of issues revoling around 
*zero
*null
*nothing
*extreme values
*borderline cases

Obviously the extremes draw the most attention and the most disagreement. 

Examples are
* ZeroIsWrong
* WhatIsNull 
* ZeroMeansNull
* NothingIsAnything.

I think there are lots of examples, but before I tag anything with this category I ask: What do you think? Should this maybe better be called CategoryVoid? Or is the existing CategoryNull enough?
