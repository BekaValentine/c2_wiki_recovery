----
Informative, funny, a great book about the mechanics of writing. Her coverage of punctuation should be required reading for all would-be book authors. Fairly inexpensive, even (eleven dollars US, list). Highly recommended. 

I haven't read her other book, ''Words Fail Me'', ISBN 0156010879; anyone? -- PaulChisholm
