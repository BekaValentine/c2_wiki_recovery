Thank you for publishing TheUndergroundGrammarian. 
I expanded the WikiWord, because it was referred by at least two wiki pages. I think it is a valuable free online reading resource for all who want to improve their English, especially in Wiki contributions.

I didn't put a comment there yet, because I think, that you as the publisher can give a more competent introduction ;-)
