When you're releasing an open-source or off-the-shelf package, your users have a clear choice about when to upgrade. Early adopters will be on a bleeding edge version or an x.0 release. Late adopters will be several versions behind.

This choice isn't available with web sites. There is only one release version: '''CURRENT'''

* It's a BadThing(tm): you're not letting the user make a choice.
* It's a GoodThing(tm): you have to learn to add new features without adding new bugs.

Any thoughts?
