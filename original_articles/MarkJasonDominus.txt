Good morning, mjd.  How goes the war? -- ThomasColthurst

Actually, mjd didn't create this page, and as far as I know hasn't seen it. I created it, because I referred to him in a comment added to DesignPatterns, and it seemed like a logical thing to do to have a page for him, rather than describing who he was inline with that comment. But then I'm very new to wiki, and might have been violating a social norm without realizing it. If I did, my apologies. -- JohnCallender

Dominus has now seen this page. -- MarkJasonDominus
