PyGame is a set of excellent PythonLanguage modules suitable for writing games and other similar applications. Its web site is http://www.pygame.org.

It's a thin wrapper for SDL (the SimpleDirectmediaLayer), so pygame calls go almost straight to C, and are very fast. It's also very easy to use even if you don't have any familiarity with SDL or Python -- in fact, my first significant Python program heavily used Pygame, and it was a joy.
