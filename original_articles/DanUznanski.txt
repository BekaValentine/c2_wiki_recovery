Creator of the Schlockian Programming Language (which is getting a complete rewrite because, well, it needs one, it was done so shockingly wrong).

Mac User, wishing I knew enough networking to get a network hooked up so I could actually ''use'' use it.

Python developer, who actually just figured out OOP about a week and a half ago.  Yeah, so I'm new.  Oh well.

Rabid webcomic fan.  Occasional writer of fanfic.

Sufferer of ADD (or is it aspergers?  or is it OCD?  It's something, whatever it is!), and occasional bouts of depression.  Especially when I'm 1500 miles from anybody I know.

Mathematician, specializing in polyhedra, cellular automata, and parametric functions.

Banjo player.  Bad Banjo player.  Well, okay, not ''that'' bad, but bad in the sense that I haven't really gotten a chance to play in a couple months.

Trying without too much success to learn MS Access because my boss needs a database in it.
