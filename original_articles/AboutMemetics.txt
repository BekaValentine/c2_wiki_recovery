'''Memetics'''

A meme is unit of cultural information or a cultural entity which defines a cognitive-behavioral pattern

Memes perpetuate a way of thinking and can enable (or defeat) the possibility of a system. Changing the business language and stories changes what is considered possible - 
''Some things have to be believed to be seen'' (Ralph Hodgson, 1871-1962 - Poet)

'''Why Memetics'''

Memetics is important because the recognition of existing obstructive memes and the creation of new memes can facilitate insights and adaptation,
