During my 20 years developing software I've seen heavy failures and agile successes.  Since 2000 I've been learning and practicing XP.

I work at IBM where many folks have used heavier methods.  Yet our team has used XP for a year, though we rated ourselves at 72% XP.  My goal is to have an unbiased set of metrics that shows if we are doing xp, and quantifies success or failure of XP.  I've written two papers on this subject: "Turning the Knobs: A Coaching Pattern for XP through Agile Metrics", and, in conjunction with LaurieWilliams and LucasLayman at NorthCarolinaStateUniversity: "Toward an XP Evaluation Framework".

I may have met you at XP Universe (2001 Raleigh, 2002 Chicago, 2003 New Orleans), the TriangleXpUsersGroup, or the rtp software process improvement group (RtpSpin).

''hey Bill - could you perhaps add a link to your paper and any other XP-EF work with LaurieWilliams? thanks :) -- KarenSmiley''

''I would also be interested in seeing your work. Please post any replies here.''

''Just found XpEvaluationFramework, which is a good start - would still like more detail''

Karen, you might try looking again at the XpEvaluationFramework page again.  I've included a link there which you may find helpful. -- LucasLayman
