I am a new Wiki user.  I am learning about wiki for my IT class.
I would like to create a new page as a graded assignment.
The first page will be about RangerSchoolKnowledge

''Hi Steven, it's great that you want to learn about Wikis, but this Wiki is about PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in SoftwareDevelopment.  If you'd like a Wiki for other purposes, you can set up your own Wiki on a WikiFarm.''
