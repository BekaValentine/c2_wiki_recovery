It's a bit like a Cobol with database query language slapped onto it. Then over the years, many kinds of other junk added to the core language without any sort of central cohesion. Now it has perhaps thousands of keywords and a half-working implementation of Java-like OO. If you require elegance from your programming environment, avoid this thing like the plague!
