Steve (Stephen R.) Palmer was the development manager on the project in Singapore where PeterCoad first discovered the benefits of object modeling in color and JeffDeLuca first wrote down the five processes that have become known as FeatureDrivenDevelopment. 
JeffDeLuca was the project manager and PeterCoad the object modeling guru on the project.

Steve is based in the UnitedKingdom, in Exmouth, Devon to be exact, and now works for hybris (http://www.hybris.com). He still writes about modeling in color and FeatureDrivenDevelopment at his own website http://www.step-10.com
