I'm the lead developer of IvTools, an evolved repackaging of InterViews and the UnidrawFramework.  Take a look at what we accomplished by layering frameworks on top of an application foundation (LayeredApplicationFramework).  The latest development on top of IvTools is the IplPackage, a development environment for the concurrent programming language described in KarlFant's book ComputerScienceReconsidered.

I used to run Vectaport Inc. (http://www.vectaport.com) located in Redwood City, California.  Vectaport sold custom development services using C++
software frameworks. I guess I am still operating a consulting business under the same name.  If you want to read my thoughts on free software business models, etc.., take a look at my AdvoGato diary: http://www.advogato.org/person/sej.  Or for other topics: http://scottsviewport.blogspot.com. 

I also had a day job in broadcast video special effects (http://www.accom.com/products/abekas/dveous/dveous_hd-info.html). My other interests are travel, history, science, camping, and everything about animation.
