A mixture of a FreeMarket and regulatory controls, such as exists in the UnitedStates at present.

-----
I understand a MixedEconomy to be a FreeMarket where the State not only regulates but owns substantial
pieces of the national economy.  As in, nationalized industries.  Different from a CommandEconomy in that
prices are not regulated by the State and there is still freedom to contract.

If regulatory controls were enough to make a FreeMarket into a MixedEconomy, then FreeMarket can't be a
useful term (to describe actually existing national economies) because there would be no such thing.  Every
nation regulates commerce.
