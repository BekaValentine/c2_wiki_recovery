Resin is an extremely fast ApplicationServer.  It's available at http://www.caucho.com

I really like this over ApacheTomcat and others because 

* if you change a class or drop in a new library, it will automatically restart the virtual host.
* The configuration file is small with as little as one line of xml code per virtual host.
