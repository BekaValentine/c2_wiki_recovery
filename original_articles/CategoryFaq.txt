FAQs are lists of frequently asked questions and answers.  Each list usually covers one topic.

Moved from CategoryCategory:

'''Should the name be singular or plural in form? It would probably be helpful to have a wikiexpert express a preference, although the majority seem to be in singular form.'''
I think it should remain singular, since it is used to label each individual FAQ.
*the question was in regard to CategoryCategory, where it was originally posted.

The Category names, as listed, must be Wiki links or they don't lead to a category page.

I like singular.  I decode the Category tag on this page as 'This question is a FAQ'. Each member of CategoryFAQ is a FAQ, and each member of CategoryCategory is a category.  The search gives the possibly plural results of all members tagged as a FAQ.
