I came here at MarnixKlooster's suggestion.  I think that the concept of patterns could be a good way of defining some of our concepts in the IF community.

My current contributions to the InteractiveFictionPatterns pages:
	*Added example pattern about doors to InteractiveFictionPatterns (InteractiveFictionTransporter)
	*Wrote InteractiveFictionPuzzleHint (An IF pattern about how to provide hints for games)
	*Wrote InteractiveFictionGiveTheGrammar (Another pattern about prompting the player)
	*Compiled InteractiveFictionRope and InteractiveFictionRopeTips
	*Started InteractiveFictionInformTips
	*Compiled InteractiveFictionLinearityVsBreadth

My current contributions to the I-F World in general:
	*'InvisiClues' for 'So Far':  http://www.bioc.rice.edu/~lpsmith/IF/sofar.html
	*"The Edifice:  An Interactive Allegory", my entry for the 1997 InteractiveFictionContest (which came in first!  Wheee!).  Release 2 is at ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/games/infocom/edifice.z5
	*"Competition '97", a front-end 'game' that allows people to randomize and rate the 35 games from the '97 IF Competition.  You can find it at: ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/games/competition97/comp97.z5

(You'll need an interpreter to play the two .z5 games--see the FAQ at ftp://ftp.gmd.de/if-archive/games/playgame.FAQ section 6.3, Inform)
