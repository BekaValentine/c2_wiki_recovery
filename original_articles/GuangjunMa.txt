A Chinese programmer, working and living in Japan.

I am interested in investigating whether the Software Development Process can benefit from Chinese philosophy.

If you're also interested, please mail me. mailto:maguangjun@hotmail.com

I think my English is really poor (because most of my friends are better than me :-) ).

''No, it's not. ;)''

But I will do my best to improve it.
