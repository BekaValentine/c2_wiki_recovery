*  This distribution consists of several free Java libraries, for user convenience bundled under one single uniform umbrella. Namely the 
** Colt library
*** provides fundamental general-purpose data structures optimized for numerical data, such as resizable arrays, dense and sparse matrices (multi-dimensional arrays), linear algebra, associative containers and buffer management.
*** http://www.cscs.umich.edu/lab/documentation/RePastStuff/repast2.0/docs/colt/
*** http://hoschek.home.cern.ch/hoschek/colt/
** Jet library
*** contains mathematical and statistical tools for data analysis, powerful histogramming functionality, Random Number Generators and Distributions useful for (event) simulations, and more.
** JAL library
*** a partial port of the C++ Standard Template Library developed by Silicon Graphics, contains a wide range of efficiently coded general-purpose algorithms on arrays.
** RngPack library
*** contains random number generators.
** CoreJava library
*** contains C-like print formatting
** Concurrent library
*** contains standardized, efficient utility classes commonly encountered in parallel & concurrent programming
** VNI library
*** contains mathematical functions and complex numbers.

Like the JavaGenericLibrary, this is another attempt to implement CeePlusPlus ''Generic Programming'' concepts in Java. Unlike JGL, this Java implementation was actually design and implemented with the help of AlexanderStepanov who was the creator of STL by Matthew Austern. Like STL, both JAL and JGL rely heavily on ExternalIteration.

These techniques shouldn't be confused with GenericJava which brings genericity to Java with parametric polymorphism.
