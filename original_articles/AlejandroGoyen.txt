I am a Computer Science graduate student at Universidad Catolica del Uruguay (South America). I worked on my master's thesis on XP together with my research partner ArielErlijman. We were particularly interested in researching existing problems and known solutions in XP implementation. Please visit ExtremeProgrammingImplementationIssues for more information.

Alejandro, I don't know how to use the references to the egroups that are listed under the various ExtremeProgrammingImplementationIssues pages. Perhaps something like the full address would be easier to navigate. Example:
	* http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/21328
	* http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/21327
	* http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/21326
	* ...

''This sounds like a good idea, but the problem is that when you follow the thread in email form (via Digest), the message numbers are enumerated differently. There is no correlation between the message number on the web and the digest number+new msg number you receive via email. AlejandroGoyen''

Not everybody gets the digest, and there's no way to access the digests online. Not everyone subscribes, and so they would not be able to follow the digest references, though they would be able to follow the online message references.

''We are working on translating all Digest numbers to URLs. ExtremeProgrammingTestingPrivateMethods is an example. AlejandroGoyen''
