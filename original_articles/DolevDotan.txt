''Dolev, AreYouThere? OrphanPage, last edited 2004-02-12 (by someone other than Dolev)''

Welcome!

I'm Dolev Dotan, a graduate student in the Technion- Israel Institute of Technology!

My research interests are (very briefly) Semantic Web and Bioinformatics.

My homepage is in http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~dolevd - But there's noting there at the moment.

I'm planning to add more (there and here) soon...
