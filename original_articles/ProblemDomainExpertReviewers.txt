''Example of DomainKnowledge:''
''Engineers know the important relationships of the domain,''
''such as the relationship between neutron flux''
''and reactor temperature.''

''They don't care about the architecture or implementation.''

''But, of course, you must have domain knowledge.''
''And the knowledge must, and can, be formalized''
''if you are to guard against disastrously undesirable''
''consequences.''
