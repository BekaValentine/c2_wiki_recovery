I've always liked the 'making sausage' metaphors better than those scatalogical, because
most sausage is actually pretty tasty despite what goes into it. Butt here goes:

* When you gotta do it, you gotta do it
* It stinks while you're doing it  ''Sometimes it even hurts while you're doing it...''
* It stinks after you've done it
* You feel better when it's done
* Nobody, not even your aunty, wants to touch or see or even know what you've done
* Even after you flush it continues to cause a stink somewhere else

I'm sorry, but I keyed off one word in the title, and this is what came out.
(Don't recurse too deeply on that.)
