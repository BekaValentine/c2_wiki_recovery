A PoliticallyLoaded concept that there is an objective position free from PoliticalBias that is by implication morally superior in its idealistic commitment to justice. By further implication, those people intelligent enough and righteous and selfless enough to contribute to the public debate in a NonPartisan way would obviously be much better governors of the country than the current incumbents and its a shame the public is too stupid to see this rather than letting these noble spirits waste away their lives as journalists, media commentators and other self-styled OpinionFormers.
