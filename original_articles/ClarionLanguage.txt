RAD for Windows.

(not the original author) ... Clarion is one of those LanguageWithDatabase environments that began under DOS and evolved through a number of bumpy stages as its original mentor went South and new blood took over.

I watched some people churn out ad hoc applications in amazingly short time frames, but I myself never mastered it. Its insistence on OO wrappers for functionality was too opaque for my tastes. I wanted to touch the damned functions without having to establish a form first.

Clarion is a code generation RAD tool that uses "dictionaries" (db schema like description) to generate code for views, input forms, reports, etc. It supports multiple languages in addition to its own.
