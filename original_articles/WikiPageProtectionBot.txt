A type of WikiBot which attempts to protect a page (which the bot author wishes to exert editorial control over) from being deleted or modified.  

It's real simple. The bot author keeps offline a copy of the preferred contents of the page. Periodically (at a slow enough rate not to consume too much bandwidth or trip a SurgeProtector), the bot checks the page to see if it has been edited or deleted recently. If it has, the bot replaces the contents of the page with the offline copy, often performing a DoubleEdit with a second IP address to keep others from restoring the page via EditCopy. There is still WikiHistory, but restoring from WikiHistory takes longer for WikiGnome''''''s to accomplish.
