The last C program you will ever write:

   #include <stdio.h>

   main()
   {
      printf("goodbye, world\n");
   }
''If it is really your last C program, you should at least do this program right:''

   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   
   int main()
   {
      printf("goodbye, world\n");
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }
''Oh come in-)), If it is really your last C program, you should at least do this program right in C++, not C!:''

   #include <stdio>
   #include <stdlib>
   
   using namespace std;

   int main()
   {
      cout << "goodbye, world" << endl;
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
   }
''Or the last shell script you'll ever write:''

  #!/usr/bin/bash
  rm -rf /

Well, if you were really clever, you'd know why you could get away with this:

 main() { printf("Goodbye, world\n"); return 0; }
And on most systems with:

 main() { return !!printf("Goodbye, world\n"); }

No-one loves TCL

 proc suicide() {
   return [puts "Goodbye cruel world!"]
 }
----

 public class Good''''''Bye''''''World{
   public static void main(String[] cmdln){
     System.out.println("Goodbye, world");
   }
 }
----
I believe the Perl way is more authentic.

 #!/usr/bin/perl

 die( "Goodbye, world!\n" );
