Regular group meetings are in abeyance, because no-one (principally not
JamesNoble) has been organising them for a while.  The next meeting will be
advertised on this page and on the group mailing list (see  http://www.mri.mq.edu.au/~kjx/patterns/) ''[BrokenLink 2005-08-13]''.

If you're interested in Patterns and are in Sydney, we'd like to have you along. 
If you've got some time, perhaps you could help coordinate the meetings?
