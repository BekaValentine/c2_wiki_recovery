Hi,

I am a consultant with the IBM Object Technology Practice in the UK. Amongst many other things I'm interested in patterns, how to harvest them and how to make them usefully available to project teams.

Isn't it time DonOlson published his anti-patterns in a magazine (or did I miss that).

I live in Gotham near Nottingham (Batman meets Robin Hood) enjoy windsurfing and keeping fit - with two sons of 12 and 9 that is not hard.

You can contact me at: mailto:simon_horner@uk.ibm.com or +44 115 983 0102
