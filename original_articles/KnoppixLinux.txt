KnoppixLinux (http://www.knoppix.org) is a derivative of DebianGnuLinux that uses KDE Gui. It is the original LiveCdOs.

Due, in part, to the fierce KdeVsGnome WindowManager debate, a similar Linux distribution is also available with GnomeDesktopEnvironment and called GnoppixLinux.
* ''...Gnoppix had to include an extra 30 MBs of packages just for the needed KDE libs to be able to run K3B''

''Please report favorable experience of using this and LiveCdOs to overcome WindowsOperatingSystems related problems.''
* I used a Knoppix CD to boot a friends windows machine that wouldn't boot from any disk he had avaliable (Actually, he just couldn't access any hdd data). I was able to mount his windows hdd and burn a cd with important data (he had poor backups) and then he safely wiped the disk and started over.. Left him the cd. I can never seem to hang on to the knoppix cds for long...
