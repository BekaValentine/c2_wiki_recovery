Wiki for digital photography

In the old days of film the camera is king. Once you get a good camera the rest is just about taking good pictures. Today, the photography is digital and the pictures are files on a hard drive. Still, most people start off by purchasing a digital camera and no further thought is given to what to do with all those digital pictures once you've started acquiring them.

At first there isn't much to organizing photos. You can create a few folders here and there and put pictures into these folders. Once you start to accumulate several thousand or tens of thousands of photos the problems start. The next stage is to start renaming all these photos to something meaningful so as to be able to search for the photos by file name. This only works for a while until the search speed to find anything at all becomes hours per search as the time it takes to access all those photo files takes longer and longer as the number of photos grows.

It is about at this point that most users turn to a SQL Database backed photo management system like VeriPic (www.VeriPic.com). With the power of a database searches typically take less than 1 second even with over 1 million photos in the database. Browsing thumbnails is also a breeze as the system is capable of displaying any number of thumbnails that fit on your computer screen in less than 1 second each and every time. VeriPic is currently the leader in this market amongst the 6 companies that have created this kind of software. As of the end of 2007 VeriPic has a larger installed customer base than it's 5 competitors combined.

The system also has security features to ensure only those authorized to access the photos can. This is the next natural step in photography after the invention of the digital camera.
