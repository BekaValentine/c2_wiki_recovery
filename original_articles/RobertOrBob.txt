My name is Robert, but some people call me Bob. I also go by D''''''iscoSnorlax on the internet. (Some people call me certain other things too, but that's an entirely different matter.)

Originally, I was going to use my UserName here, but there was some opposition, and after carefully considering the replies to my arguments, I am now using my given name.

One of my interests is DumpsterDiving , and I plan to keep active on that page if it decides to stay here. I have a LiveJournal at http://www.livejournal.com/users/discosnorlax if anyone is interested. 

I tend to do helpful little things like find info people need, and with the features here I'll probably help by fixing any spelling errors I find, in many ways I'm like a dos tsr that just sits in the background being helpful and unobtrusive...
