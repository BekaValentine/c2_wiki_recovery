TheOtherThings are things which are to be included, as present, not delayed challenges. Procrastination is not affordable here, these are things that must be accounted for and tackled, and which require both elaboration and implementation in the immediate, the now; some of these may not be publicized, broadcast, or streamed to other than their participants or partners.
* Having as a root the phrase used in JFK's speech about going to the moon 
** ''We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do '''the other things''', not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and '''the others''', too''

* ''Sometimes in the 90-10 scenario, they represent the 10 percent left to be done which require much more than the 10 percent of resources and time originally scheduled for completion, and are often the root cause of project cost and time over-runs. ( they were fuzzy-includes whose planning and adequate-accounting-measures were not allowed to crystallize at the start of the project ) In a well-designed-non-time-critical-project, TheOtherThings must be made to approach Zero in number. In others, they must be adequately provided for, including commitment, and sufficient contingency resources and time-frames.''
