In the last century I worked with C and C++ (under Solaris) before I come to Java.
If you want to know more about me you can visit my different homepages:

* http://www.ba-stuttgart.de/~boehm/ is my homepage at the Berufs-Akademie and is the oldest one
* http://www.javatux.de/ is the actual one (for the moment)
* http://www.2xp.de/ is a little bit outdated
* http://www.agentes.de/ is not mine but here I work
