Kevin S Braunsdorf (aka KS Braunsdorf, ksb, or kayessbee) was a System Administrator at PurdueUniversity from 1986 to 1994. At that time he sponsored the Purdue Daemons, taught the Computing Center's short courses on CeeLanguage and UnixShell, and ran a Monday night technical session for topics that might be of interest to CS or EE students. His 1990 C short course is still available at Purdue on video tapes.

At one of these "Monday Night Jams" Ian Murdock got interested in X windows and started the DebianLinux Project. Other well-known pundits also got their start working for or with ksb. He was the moderator of comp.sources.reviewed, contributed the the Indian Hills C style guide and submitted patches to many common OpenSource packages.

His code still lives, his file entombing package, production installation tools, the sed calculator, and the master source system. All are available at http://www.databits.net/~ksb/. He is now the Tech Fellow for Internet Operations at FedEx Services in Colorado Springs, CO.
