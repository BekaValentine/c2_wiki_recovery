The new WikiWorld is an exciting place 
	* to collaborate on developing a collective intelligence for any purpose, including 
	* ObjectWiki, and the WikiTalk syntax, that turns 
		* semi-structured Wiki texts into first class objects on the web, while 
		* harnessing Wiki's linking capability to allow wiki objects define object language for anything on the internet, 
		* using web services to keep Wiki simple.
	* experience PhpWiki and take a load off this Wiki...
