An interface which allows the user to operate directly on the objects in the system.

Examples:  
	* Any object orientated scripting languages which can accept commands from a command prompt
	* NakedObjects

Of course, what I'm really interested in is the concept of a object based ''graphical'' user interface (such as NakedObjects)...
