A peer-reviewed journal about the internet, on the internet. http://www.firstmonday.dk

Some of the most insightful (and iconoclastic) articles include:

	* Content Is Not King (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_2/odlyzko/)
	* The AttentionEconomy And The Net (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue2_4/goldhaber/)
	* A Second Look At The Cathedral And The Bazaar (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue4_12/bezroukov/index.html)
	* Computer Architectures for Protection of Personal Informatic Property: Putting Pirates, Pigs and Rapists in Perspective (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue5_7/mann/index.html)

the last is also hysterically funny.

Maybe I'm not getting the humor, but the "Pirates, Pigs, and Rapists" essay sounds more divorced from reality and mentally disturbed than anything else.  "Second Look" is quite perceptive, though. It generated a response here: http://catb.org/~esr/writings/response-to-bezroukov.html

I found it funny because it treats a serious subject on which the author has some important insights in such a casually crude manner. The juxtaposition is strange to say the least. But I think I confused two articles by the same author. The funnier one is Computer Architectures For Personal Space: Forms-Based Reasoning in the Domain of Humanistic Intelligence (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue6_8/mann/)

If you liked Second Look, you might like (http://www.firstmonday.dk/issues/issue4_10/bezroukov/index.html) on the same topic.
