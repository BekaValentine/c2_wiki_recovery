Hi, I'm Jared White, and I'm President and Art Director of Web site and graphics design company GaelDesign ( http://www.gaeldesign.com ). I'm also the Editor-in-Chief of The Idea Basket ( http://www.theideabasket.com ), an e-zine featuring provocative news commentary, articles, editorials, and reviews related to software and interface design, the Internet, multimedia, and technology.

My other life is as a musician. I'm in the Celtic ensemble Distant Oaks ( http://www.gaeldesign.com ), and I recently guested on and co-produced an electronic music album by my brother, Shayne White ( http://www.shaynesworld.com ).
