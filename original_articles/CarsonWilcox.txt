	I was a Principal Systems Architect with Fujitsu Consulting in the
	Tampa/St. Pete area of Florida,USA.
	
        Currently I am working in the WMS(Warehouse Management Systems) group at HSN(Home Shopping Network)
        in St. Pete Florida.

        I do primarily C++ and database development(Oracle) with a lot of Unix scripting thrown in for
        good measure.

	I specialize in large scale Systems Design and Development, primarily on Unix platforms.
