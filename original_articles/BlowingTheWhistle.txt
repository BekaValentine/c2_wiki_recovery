Another strategy for escaping a bad order is to do the "Blow the whistle" thing.  One can do this by leaking, especially if there are lots of people in the know so that your leak isn't traceable.  But of course it is more up front to just go public, although this will likely put you on the unemployment line for a while.  Integrity has its price, especially in a world where it is becoming an increasingly rare commodity. --RaySchneider

''I replied, "I'm sick of getting fired for that; nowadays I'm very careful I never do it. Good luck finding a whole team like that!"'' --PhlIp
