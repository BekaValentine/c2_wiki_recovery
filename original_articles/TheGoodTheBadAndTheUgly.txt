There are ''so'' many books that talk about (or reference) Patterns coming out now.  I can't seem to buy a technical book without coming across a quote from ChristopherAlexander or a reference to the GOF DesignPatterns.

Not all of these books are good.  However, I think that it would be interesting to compile a list of all  books that have been written ''under the influence of'' Patterns. I have chosen to place these titles  in our Wiki  BookList.

Keep the list growing, and if you have a review or comment on a listed book, go ahead and put it on its wiki link.
