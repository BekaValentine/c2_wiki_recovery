Just another random hacker: 

	*Aug 21, 2013: Have been living in Las Vegas the past two years after traveling and telecommuting for over a year. Left NYC in 2010. Co-founded Vegas GiveCamp (http://vegasgivecamp.org), started the Waverous LambdaMOO open source project, and founded the Las Vegas Developers Meetup.

	*Dec 10, 2003: see my AdvoGato page http://www.advogato.org/person/wainstead/, or my home page http://www.panix.com/~swain/, or the PhpWiki project http://phpwiki.org/ if you're really interested in what I do. As of this writing I work at Fortunecity.com.

	*Oct 21, 1999: I work at New York Times Digital. We've started using WikiWikiWeb for internal documentation; first on a project to build a new content management system and now to document the company systems as a whole. So far people seem pretty enthusiastic about it. 

	*Nov 26,1999: At this stage we want to merge the two Wikis. The problem is some people are creating new pages in the wrong Wiki; pages that document the project I'm working on are winding up in the company Wiki. The product managers really love the ease of use of the WikiWikiWeb, but they are growing unhappy with the simplified markup. I was slightly disappointed with the use of the Wikis as mere document-writing tools, but adoption of any sort was preferable to no documentation!

	 :	I wrote a Perl script to try to read both DBM files into two serparate hashes, and then write them out into a new DBM file with collisions fixed and so on. However the script keeps getting an error when it tries to write to the new DBM file; it gets a -1 returned, errno 2. It complains about a particular key but I can save the page in the new Wiki through the browser; I quit in frustration a few days ago, and will have to try it again soon.

	 :	I have to give a presentation on collaborative document editing next week; I've been reading John Udell's ''Practical Internet Groupware'' (from O'Reilly) and studying up on WebDaV, Zope, and Amaya/Jigsaw. 

	* Dec 4, 1999: I have made good progress on a PHP-based Wiki, called imaginatively enough PhpWiki. See the page for info.
