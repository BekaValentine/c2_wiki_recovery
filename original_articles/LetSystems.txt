Timelets:

In the overview they use national currency as 
measurement for value.

But I think it would be mush better to use
time for this.

If I need a friend to help me for 2.5 hours,
I could just pay him  2.5 hours in timelets. 

This would also prevent inflation and make it global acceptable.
