It's information compiled/generated/created by computer.
Secondary information can be deleted and regenerated at any time.
Human input can't be secondary information because it can't be deleted and easily regenerated, so it's always PrimaryInformation.
-- AlekseyPavlichenko

''You seem to have missed a step - you haven't explained '''why''' Human Input is PrimaryInformation. Surely you need to say something more like this:''
* Secondary Information is information that is derived from other information.
* Primary Information is information that is not derived from any source, but is "given".
** No information is both primary and secondary.
** All information is either "given" or derived.
* Human information ...
** is not derived from other information.
** is "given"
* Therefore Human Input is Primary Information, not Secondary Information.

''I think this is circular reasoning. What is "given" information? as in: what does that actually mean?''

I agree, so we can say that PrimaryInformation is GivenInformation and SecondaryInformation is DerivedInformation. -- Aleksey

I never thought about "No information". -- Aleksey
