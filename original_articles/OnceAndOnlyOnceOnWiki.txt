OnceAndOnlyOnce is one of the principles of the Wiki. Once you say something, once you state your position, you don't have to state it again and again; you can just link to where you said it the first time. Even better, if someone else has said what you would say, you can just link to that. -- EdwardKiser (from OnceAndOnlyOnceIsNotJustForCode)

(from HowToWriteAndEditThreadMode)

''There sure seems to be a lot of WikiOnWiki lately and rambling discourse. For me this is just as annoying as the Christianity pages. It seems like we are rehashing pages created long ago like WikiConversation or ThreadMode. Maybe a little more OnceAndOnlyOnce is in order.''

OnceAndOnlyOnceOnWiki Haven't I seen that suggestion somewhere before?

Wiki lacks the HTML equivalent of "#". To truly factor concepts to a single topic requires a finer granularity than offered by page-per-topic. I have tried to break repetition up into individual topics, but some people did not like lots of small topics.

''See PageAnchor for a crude suggestion along the lines of "#".''
