We're doing a cross-country and cross-company project. Since I'm new in the wiki world, I wonder if it could be used as a tool for general project documentation.

''Most certainly. There are plenty of other Wikizens already doing exactly that. Take a look at some of the WikiOnWiki pages to see how to go about doing this. There's also source code from many sources for creating your own in-house wiki that you can administer for team documentation.''

I guess it is a very interesting idea!

Georges M: please create a homepage with your name; tell us more about you and please include your e-mail address; copy this onto the link bar, complete your last name (if you want) and hit return: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GeorgesM... ; there is something I'd like to ask you about your Project Manager. Thanks! -- CK.
