Contemporary ('contemporary' as opposed to Swords & Magic) fantasy novel written by NeilGaiman (http://www.neilgaiman.com).
If you're into fiction of any kind, this is well worth a read.

''Actually, I'd say it kind of defies the category of contemporary fantasy...  maybe contemporary mythological fiction?''

''Actually, to be fair I'm often dubious about the ability of genres to tell us anything meaningful, but by contrast, if you construct too specific a box (as I may have done above) you risk losing what utility the category has for organizing things...''
