ThankYou WardCunningham for 
	* inventing Wiki
	* offering your Base Wiki Engine WikiBase and 
	* hosting this WikiForum. 

Wiki is great for ''sharing knowledge and ideas''.

What about integrating ''sharing income''  into Wiki?
What about a Collaboration Service such as CoSource, AsynchronyDotCom ''(or others)'', but better organized as a Wiki''''Forum?

WebValueProducer''''''s (authors and service providers) and Web value consumers are invited to discuss and realize such a community.

Before I knew Wiki, I did some ''Public Correspondence'', directed to some conventional ecommerce service providers, striving for an optimal solution for Web author''''''s.

This MultiUseWikiPage ''extends the idea of Public Correspondence'' within a Wiki context as one of the suggested EcommerceWikiTools with potential.
