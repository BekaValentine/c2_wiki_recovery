''Java Programming with CORBA'' by GeraldBrose, AndreasVogel, and KeithDuddy

ISBN:0-471-37681-7

A good introduction to doing CORBA programming with JavaLanguage.

Unfortunately, it was written before J2EE appeared, so there is no discussion of issues related to that technology.  Still, it provides solid background material for those who want to know how the stuff works under the hood or who are not using J2EE.
