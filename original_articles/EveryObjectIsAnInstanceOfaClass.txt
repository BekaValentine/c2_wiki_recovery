An object contains its own data (instance variables), but its class holds its behaviour (methods). 
To make a new object, you ask a class to "instantiate" itself. 

In a PrototypeBasedProgramming languages, an object contains both data and behaviour. It is a SelfContainedArtifact.

''Um, actually, that's the classic definition for an "object," that is, an entity expressing both state and behavior. The behavior of one instance of a class (an object) is the same as that of another instance of the same class, but each instance remembers its own state. The fact that the behavior is the same is not reflective of where the behavior methods are stored, but of the fact that the objects are of the same class.''
