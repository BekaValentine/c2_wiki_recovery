see WindowsVista. Please change the source pages that use the old name as and when required. 

Actually, Vista server will be called Longhorn. (source: "a friend of mine who works at Dell" doesn't sound very reliable as a source)

''Wasn't this formerly called MicrosoftPalladium? Didn't they rename it because of the flak they were receiving about the integration of TCPA features, and the TCPA wanting to install FritzChip''''''s on everyone's motherboards?''

No, W''''''indowsLonghorn will optionally include Palladium (http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp).

'''Many Horns of Windows'''

''A moving target, originally set for 2004''

* The 2004 date was made outside MS, in 2002 when plans for WindowsLonghorn was unveiled. See http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/toolkit/hardware/server/0,39023873,39159143,00.htm

In early 2004 there are on and off speculation about ''Shorthorn'', which is a bridging release between WindowsXp and WindowsLonghorn.

The Planned mid 2004 release of WindowsXp SP2 with new features has not put to rest the speculation on the resurrection of ''Oasis'' (Microsoft codename) release, as WindowsLonghorn schedule is now being pushed to 2007. See http://www.microsoft-watch.com/article2/0,1995,1567732,00.asp -- dl
