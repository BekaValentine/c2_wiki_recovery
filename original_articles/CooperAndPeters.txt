Ken Cooper and Ted Peters were one of the great programming teams of Smalltalk.  They wrote the original Window Builder, which they then sold to ObjectShare.  Later they teamed up again and wrote the first real programmer's editor for Smalltalk (one that had colors, grep-like functionality, etc.).  They then developed some way-cool Java Technology and were bought out by Microsoft.  I haven't heard a thing from them since they disappeared into the maw of Redmond.
