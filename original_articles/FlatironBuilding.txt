A building that wouldn't have been possible unless some drunk idiot decided to carve Broadway diagonally from north to south (since Manhattan points north-northeast).

If you haven't been there, it's on the southwest tip of Madison Square Park and within rock-throwing distance of VeryCoolBuilding. Broadway crossing 5th Ave at 23rd Street is what made them build it that way.

There's actually quite a few of them - http://www.fortworthflatiron.com/flatiron.asp

Also, Madison Square Park is where Madison Square Gardens used to be. And the point where the picture above was taken is exactly where that huge pile of (fake) fish was filmed in ''Godzilla''. And if you've never seen or been there, 5th Ave is the road to the right of the building that points south-southwest, and Broadway is the road to the left that points directly south. Times Square is 20 blocks behind you, and Union Square is 7 blocks in front of you.
