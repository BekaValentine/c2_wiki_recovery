Exception thrown in JavaLanguage during runtime when an attempt is made to cast an object reference to an incompatible type. And - which is often forgotten - this includes cases of the ''same'' Class loaded by another ClassLoader.

ClassCastException is an UncheckedException (descended from RuntimeException) and so it need not be caught in code.

Other DynamicallyTyped ProgrammingLanguages like ObjectiveCee are nice in that you never ever have this problem.

''Sure you do; in SmalltalkLanguage it's called DoesNotUnderstand.  And it's caught later, when you attempt to invoke an operation on an object that isn't supported, rather than at the point of the cast.''
