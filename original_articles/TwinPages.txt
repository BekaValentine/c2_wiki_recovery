MeatBall has a page on TwinPages. And I created the twin here on WardsWiki, because I can only afford to participate here.

I do find at times TwinPages content on MeatBall to have complementary value, and there are also instances of superior presentation and /or content there as well.

Do people here who have MeatBall experience know what is a proper way to replicate material here that is sourced from MeatBall? Please also provide advice on a way that can be tolerated (in case the proper way is too laborious).

I would like to copy something that is related to community communications, for example.

''If it is your own material, you have the right to copy. But why copy it, when you can annotate it with a TrailFire mark or by a DiiGo annotation. The annotation allows WysiWyg input and even embedding of video objects. -- FridemarPache''

PleaseComment.

'''Update notice:'''
TwinPage is now reworked on MeatBall. 

My suggestion for representing (handmade) bidirectionally connected (in- and external) Wiki pages is, using the pseudo-icon '<->' at the bottom of the page, followed by a list of all pages that are bilinked.
If the pages have the same name, then I suggest the pseudo-icon '<=>'.

In my use of the SmallestFederatedWiki, I implement a system where alternate sites using the same tag may be noted concisely
* here is the code for Twin Pages which is placed in a SFW:
 [[Twin Pages]]<sup>[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TwinPages c2] | [http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?TwinPages mb]</sup>
** The above shows a link to the page in SFW, followed by two superscripts, one for the page on WardsWiki (c2) and the other for the page on MeatBall (mb)
* It utilizes two to four character tokens for sites (meant for wikis, but intentionally used for any sites
** For the tokens used in my personal convention, see:
*** http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FederationOfYourInternet
