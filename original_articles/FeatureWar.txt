A situation where products try to out-compete each other by adding yet more features per release. Sometimes this results in a product that is too hard or clunky to use, sometimes because it is too full of features and sometimes because the features were hastly added under feature battle pressures. I rarely see slogans such as "easier to use than X", but feature-bullet lists are common.
