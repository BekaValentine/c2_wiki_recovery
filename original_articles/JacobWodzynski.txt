Hello and welcome to Jacob Wodzy≈Ñski! 

Yupp, that's what you get when you Google my name. So I made this little page only to help you find to my real web which can be found at http://www.interrail.st That being said, it's not all I have. There's a blog at http://jacobsweb.wordpress.com as well as a Flickr account on http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacobwod/ . Hope this helps! /J
