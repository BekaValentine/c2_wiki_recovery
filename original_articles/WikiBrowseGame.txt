Question: solely through LikePages, what's the fastest that you can get to a target site from here?

Post number and route below.

	* Target 1 is CategoryCategory (3)
	* Target 2 is RecentChangesJunkie (3)
	* Target 3 is MathQuizOne (4)
	* Target 4 is RuleOfThumb (6)
	* Target 5 is AlanKay (4)
	* Target 6 is MicroCosm (6)

--------

	* Target 1 in 3 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => CategoryGame => CategoryCategory
	* Target 3 in 4 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => WikiWiki => MathWiki => MathQuizOne
''Why is MathWiki not in the LikePages of this page?''
* It doesn't share an initial word or a final word.
	* Target 2 in 4 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => WikiChange => RecentChanges => RecentChangesJunkie
	* Target 2 in 3 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => WikiJunkie => RecentChangesJunkie
	* Target 4 in 6 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => WikiWiki => WardsWiki => WardsTalkAtXpImmersionTwo => RuleOfSeventyTwo => RuleOfThumb
	* Target 5 in 4 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => WikiEngine => AlansWikiEngine => AlanKay
	* Target 6 in 6 moves -- WikiBrowseGame => WikiBrowser => RefactoringBrowser => RefactoringIteration => MicroIteration => MicroCosm

All roads lead to Wiki. Pages beginning with Wiki are inherently easier. Try doing any of these targets from AmericanCulturalAssumption and post routes below.

	* Target 2 in 5 moves -- AmericanCulturalAssumption => TheAmericanWay => TheWikiWay => WikiJunkie => RecentChangesJunkie

So you can add two to the original this way? If we want a more challenging WikiBrowseGame, see below.

Further challenges ...

	* Find the two pages whose shortest LikePages journey is longer than any other pair. Longest trek posted below wins, but anyone may dispute it by posting a shorter route. Making up page strings to try to get a long wiki trip is cheating.

	* Find the longest LikePages journey between RecentChanges and RecentEdits without visiting any page twice. (Go through every like page in the longer column, then move on. Repeat ad nauseum. Or do we require alternating between the left and right columns?)
