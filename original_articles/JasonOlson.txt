Hi, and welcome to my wiki homepage. There is not much here since I am still a wiki beginner. I am 23 years old and am from Portland, Oregon. I am a windows user/programmer. I mostly program in the ASP.NET environment with C# but am comfortable in the Windows environment also. 

Here are some quotes that express my beliefs in software:

	 :	''"It is unworthy of excellent men to lose hours like slaves in the labor of calculation which could be relegated to anyone else if machines were used."'' -- Gottfried von Leibniz

	 :	''"When you take something incredibly complex and try to wrap it in something simpler, you often just shroud the complexity. You don't actually design a truly simple system. And in some ways you make it even more complex, because now the user has to understand what was omitted that they might sometimes need. That's simplexity. So to me, simplicity has to be true, in the sense that the further down you go the simpler it gets. It shouldn't get more complicated as you delve down."'' -- Anders Hejlsberg

''Hey Jason, welcome to Wiki! Just update your homepage when you get around to it. My homepage (JohannesGijsbers) is still about as minimal as your homepage when it comes to information about myself.''
