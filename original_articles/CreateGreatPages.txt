There are lots of great pages on wiki. But most degrade over time. Most peoples' edits are horrifically poor: sloppy, ungrammatical, boring, and predictable.

We can do better. We can '''all''' do better. Ditch ThreadMode, WikiOnWiki and MeToo''''''s. Do a little research and thinking before you type. OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard, and if you can't stay OnTopic at least MakeSignalNotNoise. Polish your pages and say original things. Try to PoemWiki. Strive for UtopiaNow.
