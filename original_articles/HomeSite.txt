Homesite was written in 1996 by Nick Bradbury (a former cartoonist) because he was fed up with writing HTML pages with NotePad. He looked for some sort of HTML editor and since he found none matching his needs he wrote his own!

In 1997 Homesite was acquired by Allaire Corporation, which in turn was bought by MacroMedia in 2001 (I think!)

Homesite is a code-based HTML editor, which is preferred by people like me, who want to keep control over their pages. It's also a good choice for programmers of dynamic content (PerlLanguage, PHP, ActiveServerPages, ...) and scripters.
