Apparently a rather new tool for comparison of old versions of a page; discovered in hyperlinks in the output from NewRecentChanges.

Example: http:histDiff.cgi?page=SandBoxs&old=5&new=6&ip=61.51.173.18&time=1102731939

Rather less usefully, http:histDiff.cgi?page=SandBoxs&ip=61.51.173.18

'''History diff hack:'''

Compare '''any''' "older page version number" to '''any''' "newer page version number" (version numbers refer to versions in http://c2.com/wiki/history).

http:''''''//c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=[X]&old=[Y]&new=[Z]
 X = name of page
 Y = older version number
 Z = newer version number
Example: http://c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=NewRecentChanges&old=63&new=95
*(This breaks time, and by whom ''i.e.'': Revision 88 made 37 years ago by)
**Numbers can also be reversed: http://c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=NewRecentChanges&old=95&new=63

'''Q:''' HistDiff output seems to be eliding all numbers. Is this a bug?

'''A:''' Yes, this unlikely bug was fixed 2005/02/26.
