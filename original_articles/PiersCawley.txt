PerlLanguage Programmer, wannabe XP programmer (Never read a book that inspired me more.)

Oooh, seems like I am an XP programmer (sort of) now, I appear to have convinced management to give it a try.

I'm also writing a PerlLanguage RefactoringBrowser; something which seems to surprise people who should know better.
