Do not confuse "belief" with "wishful thinking", or "faith". Beliefs appear to be facts about reality. "Wishful thinking" is a knowing suspension of a real belief, and "faith" is only about non-real things.

Many people believe a set of things about themselves and their direct interface to reality which, taken together, contain mutual exclusions or contradictions. They can do this because they have FreeWill, and they are fuzzy - at any given point in time they are only thinking via a subset of their complete belief set.

For example:

 1 I'm the smartest person in the world.
 2 I can't explain how smart I am.

This may or may not be bad for you. Those with delusions of grandeur ''and'' and inferiority complex may then run at the mouth to compensate. I'm sure we've all seen the symptoms around...

''Humans aren't like bad Star Trek AI robots.  We can hold and consider contradictory ideas in our heads without causing our ears to smoke.  The ability to do this doesn't diminish us to holding one or the other beliefs, it can enlarge our understanding of the world and ourselves as we seek to determine if there is a resolution to the paradox.  Sometimes, scientific revolutions are founded on the resolutions of two previously contradictory observations.''
