Oh no: link more. As a medium, even compared with WikiClones, ''the'' Wiki is unusually highly linked. This gives it an interesting flavour, as discussed on the PyWiki at http://www.voght.com/cgi-bin/pywiki?GlassBeadGame

In the spirit of the GlassBeadGame, we should consider that LinksAreContent.
