I was first introduced to this wiki and the concept of wikis in 2000. Since then I have implemented other wikis and am a huge fan of the concept and the content here. 

Thanks to the GemStone folks for pointing this out and hurray for this existing in the first place...an inspiration for those of us who think this way but didn't have a place to get geared up!

Have used DolphinWikiWeb and TwikiClone...both are good. Very interested in how to organize and mine Wikis...also interested in MindMap''''''ping, ConceptMapping and capturing thought in general (modeling, art, music, process, etc.).
