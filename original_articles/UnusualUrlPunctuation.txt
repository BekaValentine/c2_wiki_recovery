The wiki translator converts anything that looks like a web
URL into a hyperlink.  Specifically, it looks for 
'''http:''',
'''ftp:''', or
'''mailto:''' followed by characters up to but not including ...

	* white-space
	* angle or square brackets
	* parenthesis
	* single or double quotes

In addition, the final character of a URL cannot be the familiar 
punctuation ...

	* period
	* comma
	* question mark

(but can be exclamation mark).
