PleaseMendQuickDiff it is so useful. May 2010 and now June 2010.

Is there some reason why QuickDiff has not been mended? It is very useful to a WikiGnome.

'''Workaround:'''
Hit EditText then EditCopy.
EditCopy shows a '''diff''' between the two versions.

''That is helpful, thank you.''

''Dittos! We're flying blind! I'm suffering from RecentChangesJunkie withdrawal!!!''

Offer to donate some money to the C2 fund.

''Ward didn't create the C2 Wiki as a profit center. The script is broken probably because Wiki has exceeded some limitation of the interpreter or whatever.''

* You mean WikiWiki is full and won't fit any more stuff? That's impossi

See WikiWikiSystemNotice for a description of the exact symptoms. It looks like one script is missing or misnamed.

Suggested temporary work-around: Place the marker "[recent]" next to any new material or changes you add. When another person makes a change, they remove the recent's and add their own. I'm also kicking around putting a date stamp in case one forgets to remove them. Example: "[recent 6/9/2010]". Search for "[recent" to find any tags.

''That will work if people are cooperating. One use of QuickDiff is to check what the previous version was of something which has been proposed for deletion, or spammed. The workaround is no use for that. QuickDiff provides a quick route to restore the old version.''

Another possibility for you junkies is to consider this diff-less interlude as an opportunity. Contemplate the WikiNow, empty your mind of the illusion of RecentChanges and the mess of ThreadMode, and bring pages into timeless DocumentMode.

''That may be a good idea for some things, but QuickDiff makes it easy to check for malicious edits to e.g. FrontPage and restore the correct version.''
