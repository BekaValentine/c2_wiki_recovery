It's a wiki client for Mac OS X. Right now, it is only a stand-alone client, but it's moving towards a full multi-user wiki.

Here's the info:
	* Full unicode support
	* Embedded database
	* WYSIWYG
	* Tree document representation.

The server is not a web server. It's being written in ErlangLanguage, and uses a binary transport format. A custom editor is used instead of a web browser to support WYSIWYG editing.

Is there a URL for this program; where to download it?

'''Tree Representation'''

A document is a tree of text, starting with the document title. Then you have the chapter titles, paragraphs, and so on.  Each title or paragraph is called a node. Any node can have multiple children and multiple parents. Since a node can have multiple parents, you can create things like categories and subsections, and do searches based on these.

One problem with this representation is that often times you want to restrict the children in a node based on what parent you linked from. Information should change based on context. Right now I think think this can be handled with a simple algorithm and the basic data structure does not need to be changed. I won't be able to test this until the implementation is finished. PeriPeri offers an interesting solution in shatter facets. (''Note to Edwin Zacharias: there's a patch to UseMod that makes it more like PeriPeri that might interest you; it's at'' http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WikiPatches/PeriPerify -- Chris Purcell [KritTer])

Another problem is that children fall into either aggregates (part of the parent) or attributes (describes the parent), and it would get messy if they were jumbled together. I'm not sure why this is, from a philosophical standpoint, so I'm going to hold off until I can play with it.
