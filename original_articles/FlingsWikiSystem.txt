Speech without limits

Fling is a new suite of internet protocols that perform the function of DNS, TCP, and UDP in a manner that's both untraceable and untappable. Fling protects clients
from servers, servers from clients, and both from an eavesdropper in-between. The result is that anyone can serve or retrieve any data, without fear of censure. 

Fling is similar to OnionRouting, but with a 180 degree flip: since the "onion" is created at the ''recipient'' end, the client side need not know the server side's IP. This means that both ends are hidden. The only downside being: a hidden recipient IP means that use as a TCP tunnel is ruled out - hosts are anonymous, identitified only by the "onion" used to contact them.
