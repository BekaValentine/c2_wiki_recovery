LeftHanded people are the only people in their right minds.

''Any famous LeftHanded programmers?  We aren't very good at math, but we are creative.  I'm worried left handers are behind the ObjectOriented craze.  I doubt they're behind the PurelyFunctional craze.''

''We aren't very good at math'' Says who? AnonymousLeftHandedMathsGraduate

I always thought there was a positive correlation between being
LeftHanded and being good at mathematics. -- GarethMcCaughan
(good at mathematics but right-handed)

Actually I thought the correlation was left-handed and dyslexic, and I believe being dyslexic makes maths difficult. --NoelWelsh (leftie and very mildly dyslexic)

I'm wrong then.  It's nice to know I'm good at math.  :)
