I am very interested in Patterns...especially
the Patterns of HumanBehavior
that keep popping up around the InterNet...
and other good cruising grounds like the BritishVirginIslands
...

The InterNet is a powerful tool for tracking these Patterns...
and helps to feed the WebOmatic PatternProcessor...
it is very similar to tracking HurricanePatterns...which, this season
was a FullTimeJob

Thanks for the interesting site...many of the Patterns of the past
few years have now become more clear as a result of
this site...the Patterns of HumanBehavior have been
disappointing, but not unexpected...

Thanks again for the "input" to the WebOmatic

P.S. there is not much grass to cut around TechnoCat
but there is still a lot of grass to cut in NaperVille
