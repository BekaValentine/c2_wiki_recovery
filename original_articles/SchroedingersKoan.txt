One day, a novice programmer came to a master programmer called Schroedinger  and showed him a program he had just written. He asked Schroedinger, "How can I make sure no bug ever turns up in my program?"

Without a word, Schroedinger took the notebook with the program from the novice's hands and threw it out of the office window.

At this moment the novice programmer became enlightened.
