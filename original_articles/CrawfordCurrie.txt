I'm a software consultant working out of Northwich, England, and specialising in groupware solutions. I've been developing in the C family, most recently in Java, for > 20 years, most of the time in the Electronics industry.

I'm also a strong contributor to the TWiki (TwikiClone) development, where I've developed a number of plugins and core patches.
