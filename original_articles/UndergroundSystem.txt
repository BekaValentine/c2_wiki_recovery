An UndergroundSystem is a system that management doesn't know about, but the developers do.

Depending on the general competence of management, varying degrees of stealth are employed to hide the existence of the UndergroundSystem. The best respected use of an UndergroundSystem is to implement by stealth necessary items for software development, e.d. well-designed VersionControl. Yes, I am of the opinion that BondageAndDisciplineVersionControl deserves to be driven scriptwise and the real VersionControl hidden somewhere else; however the more common case is there is no VersionControl because Management doesn't want to spring for it.
