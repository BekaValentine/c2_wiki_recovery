''A statement of a frame of mind and position on action/inaction. It is derived from skills, beliefs and attitudes ''DoingOutLoud.DonaldNoyes.20140730

For the unskilled, it needs to be shown to be true, since it may be questionable. For the skilled, however, its meaning is simple.

In both cases, it is an attitude arising from inner convictions and beliefs, supported or unsupported by reason. It is a common attitude, which is exercised somewhat regularly. Some use it to state an inner conviction which enables them to  do the thing. Others use it to state confidence that the doing is either possible, or "It's my job". 

The statement is also made in collective or impersonal form, as in We sure can, You sure can, They sure can, It sure can. 

It is offered to demonstrate the likelihood of an activity.

There is a certain amount of AmericanCulturalAssumption here. IsureCan seems to be much easier for Americans to say than the British. My (American) wife was quite shocked by the attitude of British Tradesmen. The typical difference can be illustrated as follows:


''In Texas, USA''

	* My Wife: "Something seems to be blocking my roof gutter, the rain comes down the wall here. Can you please take a look?"
	* Tradesman: "Yes Ma'am, I Sure Can!"
	* Tradesman clears blockage and gives large bill for the half hour visit.

''In Yorkshire, England''

	* My Wife: "Something seems to be blocking my roof gutter, the rain comes down the wall here. Can you please take a look?"
	* Tradesman makes a face as though he has sucked a lemon, slowly draws air between his teeth.
	* Tradesman: "Well, Gutters can be tricky things sometimes. I can take a look, but it could be owt or nowt up there."
	* Tradesman examines gutter, comes down.
	* Tradesman: "Well you're lucky, it's just blocked with leaves. I should have it fixed in a jiffy. Any chance of a cuppa first?"
	* My Wife (having been in England long enough to know that tradesmen run on tea): "Sure, I'll get the kettle on".
	* Tradesman drinks tea, discusses weather, the breed of sheep in the next field, where in the States my wife comes from and how his daughter visited Florida....
	* Tradesman clears blockage and gives bill so small you wonder how he makes a living when it has taken him two hours for the one job.

I've noticed a corrollary to the tradesman anecdote.  Britons, when in large groups and exposed to a long dely, have a little song that they sing: ''"Why are we waiting, Why-y are we waiting"''.  The tune is ''"O Come All Ye Faithful"''.  Possible implications:
* American organizations are so efficient that Americans are unused to delays and have no well-established methods for dealing with them.
* Americans are like dumb sheep, will take any delay foisted on them by their corporate masters, and can only devolve into disjointed rage when provoked.
* Britons just have a whackier sense of humor.
* None of the above.
