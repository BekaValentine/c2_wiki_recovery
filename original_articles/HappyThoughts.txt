I'm a little frustrated with some code that I have to fix. There are no UnitTest''''''s and no AcceptanceTest''''''s. Nobody even knows how the App was supposed to work in the first place. The code probably never worked right at all. The previous developer obviously did not understand that CopyAndPasteIsNotaDesignPattern. If I could just find the previous developer and... Arghhh...

Quick, get to your HappyPlace.

Stop and think some HappyThoughts...

Ahhhh.... much better.

Now, I can get back to doing useful, productive work.

I don't know about you, but I feel much better. Cheers, --JasonNocks
