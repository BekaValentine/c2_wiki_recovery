A '''WriteOnlyPage''' is a page that people put information on, but feedback and questions on the original content get ignored. It's particularly annoying when the original page ''could'' be construed as some sort of advertising or AwarenessRaising, and one possible result is that people who visit the page and take an interest get annoyed at being ignored.

The page does, of course, mostly likely get read; it's just that the people who put it there originally seem to have treated it as "WriteOnly". This partly harks back to UseNet where people got annoyed by posters saying "Please respond by email as I don't read this group." The standard response was that UseNet is not a WriteOnly medium, and it seems to me that in the same sense neither should be the Wiki. If you put up a page, it should be because you care about the subject and are willing to pay attention to it. Wiki works best as a collaboration, not a MeTalkYouListen environment.
