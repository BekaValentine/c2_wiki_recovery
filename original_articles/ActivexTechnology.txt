'''What is ActiveX'''

A ComComponent that is "Internet enabled", slimmed down from the OLE to support "content push". It was a huge success in the battle to wrestle market share from NetscapeNavigator's plugin architecture.

As a competitor to JavaLanguage, it may have checked the growing demand for Java because ActivexTechnology can be delivered through much cheaper mechanisms such as VbClassic and ActiveXscripting. As the market share of MicrosoftWindows grew, it made business sense for developers to think first of ActivexTechnology, further aided by its ability to deliver superior "user experience". The price was platform independence.

* It has "built-in" licensing mechanism to allow developers of ActivexTechnology to benefit from developing ActiveX products.

'''ActivexSecurity'''

What ActiveX offers, in the form AuthentiCode (DigitalSignature''''''s for components), is not so much ''security'' as ''accountability''. AuthentiCode is designed to make it hard to spoof a component's credentials. This permits you to decide whether to download and run a component based on whether you trust the component's creators. Once you've said "yes", an ActiveX component has no restrictions on what it can do.
