Historically the name 'Parrot' derives from the ParrotLanguage April Fools joke.  
As far as we know, Jimmy Buffet has nothing to do with this... :)

Parrot is released monthly, with longer-time support for every third release.

The source of the virtual machine is available through various channels; see
