	quine:	in computing, a program producing its complete source code as its only output without simply opening the source file of the program and printing the contents (such actions are considered cheating).

This type of program is offered as a somewhat more interesting alternative to HelloWorld programs.

Quines are named after the logician WillardVanOrmanQuine.
----
Why are quines so interesting ?
Because they are "obviously impossible".

* Can you print "Hello, world." ?
* ''Easily.''
  print("Hello, world.")
* So now you know how to print *anything*.
*  ''A few things are a bit tricky, but yes -- anything.''
* Ah, but can you print quotes around it ?
*  ''It's a bit tricky, but not a problem.''
  print("\"Hello, world.\"")
* You've just replaced the problem of the quotes with the problem of the slash.
*  ''No, I can print slashes as well:''
  print("quote: \" slash: \\ another slash: \\ another quote: \" The end.")
* Ah, but I bet you can't print the entire program.
*  ''Sure I can.''
  print("print(\"Hello, world.\")")
* Yes, that prints the hello world program. But ...
* ''Oh, I see what you want.''
  print("print(\"print(\\\"Hello, world.\\\")\")")
* Yes, that prints *a* program. But it doesn't print *itself*.
* ''It's a bit awkward, but I suppose you want this:''
  print("print(\"print(\\\"print(\\\\\\\"Hello, world.\\\\\\\")\\\")\")")
* Yes, that prints *a* program. But it doesn't print *itself*.
...
* Yes, that prints *a* program. But it doesn't print *itself*.
* ''Oh. But that would ... that would require an infinite number of escapes.''
  print(" <some stuff> <infinite number of slashes >"Hello, world.<infinite number of slashes>" <more stuff> ")
* Sorry, my computer doesn't have an infinite amount of memory.
* ''Well then. It's impossible for a finite-size source file to hold another copy of the source file inside itself. A thing cannot be bigger than itself.''
* Obviously.

  FOR I = 1 TO LEN(A$)
  SELECT CASE MID$(A$, I, 1)
  CASE CHR$(39): PRINT CHR$(34);
  CASE CHR$(97): PRINT "A$ = " + CHR$(34);
  CASE CHR$(98): PRINT "FOR I = 1 TO LEN(A$)";
  CASE CHR$(99): PRINT "CHR$(";
  CASE CHR$(100): PRINT
  CASE CHR$(101): PRINT "SELECT CASE MID$(A$, I, 1)";
  CASE CHR$(91): PRINT : PRINT "CASE CHR$(";
  CASE CHR$(93): PRINT "): PRINT";
  CASE CHR$(33): PRINT A$;
  CASE ELSE: PRINT MID$(A$, I, 1);

Possibly the shortest quine of all can be written in the (original, pre-Visual) BASIC language. It reproduces itself whether you list it or run it. Here it is:

  10 LIST
''But this (and any other program) that simply outputs a source code listing should be considered cheating - for a quine to be a true quine, it must surely involve quotation.''

[Yes, this is cheating. The canonical shortest quine using this sort of cheat was in c, with a compiler that would accept an empty file as input and construct an executable that echoed nothing to stdout. I can't recall if this was standard-conforming or just undefined behaviour though...]

Almost all scripting languages allow the 'empty program' cheat. [Yeah, but it is less interesting with an interpreter - and this instance predates most scripting languages.]

[It is questionable whether the 'empty program' approach even counts as cheating. It is cheating for a quine to access its own source code, either via file i/o or via special language functionality like "LIST", but an empty program does no such thing.]

A Befunge quine:

  :0g,:93+`#@_1+
----
'''BourneShell'''
----
A trivial example in Bourne shell:

  #!/bin/sh
  cat $0
but this is really cheating because it is using '''cat''' to read its source code. A real SRP contains a copy of its source code within the code itself.
----
Along the same lines, the one-line script:

  #!/bin/cat
will achieve the same function without running a shell.
----
'' What about my bash quine?''

  b=\' c=\\ a='echo b=$c$b c=$c$c a=$b$a$b; echo $a'
  echo b=$c$b c=$c$c a=$b$a$b; echo $a
-- Tafuni Vito - Italy - vitotafuni_AT_gmail.com
----
Great. Here's a shell quine based on that one, but on one line:

  b=\' c=\\ a='echo -n b=$c$b c=$c$c a=$b$a$b\;; echo $a';echo -n b=$c$b c=$c$c a=$b$a$b\;; echo $a
----
I took Tafuni Vito's BASH quine above and made a fork bomb with it:

  b=\' c=\\ a='yes $( echo b=$c$b c=$c$c a=$b$a$b; echo $a ) | bash &'
  yes $( echo b=$c$b c=$c$c a=$b$a$b; echo $a ) | bash &
It's a lot more heavy-duty than a traditional fork bomb, so don't complain to me if it made your system crash.
----
A Shell "quine":

  z=\' a='z=\\$z a=$z$a$z\; eval echo \$a'; eval echo $a
These should be called "goedels" because the technique occurs in the development of the first incompleteness theorem by Kurt Gödel in 1930 / 31.

  printf(str, 0x22, str, 0x22);}

'''CompilerErrorsAreYourFriends'''
----
Years ago I came across a programming challenge (in a magazine I believe) that asked the competitors to write a QuineProgram.  When the answers were published, the one that I thought was particularly clever went as follows:

*Start with any compiler.
*Write a program that will not compile.
*Take the error report from the compiler and compile it.  This will most likely not compile.
*Take the new error report and compile it.  Repeat until the output matches the input.
*If you consider the compiler as an interpreter (rather than a compiler) you now have a program that produces its source code as it's ouput when ''interpreted'' by the compiler.

-- ChrisHines
----
I tried this approach with GCC. However, I always end up with a cycle of length 2.
Moreover, since GCC reports file names in its error messages, the name of
the file is significant (how unelegant).

  "Let the following text, enclosed in double quotes, be called Text A.

  things down, separated as paragraphs.  (That's just boring copying.
  You needn't be interested in the text you're handling.)  First, all
  of Text A that precedes the three dollar signs.  Second, the whole of

Here's a PhpLanguage QuineProgram by Opanasjuk Yegor (cheat):

 <?php
  $sFile = file_get_contents(__FILE__);
  echo $sFile;
----
Another (cheat) PHP quine:

  <?=file_get_contents(__FILE__);
or alternatively:

  <?readfile(__FILE__);

'''PliLanguage'''
----
The following is (probably) the shortest possible Quine in PL/I. It only compiles with he old V2.3.0 compiler and requires a few non-standard compiler options, COMPILE and MAR(1,90,0) (Source starts in column 1!)

  %dcl z%z=&apos;put edit&apos;;proc options(main;q=&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;put list(m;do i=1,2;z(q)skip;do j=

'''PolyGlot'''
----
Here's the classic Loophole Quine.  In addition to being the shortest ever quine in Python, it is an all-language PolyGlot, and in LazyKayLanguage, it even acts as UNIX cat with no arguments.  Here it is:
  
...That's it.  Nothing.  0 bytes of self-replicating quine.  XD and LOL.
----
"Hello" is a quine in many languages?
----
If you're masochistic, you may want to write a quine that is also a polyglot (see HelloPolyGlots). Here is a quine that works as CeeLanguage, CeePlusPlus, PerlLanguage and PythonLanguage:

  #include <stdio.h>
  #define q(a,...) a
  #define substr q
  #define eval(a) main(){char c[]=a,n=10;c[419]=0;printf(c+4,n,n,n,n,34,34,n,34,39,c+4,39,34,n); }/* Copyright (C) Thomas Schumm <phong@phong.org>
  exec("from sys import*;substr=q=lambda y:exit(stdout.write(y[4:-46]%((10,)*4+(34,34,10,34,39, y[4:-46],39,34,10))))",None);#*/
  eval(substr(q("$p='#include <stdio.h>%c#define q(a,...) a%c#define substr q%c#define eval(a) main() {char c[]=a,n=10;c[419]=0;printf(c+4,n,n,n,n,34,34,n,34,39,c+4,39,34,n); }/* Copyright (C) Thomas Schumm <phong@phong.org>%cexec(%cfrom sys import*;substr=q=lambda y: exit(stdout.write(y[4:-46]%%((10,)*4+(34,34,10,34,39,y[4:-46],39,34,10))))%c,None);# */%ceval(substr(q(%c$p=%c%s%c;printf($p,(10)x4,34,34,10,34,39,$p,39,34,10)%c),1,-1))%c'; printf($p,(10)x4,34,34,10,34,39,$p,39,34,10)"),1,-1))
''When I compiled and ran as C/C++, it didn't work (missing only a few characters)--a change made to gcc?''

''Working fine for me with gcc 3.3.4...''

'''PythonLanguage'''
----
This one is inspired by the below RubyLanguage example
  s = 's = {0!r}; print s.format(s)'; print s.format(s)
----
And here is another
  _="print '_='+chr(34)+_+chr(34)+'; exec(_)'"; exec(_)

'''RexxLanguage'''
----
RexxLanguage has a SOURCELINE command that prints the source of a line of the program (meant for use with error messages), so the following should work as a Quine in REXX (don't have an interpreter to check right now):

 sourceline 1
''That's cheating, though, akin to the bash one above that uses cat $0''

'''RubyLanguage'''
----
Here's one in RubyLanguage

  puts(s = <<e, s, 'e')
  puts(s = <<e, s, 'e')
  e
  
----
And another in RubyLanguage

  s="s=%s;printf s,s.dump";printf s,s.dump
----
'''SchemeLanguage'''
----
For starters, here is the classic Quine in SchemeLanguage:

  ((lambda (x) `(,x ',x)) '(lambda (x) `(,x ',x)))
Using outside-language facilities to access the source is considered cheating. E.g. opening the source as a text file would be cheating. But cheating in original ways is strongly encouraged. ;-)

'''SuperCollider'''
----
Here's one in SuperCollider.

Here's one in SwiftLanguage

In AnarchyGolf the current directory contains only one file, which is the script itself. Which means in Zsh you can do the following two byte cheating quine:

For a lot more see http://www.nyx.net/~gthompso/quine.htm
----
OK I've got to ask: would it be cheating for the program to access its binary image, reverse compile itself, and write the result to stdout?
----
See SelfReplication, MixingLevels, SelfAssembly
----
An old IOCCC entry forever cinched the spot of shortest quine - at one point, gcc would, given the right compiler switches, compile a zero-byte C program into a program that does nothing. Thus, it is a zero-byte program that produces a zero-byte output - a perfect quine!
----
'''An *actual* quine.''' Use Assembly since you have the instruction pointer readily in hand. You can save the instruction pointer, and have the program hard code how many lines it has, then use a loop to print each line of code. The entire program would simply be a way to decompile assembly statements into printable text. This isn't a cheat since assembly is loaded into memory because assembly is loaded into memory as a prerequisite to running the program. -- LeeLouviere

I'd call it cheating for a program to load from the program portion of its allocated space in memory, or any part of the non-writable portion of its memory that doesn't contain data literals.  You can make an assembly quine with these restrictions -- DavidRutter
----
These programs should be named `Gödels' or `Goedels'. The technique which underlies them is to be found in the proof of the first Incompleteness Theorem, and that occurs before Quine's ideas (cf. Kurt Gödel's Collected Works I, p. 175).
