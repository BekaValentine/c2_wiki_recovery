I went to see this movie at the theater with a few friends. One of those friends turned in his resignation letter the next morning. --PierrePhaneuf

I went to see this movie with a gang from work. When Peter comes to work after being hypnotized, they all commented that he had turned into me. -- EricHodges

When I saw this movie, I could name each real person in this movie I work with - scary. -- MichaelSutherland

A CowOrker of mine assures me that if you watch the movies OfficeSpace, FightClub, and AmericanBeauty all in a row, in that order, and you are a strong person, you will have a life-altering epiphany. Otherwise your head will explode. (He has done it, but I've been afraid to make the experiment.) -- CameronSmith

	 :	'''1st Bob:''' What you do at Initech is you take the specifications from the customer and bring them down to the software engineers?
	 :	'''Tom:''' Yes, yes that's right.

	 :	'''2nd Bob:''' Well then I just have to ask why can't the customers take them directly to the software people?

	 :	'''Tom:''' Well, I'll tell you why... because... engineers are not good at dealing with customers...

	 :	'''1st Bob:''' So you physically take the specs from the customer?

	 :	'''Tom:''' Well... No. My secretary does that... or they're faxed.

	 :	'''2nd Bob:''' So then you must physically bring them to the software people?

	 :	'''Tom:''' Well... No. ah sometimes.

	 :	'''1st Bob:''' What would you say you do here?

	 :	'''Tom:''' Look I already told you, I deal with the @#$% customers so the engineers don't have to. I have people skills! I am good at dealing with people, can't you understand that? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

	 :	'''Peter:''' "Hey Lawrence, when you go into work.... does anyone accuse you of having a bad case of the Mondays?"

	 :	'''Bob:''' So, Peter, I see you've been missing a lot of work lately.
