What it sounds like when you read a Wiki discussion by anonymous authors. If you picture the Wiki as a single entity, it's like it's trying to work out a problem in its head with one side being advocate, and the other side devil's advocate. And sometimes it sounds like it's brainstorming different alternatives.

Comment: When I add items to Wiki which are purely factual I do not sign them. e.g. versions of software or adding relevant links. When something is my opinion I give my name. That is why I now have a lot of backlinks. -- JohnFletcher
