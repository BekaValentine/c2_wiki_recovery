And you thought CaptainHornHair was bad? How about:

	* You guys keep working to fix this planet's problems.  I'm off to improve relations with the naked green chicks.
	* I've had superintelligent chicks, alien queens, fembots, real live godesses, even Joan Collins in her prime. But even though we just met you make me feel like I never felt before.
	* Can you design some sort of cloaking device that will hide my bald spot and make my waist look slimmer?
	* Climb up into the JeffriesTube with me, yeoman. No, you first ...
	* Let's form an away team.  Rand, Uhura, Troi, Yar, Ro, Dax, Kira, SevenOfNine, and T'Pol, you're with me.  We can all squeeze into one shuttle.
	* Lieutenant, when stranded on a frozen planet, sharing body heat is a vital survival technique.
	* I know the rest of Starfleet updated the female crew uniform years ago, but on this ship, we honor tradition!
