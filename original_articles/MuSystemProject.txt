The Mu System Project (http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~usystem/) at the UniversityOfWaterloo is concerned with concurrency in programming.

''The project is looking at development of a highly-concurrent shared-memory programming system.''

Specifically, they are developing MuCeePlusPlus (muC++), which is an extension of CeePlusPlus to include high-level object-oriented concurrency for C++.
