BerliOs is an open source evangelization effort by the Europe located 'Fraunhofer Institute', its probably most important service being the SourceForge-derived and -imitating open source ''project hosting service'' http://developer.berlios.de/, which provides:

* code repositories (ConcurrentVersionsSystem and SubVersion)
* file repositories (and anonymous FTP access and considerably less user-frustrating file download interface than SourceForge)
* web server, database (MySql and eventually PostgreSql?)
* bug and patch tracking, mailing lists
* forum, wiki, site-wide project news
* ah, yes, and the shell service, of course (hard quota 5MB)

It is greatly enhanced in comparison to SourceForge and since it currently hosts few less projectes, maintenance is more active (up-to-date servers) and admins are pretty user friendly. Also it is purely non-commercial and sponsored from a non-profit (?) organisation.

Opposed to its TLD, its interface is also available in English (not only German). Some major projects are already hosted there, and transitors are welcome.

It's not clear if they use the original SourceForge code or GeeForge, but they've clearly enhanced what was out there.
