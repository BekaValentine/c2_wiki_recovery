	* The first time you do something, you just do it manually.
	* The second time you do something similar, you wince at the repetition, but you do it anyway.
	* The third time you do something similar, you automate. AutomationIsOurFriend.

'''Examples:'''

	* The process of renaming a class.  When you're using file-based source code and a file-based version control (such as CVS), renaming a single class is an ordeal.  Use something like ReadWriteGrep and some ad-hoc scripts to make renaming a class more enjoyable event. ''(Or use EclipseIde -- or IntelliJ IDEA)''

	* Build dependencies in C++.  You really shouldn't have to recalculate these by hand.  See the suggestions on RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful.

	* ProgrammableDayTrading (and other business automation)

	* construct a GUI test-free, by running it over and over again, frequently by using the debugger

	* Don't forget TabCompletion, just because you use it without thinking.

	* ...

''ThePowerOfNow'' may be useful for justifying automation's costs to the PointyHairedBoss.  Perhaps I should read it?

This violates the ZeroOneInfinityRule. You should automate on the second step because you KNOW you will repeat it.
