Programmer, websurfer, cyclist.  I once had three rules for living:

	1. Drink a beer every day,
	2. Ride a bike every day,
	3. Never watch television.

I up with 1 pretty well, 2 is catch-as-catch-can, and 3 is hopeless.

Got started in the programming game writing a FORTRAN prime-number generator for an IBM 7094 (ReallyOldIron !).  

These days it's keeping PC, server, and mainframe in synch, WorkingOnTheRailRoad.

I know a John Roper in Topeka, KS who works for BNSF.  Are you that John Roper? (from David Hurt, Ft Worth, TX)
