Not sure if there is a page on this wiki that describes this pattern.. but..

An AhaMoment is a "Eureka" feeling you have when you discover something important or enlightening. It's almost euphoric. 

'''Aha! there is a page already.. it's above, found by accident SmashingWordsTogether'''

So this page could be deleted and merged, or it could be kept as the plural of AhaMoment with the "S" on the end.  Not sure what is considered best practice on wiki.
