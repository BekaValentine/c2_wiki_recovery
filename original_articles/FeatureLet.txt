A featurelet is the smallest increment in the construction of a feature, and is a useful concept when dealing with separate testing teams (AgileBridge).

(Back-formation using nominally unproductive suffix "-let", meaning "little" in a few words such as "droplet" or "starlet", and as such it should be expected to require explanation to non-native speakers of English.)

FeatureLet''''''s allow for:

	1 Work to be delivered in smaller units to the tester.
	2 Work to be delivered sooner after it becomes available
	3 Quicker and more timely feedback to the developer

A FeatureLet is usually surrounded by incomplete functionality.  There could be menu items and buttons that open an empty dialog.  The dialog could just be a dummy because the real one has not been implemented yet.  The buttons and menu items would be a featurelet, a small part of the feature.  A tester would want to know about this if it affects any scripts he has written.  A developer could let him know through a DeveloperStory.
