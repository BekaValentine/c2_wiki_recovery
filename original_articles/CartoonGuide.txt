Larry Gonick's Cartoon Guide books use comics to teach everything from physics to economics. To understand why these guides are not just for kids, see UnderstandingComics. The series includes cartoon guides to chemistry, communication (or non-communication), the computer, the environment, genetics, CartoonGuideToPhysics, sex, and statistics; there is also a thirteen-part Cartoon History of the Universe.
