I am a Software Analyst / Developer (contractor) based in Leeds, UK. 

My current (April 2004) interests are the WinForms development in the .NET Framework, TestDrivenDevelopment, ObjectRelationalMapping, UserInterface''''''s and getting my head around OO! 

When not reading or working I enjoy painting, writing songs, and playing guitar and piano. If I'm not doing any of these things then I'm probably in the Pub having a few beers!
