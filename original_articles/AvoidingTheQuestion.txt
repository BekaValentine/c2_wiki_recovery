One of the FallaciousArgument''''''s.  Actually, this one isn't an argument at all--it's the practice of ducking a question that one cannot, or would prefer not, answer.

Ways to avoid the question.  Often these are combined for greater effect.

	* Attack the speaker--ArgumentAdHominem
	* Respond with a question of your own--expecting the speaker to answer ''your'' question before you answer his.
	* Question the legitimacy of the question (sometimes this is legitimate)
	* Use a defense such as "isn't it obvious?" or "Everyone knows that"
	* Attempt to change the subject
	* Provide a non-answer (or a vague generalization that may or may not apply to the particular question--and which if it does, can be denied later).
	* Provide generic references to the literature or some other authority
	* Terminate the discussion ("Sorry, I have to go now...").  Especially popular with talk-show hosts.
	* Answer the question you wish had been asked instead.  The answer should be long enough that the real question is forgotten.  Especially popular with politicians.
