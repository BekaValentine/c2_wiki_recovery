Main product is Internet Selling System. Package of software products provided by SelecticaInc that combine ConstraintBasedConfiguration (in the form of a SelecticaKnowledgeBase) with other components needed for scalable web and detached mobile applications.

Other components include:

	* SelecticaAceEnterpriseServer
	* SelecticaModelBuilder, Java-based application for creating and editing a SelecticaKnowledgeBase.

Their knowledge base is saved in a text file with the .kbs extension. Some people say this file is in xml format. However, people that know about well-formed XML documents just point and laugh.

Edit note: random wandering turned up this little knot of Selectica* pages, I'm pretty sure it's an abandonded old WalledGarden, I've inlined the shallow pages and am content to leave it at that for now.
