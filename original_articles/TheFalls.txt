PeterGreenaway's first film. 4 hour ersatz documentary about 27 people affected by some worldwide unspecified catastrophe. All subjects have names beginning with the letters "F A L L" - Fallsworth and so on.

Some subjects merely develop a compulsion to drive around roundabouts for hours. Others speak in tongues. Two little girls develop a language that no one but themselves understand. Still others develop avian characteristics. Several of the short descriptions given fit subsequent Greenaway films, especially DrowningByNumbers.

TheFalls is difficult for many people to watch, but wonderful for folk who enjoy PhilipGlass music and JorgeLuisBorges books.
