I like RedBar. I like writing code, and RedBar tells me that I need to do it. RedBar even points me at the piece of code I need to write. When I get to GreenBar, I don't know what to do next. I get a coffee and surf the web and life loses all meaning. If I am sufficiently lost, I might even check in. Eventually I figure out what is wrong with my program and write a new test and get back to RedBar. Then I am alive again! -- JohnFarrell

RedBarAddiction Patterns:
* CodeUnitTestFirst - quickly gets you to RedBar
* TriAngulation - when you have GreenBar, write a unit test which will give you RedBar AND as an added benefit, any attempt to fix it quickly will result in existing unit tests giving you RedBar as well.

I have just finished reading Kent's book on TestDrivenDevelopment, as a way of trying to appreciate the truth behind the fervour of a colleague who is a GreenBarAddict. It seems to me that GreenBarAddiction encourages you to not write any tests, and RedBarAddiction encourages you to not write any working code :-). For this reason, I reject GreenBarAddiction, and suggest that there must be a middle path. I don't know what it is yet. -- JF
