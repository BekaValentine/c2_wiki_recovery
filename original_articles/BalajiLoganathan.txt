Hi Balaji,

I am also a Software Analyst who lives in Geneva. I have a number of years experience in Java/Web development for a large Multinational IT company and I have previously worked on a project where we applied the Agile and Extreme Programming (XP) methods very successfully.
I would love to get an opportunity to apply these skills within other projects, especially within an International organization. 
Could you advise how best I could progress with this; either as an employee or independent contractor!

My email is agbusinesssolutions@hotmail.com.
Thanks for the assistance,
Aidan
