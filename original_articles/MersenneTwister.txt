A good general purpose PseudoRandomNumberGenerator.

This is the basic PRNG for PythonLanguage and RubyLanguage, and it or one like it (i.e. fast and with a large period) should be adopted by every language under the sun.

''It is annoying that PythonLanguage and many other implementations, including PerlLanguage, only allow one LongInteger as a seed, even though there are 624 unsigned longs (2496 bits) holding the state of the generator, and the CeeLanguage reference implementation does allow a full seed.''

But in Python the LongInteger can be arbitrarily long... So where's the problem (for Python)?
