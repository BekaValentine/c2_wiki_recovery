WikKe is a 3 line 206 character WikiClone in PHP, JavaScript, and Bash. It 
was written for the ShortestWikiContest by Jim Ley, Sean B. Palmer, and 
Adam Wendt, with help from Charles Goodier, Adam Bregenzer, and Daniel Biddle.

WikKe uses HTTP PUT to submit posts, which both Mozilla and IE support. The main 
version of Wikke is for Mozilla, but we've also made available a version for 
Win32 InternetExplorer, which is actually a little shorter at 199 characters.

Sources: 

	* Wikke: http://thelsdj.org/wikke/wikke.txt (206 chars)
	* Win32 IE version: http://thelsdj.org/wikke/wikke-ie.txt (199 chars)

How to use: 

	* Type your text in the input box.
	* WikiNames are converted automatically to links.
	* HTML is allowed.
	* Unfocus the input box, e.g. by clicking outside of the input box, to upload; refresh the page, e.g. with Ctrl+F5, to view the updated page.
	* Backlinks will be diplayed to the right of the input area for pages which are about to be created.  ''that isn't really backlink support, is it ?''

Working examples: 

	* Wikke (Mozilla etc.): http://jane.no-ip.com/~sbp/wikke/HomePage
	* Wikke (Win32 IE): http://jane.no-ip.com/~sbp/ie/HomePage

To install: 

	* Create a script-writable "wikke" directory.
	* Make sure you have a put handler set up. If you don't, you can use the one at http://thelsdj.org/wikke/put_py.txt
	* Set "ErrorDocument 404 /wikke/wikke.php" in your .htaccess
	* Upload the relevant version of wikke as wikke.php
	* Take care to follow the PHP notes below.

The team effort spanned many hours of discussion, and we noticed a number 
of issues along the way: 

	* In PHP 4.2.0 and later, register_globals must be turned on.
	* Safe mode must be disabled and shell_exec() enabed.
	* JavaScript must be enabled in the web browser

It's a bit of a squeeze, but at least it fits in a sig-block!

Etymology: From Webster's (1913): Wikke \Wik"ke\, a. Wicked. [Obs.] --Chaucer.

Bug reports:
* ''Doesn't work for me at all in MozillaFirebird 0.7 for Linux - I see a page with a text field and some (non-linked!) WikiWord''''''s, but that's it.''   -- That's what an empty page is supposed to look like.  The non-linked WikiWord''''''s are backlinks to the empty homepage.  --NickCleaton ''Oh. Well, nothing happens, no matter what I do, anyway.''
* ''There don't seem to be any BackLink''''''s in the IE version (IE 6.0.2800 winXP)''
* ''In Mozilla 1.1 under FreeBSD it kinda works a bit, but the text area goes empty at each page view so you have to retype the whole page to avoid blatting it at each edit''
* ''Ditto mozilla 1.5 under FreeBSD''
