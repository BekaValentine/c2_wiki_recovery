I've noticed this recently; Company X puts a process in place that limits the ability of engineers to place files on the server. Engineers respond with bizarre work-arounds, such as embedding Java objects in database BLOBs or allowing compiled Java code to be injected via XML messages sent to a backend server. I've seen variations on this in my last couple of positions. Has anyone else noticed this? I'm wondering how widespread it is. --BruceIde
