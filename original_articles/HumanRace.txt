Describe HumanRace here.

Are you asking for the current description or the the perfect description?

Current:  A mass of self centered, egotistical people who view personal profit above family values, if I can't make something off of this deal, I don't want it.  A minority, view life as a challenge, and family and a virtue, but still take the 'what's in it for me' attitude.  Belief in God is good, but you better believe what I believe, or you're wrong.  I'm of a certain 'race', or sex, or sexual orientation, I deserve special privileges.  Love is only a temporary commitment.  Gee, I don't want to get too serious.

''Is that overall attitude common throughout the world?  Mostly I have seen this attitude in citizens of the US.  (Note that I'm a citizen of the US.)''

Ideal:  Everyone, not only works for the betterment of their family, but for the betterment of the community.  People actually work for a living, instead of trying to find ways screw the system.  Men and women of any 'color' are equal, and affirmative action means someone taking a chance to try and make the proper decision on a certain issue.  People take responsibility for their own actions, and don't blame parents, society,  or a situation that hasn't existed for over 100 years for their current problems for their current situation.  And, I don't care how my last lover treated me, I still have the capacity to love and live again.

''I'd rather call it dangerously naive. What do you mean by "betterment of the community"? (AntZ)''
  
The Human Race transcends all boundaries.  There is only one race on this planet, and you better get used to it!
Join the Human Race, or get off our planet!   (markover@earthlink.net)
