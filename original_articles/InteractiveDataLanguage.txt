InteractiveDataLanguage (IDL for short, sometimes confused with the CorbaInterfaceDefinitionLanguage)

An ArrayOrientedLanguage created by DavidStern and commercialized by ResearchSystemsInc.  Excellent for scientific
data-processing.  Similar to MatLab, but with earlier (and better) support for arrays > 2 dimensions.
IDL was also the starting point for the PvWaveLanguage.
