'''Visual Python''' is a PythonLanguage variant developed for physics modeling at Carnegie-Mellon University. It has a 3-dimensional vector space and a lighting model for making scenes. Uses OpenGL and automagically allows scenes to be rotated and zoom-able. Probably one of the nicest additions to the language.

It was nearly included in the Python standard distribution, but was factioned-off when a LanguageWars erupted over FloatingPoint. The scientists wanted floating point division, and the computer scientists wanted integer division.

* For only graphics, or for other purposes?

** It was mostly a cosmetic issue because the language did and does support both. Yet the lack of true floating point being embraced by the syntax was seen as a flaw by the scientist who doesn't want to have to worry about the personal philosophy of the language's creator.

''It perhaps says something about the limitations of the language that it couldn't have supported both.''

Hmmm, hopefully they can merge their efforts. VPython uses the Wx windowing library rather than Qt. (''And Python(x,y) haz WxWidgets, too.;'')
