DWIM - Do What I Mean (Not What I Say)
----
From the JargonFile (via http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=dwim&action=Search):
	 :	DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the ideal computer would have. Back when proofs of program correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about "DWIMC" (Do What I Mean, Correctly). A related term, more often seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The RightThing).
