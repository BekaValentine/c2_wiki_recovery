I'm from an RDBMS background and I'm getting into Python and particularly Zope(ZopeApplicationServer or http://www.zope.org) as a way to provide web access to databases. I've already built web pages to access an Informix database I originally developed about five years ago ( complementing/replacing the Informix 4GL code) and I'm also developing from scratch a traditional music (you may call it Celtic music if you live in the US) database (using Zope and PostgreSQL) to be housed at http://www.tunedb.com.

I'm a freelancer working from my home office in the UK. Contact me at mailto:richard@dcs.co.uk
