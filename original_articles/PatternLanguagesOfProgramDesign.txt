This is the book that came out of the first PLoP (http://hillside.net/conferences/plop). Its name has evolved:

	* Pattern Languages of Programs
	* Pattern Languages of Programming
	* Pattern Languages of Program Design

There are two collectors' editions of this volume. The rarest version bears no editorial attribution on the spine; only a few such books were released by the publisher. A few thousand copies sport a sticker bearing the editors' names. We expect the final production version to bear the editors' names on the spine.
