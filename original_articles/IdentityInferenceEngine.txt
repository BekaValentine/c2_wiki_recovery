This phrase came to mind I'm sure because I heard SimonPeytonJones talking about MetaProgrammingInHaskell in Oxford last week, and the additional challenges for type inferencing in the HaskellLanguage that his new syntax for generative programming brings with it. Then there was this excellent fragment from KathyBracy on WhyClublet yesterday:

	 :	Richard, all you had to do was look up four lines on RecentChanges to see my HomePage had the same computer signature (which I'm sure you saw) to know it was I who wrote the above comment.

As I then clarified, I had not in fact seen the edit to Kathy's HomePage, let alone noticed the IP number on it and looked inside to see that it was Kathy herself - ForSure - who was always, or at least frequently associated with that IP number, the very same that had then also edited WhyClublet and added the paragraph in question. Yet I guess that Kathy's assumption would have been a reasonable one for certain classes of RecentChangesJunkies. Correct?

[''Yes''] -- [helpful answer last touched and perhaps agreed with by 62.64.201.151]

Two reasons to raise this:

	*	I thought the analogy with TypeInferencing might be amusing
	*	There is is a serious issue here about barrier to entry to Wiki or indeed (as in my own case) barrier to re-entry. "My IdentityInferenceEngine clearly isn't as good as yours and it shows. Therefore I do not want to take part at all."

Any thoughts from those more regular that me since the DNS reverse look-up was done away with?
