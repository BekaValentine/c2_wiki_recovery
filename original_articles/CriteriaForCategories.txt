Criteria for categories should be listed here:

* A minimum number of about 10 pages should be required.
* The category itself should be interesting.
** I doubt anybody can agree on this criteria.
* Not too similar to an existing category
** Perhaps consider widening (renaming) the similar one to include the target concept. However, perhaps run it by more WikiZens before preceding.
* The common properties of the pages represented by the category should be
** Interesting,
** New or
** Unusual.

When '''not''' to create a category:

* Pages sharing a common prefix or suffix (in this case a h''''''ttp:findPage like may be listed on a PageGroups page).
* Pages sharing some unimportant or random property.
