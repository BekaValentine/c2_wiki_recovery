JimScarver [1] is my AOL Instant Messenger name

I've known Ward (sort of) for many many years as a researcher in collaborative systems and object design.  We have worked together mostly indirectly through colleges.  His act is first class.

I am very pleased that WikiWiki is still alive and well and I am very happy to be playing with it again.
