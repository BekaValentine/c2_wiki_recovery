If you don't know what a Meme is supposed to be, see first MemesShmemes. If you don't know what a Pattern is supposed to be, see first DesignPatterns.

If we're ever to achieve CulturalT''''''ransformation, rather than just play the same old MilitaryIndustrialGames, we better know something about ideas that can propagate. What are the forces and structures of successful, tried and true memes? Can we have a PatternLanguage of memetics, or do we just have to say MemesShmemes and shrug? Here are a few examples of MemesAsPatterns - memeticists please ammend and fill out:

	* DebtMemePattern
	* EscapeMemePattern
	* EnlightenmentMemePattern
	* SaviorMemePattern
	* ScienceMemePattern

Others?
