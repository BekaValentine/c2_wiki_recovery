I'm a SoftwareEngineer with a BigMegaCorporation (specifically, the OtherEvilEmpire).  I'm a huge advocate of the ToolCommandLanguage and am thankful that I've primarily been working in it for my current and previous job.  I enjoy ExtremeProgramming and have been able to practice it in my current and previous job.  I used to get paid to build WebSite''''''s that involve ContentManagementSystem''''''s and ElectronicCommerce, but now I get paid to build BusinessIntelligence solutions (a fancy buzzword for a ReportingSystem) and a huge DataWarehouse using MySQL.

I have a blog at http://dossy.org/.  I can be reached via email at mailto:dossy@panoptic.com.
