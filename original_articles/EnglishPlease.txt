This site hosts an international community that chooses to write largely in English. Our totally open nature depends on volunteer editors who depend on English. We are pleased to see some introductory pages, such as OneMinuteWiki, translated widely to ease the way for international visitors. We are also willing to accept the occasional page written in German, Spanish, French, Italian or Portuguese so long as a link to http:translate is included at the top. However, such pages are automatically a WalledGarden so we ask for restraint in their production. Finally, we ask that native English speakers write plainly without too many AmericanCulturalAssumption''''''s and be patient with non-native writers. Thank you very much. -- WardCunningham
