Describe TapeDuplicator here.

Actually the original design was a slave recorder for 
8-Track music tapes that ran at 32X normal speed. Now,
cassette tapes are duplicated at 80X directly from d/a 
converted digital audio stored in up to 1GByte DRAM banks. Higher speeds can be used with sound quality 
appropriate for voice.
