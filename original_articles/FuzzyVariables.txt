A fuzzy variable would be an opinion. "warmth" is a matter of opinion as we are most aware of. One person can be "warm" just as another can be "cool" in a room that is one single temperature. the word "fuzzy variable" could be used to describe any adjective when applied to a definite pronoun. a fuzzy variable support linguistic model of data apart from numerical one.

"Warmth" is probably not a good example for fuzzy logic.  A better example might be "Hot" with qualifiers "Very" "[no qualifier]" "Somewhat" and "Not".  

Right?
