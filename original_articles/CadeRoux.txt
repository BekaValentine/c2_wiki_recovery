I am a freelance software development consultant.

I am currently building a data warehouse and data processing system for Capital One Bank.

My main interests are programming practical real-world systems for rapid deployment for maximum business advantage at minimal expenditure.  I have a preference for C-syntax, but currently I am proficient in C, C++, Visual Basic, VBScript, ASP, DHTML, JavaScript, and SQL.  I also occasionally use Perl or whatever else it takes to get a job done.

I like making database-driven web sites using ASP, DHTML and SQL Server databases.
