	WalledPage:	A page that is linked to no other page.

You could try to create a WalledPage by editing the URL http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?''S''''''omePage'', where ''S''''''omePage'' is a WikiWord that is neither an existing page nor one of the WantedPages. However, the new page will be linked to from automatically generated pages such as RecentChanges. So there's no way to make a true WalledPage on the WikiWikiWeb.
