''Ahhhh... that's simple''.

This pattern is the idea that even DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork is too complex... especially the lengthy page title.

AhSimple is the simplest way of saying "simple" on this wiki since it uses a short simple to the point title, allowing simple ''and'' the point of simplicity to remain in the page title, still with the shortest characters.

Usually simplicity leads to a nice sigh of relief.

''Ahhh.. thank goodness this API is simple and easy to use.''

''Ahhh.. I understand what they mean on this page. Ahhh.''

Sometimes, simple thoughts come to us while going to the washroom.

Why can't we do do things the simple way first?

''Because any first year college student can (eventually) make a complex solution, but it takes experience and wisdom to make a simple solution that does the same thing.''
