'''A scary thought'''

I have seen lots of material with "listen to the heart" type of slant. Books like "SoulOfAnOrganization", "TheHeartOfChange", etc.

In descending order of importance
* WikiPeace
* MakeRoomForAllViewpoints
* EgolessWiki
* CommunityProcess
* WelcomeToWikiPleaseBePolite
* LetEveryWordTell

Please use HigherPrinciplesDiscussion for deliberations first, before changing the above list.
