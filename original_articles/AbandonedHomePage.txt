A WikiHomePage that:
	* Hasn't been edited in a long time
	* Does not contain any useful BackLink''''''s
	* Does not contain any useful information other than "Hi, I'm JohnDoe."

Such a page should '''not''' automatically be deleted. The page '''may''' be a candidate for deletion. Upon discovery, add an AreYouThere tag to it to alert the 'owner' and to put it on the ToDo list for the next WikiSpringCleaning.

''A home page that says no more than "gee this really works" isn't really a home page and is a candidate for deletion. However, if there is even just enough information to consider saving it here then I would suggest leaving the page in place. -- WardCunningham on DeleteAbandonedHomePages''

If a page has contact information or a link to a homepage, it's probably best to leave the page, or at least attempt to make contact and giving a fairly long timespan in which to respond.
