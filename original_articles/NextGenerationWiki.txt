We're starting to see some NextGenerationWiki''''''s popping up. BackPack, a new website, seems to be the evolution of a wiki as applied to personal information management.

[The next generation wiki will be akin to Web 3.0, move to a decentralized PeerToPeer model for both security of data and protection against misuse of power, add a VotingModel so that the masses of data start to form an order, and be visualizable.]
