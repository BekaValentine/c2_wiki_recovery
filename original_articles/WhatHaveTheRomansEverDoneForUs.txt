'''Reg:''' They've bled us white, the bastards. They've taken everything we had, not just from us, from our fathers and from our fathers' fathers.

'''Stan:''' And from our fathers' fathers' fathers.

'''Reg:''' Yes.

'''Stan:''' And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers.

'''Reg:''' All right, Stan. Don't labour the point. And what have they ever given us ''in return''? ''(he pauses smugly)''

'''Xerxes:''' The aqueduct?

'''Reg:''' What?

'''Xerxes:''' The aqueduct.

'''Reg:''' Oh yeah, yeah they gave us that. Yeah. That's true.

'''Masked Commando:''' And the sanitation!

'''Stan:''' Oh yes ... sanitation, Reg, you remember what the city used to be like.

'''Reg:''' All right, I'll grant you that the aqueduct and the sanitation are two things that the Romans ''have'' done ...

'''Matthias:''' And the roads ...

'''Reg:''' ''(sharply)'' Well ''yes obviously'' the roads ... the roads go without saying. But apart from the aqueduct, the sanitation and the roads ...

'''Another Masked Commando:''' Irrigation ...

'''Other Masked Voices:''' Medicine ... Education ... Health

'''Reg:''' Yes ... all right, fair enough ...

'''Commando Nearer The Front:''' And the wine ...

'''General Audience:''' Oh yes! True!

'''Francis:''' Yeah. That's something we'd really miss if the Romans left, Reg.

'''Masked Commando At Back:''' Public baths!

'''Stan:''' ''And'' it's safe to walk in the streets at night now.

'''Francis:''' Yes, they certainly know how to keep order ...
''(general nodding)'' ... let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like this. ''(more general murmurs of agreement)''

'''Reg:''' All right ... all right ... but apart from better sanitation and medicine and education and irrigation and public health and roads and a freshwater system and baths and public order ... what ''have'' the Romans done for ''us''?

'''Xerxes:''' Brought peace!

'''Reg:''' ''(very angry, he's not having a good meeting at all)'' What!? Oh ... ''(scornfully)'' Peace, yes ... shut up!
