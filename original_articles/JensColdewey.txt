I'm an independent consultant in Munich, Germany. I specialized an OO business systems, especially in the context of insurances.

From 1992 till the end of 1997 I was a consultant at sd&m in Munich, Germany [1], working
in the ARCUS project at last[2]. This project tried to find patterns for the design of OO business information systems.
(Just have a look at our project server [2] to get details)

I had my first experiences with patterns in fall 1993, when I found the GOF pattern mailing list by chance. I liked the idea and the designs, so I kept on reading. In the beginning
of 1996 I joined our ARCUS project - just as it turned towards patterns - and started to write patterns on my own.

I did my Diploma (roughly relates to a German MSc.) in 1991
at the Technical University of Munich and joined sd&m in 1992. Project experience includes OO design projects and
QA (Scott Adams isn't right! QA may be quite interesting if you do the right things). 

For publications have a look at our former project server [2].

Before and during university I worked as film operator in a
cinema and as a paramedic. And every year I join a summer camp for 'financially challenged' Munich children.

Non-CS interests include literature (I took some lessons 
in German literature during my university), Rock music (whatever it may be), cycling and movies.
