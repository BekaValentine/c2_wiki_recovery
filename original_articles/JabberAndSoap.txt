Web services are young. Let's admit that and get critical about the technology and standards that are being proposed from all fronts.

At the core of SOAP, we have RemoteProcedureCall. But this conclusion is hardle fair. 

SOAP is an InterfaceDefinitionLanguage. But it's not that easy.

SOAP is surrounded by proposals for all kinds of services for AsynchronousCommunication, security, WorkFlow, etc.

Jabber (see JabberProject) is an XML messaging system under consideration for a standard by the IETF.

So the questions are these: 

	* What does Jabber lack for XML messaging? 
	* What of SOAP, WSDL, WS-xxx is needed to augment Jabber?
