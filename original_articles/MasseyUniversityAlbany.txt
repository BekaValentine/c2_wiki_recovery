The Albany campus of MasseyUniversity.  Albany is a suburb of NorthShoreCity, which in turn is part of AucklandCity, part of the GreaterAucklandArea, part of NewZealand, and so forth.  I could go on, but that would quickly get ridiculous.

It's a nice friendly campus with only about 8000 students as of this writing, but it has top-notch facilities.  Mostly.  :)
