BasicWebLib uses a "no copy" OpenSource implementation of SunMicrosystems' disconnected rowset in its DAO layer. What this means to the developer is that performance is built in. 

Sounds interesting, but where can I get it? A quick Google leads to
http://sourceforge.net/projects/basicportal
(Hey, wait, the text on that page claims it is "Project: BaseBeans:". Weird.)
Is that what you're talking about? Or something completely different?
