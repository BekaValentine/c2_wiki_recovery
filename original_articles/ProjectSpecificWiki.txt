Okay. I started a new job, and am now in the process of adapting to a totally new environment (cool place; change is still kinda stressful). 

One of the things we're trying to set up is a local wiki, centered around the codebase here. This is something people have talked about before, and something that I've seen in a few places.

The interesting question: what pages always pop up on project centered wikis, that don't pop up (or have completely different semantics) on a large-scale wiki.
  
For example: InnerLoops. It's not even a page on wiki (until someone clicks on that little question mark). But, if it were, it'd be about the general patterns, or about optimization or about ...

Locally, what I'm aiming for is an actual enumeration of the inner loops and a discussion of their history.

I'm not sure I follow, but wouldn't you then, instead of having just InnerLoops use WhatAreInnerLoops or AboutInnerLoops?
