There's a pervasive subculture within the programming community of developers who prefer to work on their own, with no outside "interference."  These developers see themselves as lone gunmen, for whom working with other developers destroys their ability to get into "TheZone."  Also known as CowboyCoder''''''s.

This is particularly troublesome when attempting the ExtremeProgramming practice of PairProgramming.
