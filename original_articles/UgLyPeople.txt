UgLyPeople try and point people to the UgLy page, telling them ''what is'' and ''what is not'' UgLy. They know, because of their first hand experience with ugliness. 

Many noobs (newbies) try to create single UgLy pages and are quickly disciplined by the UgLyPeople.

This wiki software forces one to create a page that is MixedCase, and is the cause of the UgLy disease. 

Treat the cause, not the symptoms (but that would destroy the original c2 wiki, and we'd become NotaWiki).

What is ugly? ''only they would know''
