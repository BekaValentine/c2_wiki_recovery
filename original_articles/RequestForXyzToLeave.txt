Historical context: '''R''''''equestForR''''''obertA''''''bitbolToLeave''' was started as an informal poll on whether Wikizens believe the community would be better off without him.  Within 5 minutes, Robert had started RequestForXyzToLeave pages for all people voting against him.  The pages, and their associated '''*'''Discussion pages, were deleted to LimitTemptation.

This was the original meta-discussion page, and perhaps should be kept so as to have a record of what has not worked.

Just one thought: Please don't start a page of the RequestForXyzToLeave kind if you have been attacked by "Xyz" or been in a flamewar with him/her - it's probably best if such pages are started by parties which have so far remained neutral (and only as a "means of last resort", of course). -- FalkBruegmann

They are ''only'' required for legal purposes if you are preparing to press charges for harassment or stalking. -- SunirShah
