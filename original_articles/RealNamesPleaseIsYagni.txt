From RealNamesPlease: ''In general, it is observed that people who use online nicknames care less about what they write. The discussion is usually taken more seriously when people do not use nicknames, but use their real names.''

What if we made this rule?  Only stamp a person's home page with "RealNamesPlease" after they demonstrate carelessness or damaging non-seriousness.

	* That's unrealistic. What would you write? "Sorry, your writing has been careless, please switch from your nickname, which you have been using for x months on wiki already, to a real name, unlike all the rest of us" ?!?

''There are a number of reasons for the RealNamesPlease  request: The above quotation is only one of them.''
