David Mitchell is a husband, father, developer, author, and basic geek. He leads development teams at VML. He used to teach DesignPatterns, CategoryXml, and the JavaLanguage. David's favorite way to spend free time is with his wife and three children. When they sleep, he likes reading technical manuals and playing with OO languages, particularly SqueakSmalltalk and JavaScript.

You can reach him with a mailto:david.mitchell@gmail.com

Note that DavidMitchell is not DaveMitchell on this site (though he doesn't care if you call him Dave). DavidMitchell thinks its cool that there is a DaveMitchell who also teaches programming and shares similar interests.
