Dear Wiki Forum users, interested in realizing a WikiWayOfLife,

first of all my thanks to WardCunningham, who has created this wonderful 
friendly environment, where innovative tools, ideas, people, new organizations
have a chance to evolve. My thanks naturally extend to all the authors of
this living document.

It was a great pleasure for me to learn, that this forum is already ecommerce
enabled, and that Ward was fair enough to ask the users, if this was
objectionable. I think, it's only a small direct material compensation, not
proportional to his contributions to the wider community. See AmazonAssociate.

As far as I can see from a peep into the list of ISBN publications, there are
only Offline Books (please correct me, if not). Amazon has certainly 
Online Books too.

How can OnlinePublishing be integrated in the Wiki Forum, such that there is a
motivation for contributors, wishing to level up from part-time Wiki to
full-time Wiki activities?

Authors of text, multimedia and software
	* collaborate in the Wiki forum, helping each other and the forum to evolve; this is (self) help + PR in the best sense.
	* present their work as downloads, external to this forum
	* use some sort of online payment system 
	* grant optionally affiliation marketing to each other, with referrer/sell links in the forum or the homepage of the referrer.
	* make optionally donations to organizations that care for people/environment

Additions, comments, discussion welcome.
