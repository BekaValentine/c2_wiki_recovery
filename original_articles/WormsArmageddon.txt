Tanks on steroids. A turn-based aim-and-fire game featuring worms armed with unusual weapons battling it out in a series of randomly-generated landscapes.

Worms World Party is the sequel. Same basic game, same graphics, same mechanics, but has a few extra options and runs on Windows 2000, which WormsArmageddon does not. (For this reason, I have not given it a separate page.)

Warning: this game is hazardously addictive. Like Tetris, you may end up playing this game in your mind's eye as you drift off to sleep.

Other Worms games are available. Worms 2 is worth a look as it is significantly more customizable than either of the two mentioned here. (It runs on Windows 2000.) This poster recommends one of the two mentioned here, however, as they run in higher resolutions (improving the game greatly) and it seems the missing customization does not detract much from the game. -- TomSeddon
