''Delivering amassed knowledge is difficult at best and is more dependent on community than technology.'' 

This is not mainly because people are reluctant to use technology, rather it is because we often need to share knowledge that is neither obvious nor easy to document. Much of our knowledge requires a human relationship or spontaneous interaction to share, be understood, and appropriately applied. While information technology has inspired and fueled the "knowledge revolution," it takes building human communities to realize it.
