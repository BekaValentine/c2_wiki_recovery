'''Build and run a HelloWorld program in Java'''

Writing a Java program is simple enough:

 /* Hello''''''World.java */
 public class Hello''''''World {
   public static void main(String[] args)  {
   System.out.println("Hello world!");
   }
 }

Build the program by typing this at the command line:

 D:\>javac Hello''''''World.java

(Java SDK must be installed on your machine, and the Java binaries must be in your system path)
 
Run the program by typing:

 D:\>java -classpath . Hello''''''World

The output will be:

 Hello world!

Notice that the argument to the interpreter is the name (case sensitive) of the class that contains a main() method.
