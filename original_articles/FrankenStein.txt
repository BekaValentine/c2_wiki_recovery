''Frankenstein, or the New Prometheus'', Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, 1818. [ISBN 0451527712]

Early Science Fiction and Horror book about a doctor who joins different parts of corpses to recreate life. One should not take this description as is, since the book is a classic and touches on different important matters, such as the results of man trying to imitate God.

Frankenstein was written by Mary Shelley as a bet about writing the most frightening ghost story. The bet took place at the house of LordByron and with her lover and future husband Percy Shelley. Mary Shelley won.
