The logic inside the brain of a loser that makes him fail all the time.

If he didn't fail all the time, he would not be a loser, just a normal person who succeeds and fails from time to time.

Also a normal person may have LoserMentality from time to time.

As an example see: AnAcceptableWayOfFailing.
