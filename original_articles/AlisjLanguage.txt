I wanted to make it strange, but also useful in some way.  There are
* a CellularAutomaton operator (which can be used to emulate the InterCal unary operators)
* a computed ComeFrom command
* a stack
* many storage types (function, en-soi, pour-soi)
* 3 different kinds of function calls
** (which all call the same kinds of functions) 
* execution call
* more than 1 command can be executed at the same time
** (if a ComeFrom command is coming from more then 1 command at the same time, then it doesn't come from)
* not numbers but only sequences of bits (which can be used as numbers)
* order of commands typed into the program has nothing to do with what order they are executed
* the order they are typed in only has to do with there priority
** (in case more then 1 tries to execute at the same time)
* and the only conditional command is conditional stop
** (which returns to whatever called it). 

See the examples for more examples, please.

* Is "Alisj" someone's name? What does it mean (in which language)? ''I typed a few leters at random and this is wat it made.''
