Feeling slow? Don't have time for that coffee to perk? Try these for that jump-start:

They go great in cola-flavored JoltCola, or on the side with WaterJoe. The CaffeineRush will get you moving, but you probably won't go anywhere.

They're ScaryFast: they give you the same kind of rush as a strong ShortBlack, but it seems like the caffeine is more easily absorbed.

See also PenguinMince.

Is this WikiSpam? Here comes another arms race! -- PhlIp

I put that there because I thought the folks here would find it funny. They're penguins (think Linux). They're caffeine. They're about the funniest way to head yourself into the non-productive caffeine daze you think is necessary before you begin to glimpse DeveloperMaturity. -- JasonRiedy

Another vote for the original link (restored above). I've always wondered where I could order these. Interestingly enough, the website does not mention the Linux/Penguin connection. -- CliffordAdams (drinker of the OneTrueBeverage)

Is the URL for the product site ''really'' off-topic on a page about the product? There are many other examples on Wiki (like VisualAge, PalmPilot, MicrosoftCorporation, etc.). Some people have questioned the AmazonAssociate links. There is a possibility of abuse, but it seems that debates over advertising are more disruptive than the occasional borderline topic. -- CliffordAdams

''Misty-eyed DeveloperImmaturity reverie:'' The first Spam I ever got was for caffeinated candy. -- PhlIp

...You were compelled to click on PenguinMints? You were expecting something else?

I wish I could discuss the first spam I received in polite company. ;) And I didn't realize you could order them on-line, or else I would have hesitated to post the URL myself. I just get them locally. However, it is really nice to see that other people have sworn off all-nighters. People think me less-than-dedicated around here, as I'm still in grad school and refuse to pull them... Oh, and it'd be nice to see someone else as a book associate rather than Amazon. The movement to BoycottAmazon could use some help. -- JasonRiedy

"BoycottAmazon"?? How about BoycottPaper?! I dunno where TimeMagazine gets off naming Man of the Year the founder of a Web site dedicated to Dead Tree Format and named after our fastest shrinking rain forest. WTF? -- PhlIp
