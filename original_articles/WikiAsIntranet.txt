WikiWiki seems to be ideal for corporate Intranets...  What are your experiences?  If you had similar experiences, edit the page and add your vote.

Add here:

	1 '''no simple layout''': Before trying it, they wanted to make sure that wikis allow background images, a fancy navigation bar, and an editable product list in a side bar.
	1 '''oops, wrong culture''': The organisational culture needs to be one of information sharing.  In an XP environment I am sure a wiki would thrive, elsewhere it may starve.  My experience was that people tried it once but it did not change the way they work.  I now use a personal wiki.
	1 '''the hundredth monkey''': In my experience, (not XP environment) the use rose exponentially when there was enough contributions and contributors.

Wiki as part of the intranet. Works here. Infected the R&D dept, then the IT dept.

I would imagine that corporate wikis would work best in smaller environments. Does anyone have any experience with a large organization like a University or government?

What about recursive links and InfiniteLinking capabilities?
