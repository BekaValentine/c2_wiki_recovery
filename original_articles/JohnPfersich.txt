Describe JohnPfersich here.

Not too much to describe. 
* I've been programming since the early seventies. 
* Said to be a ranting old fool by some of his co-workers.

I use Smalltalk frequently. I use VisualWorks and Squeak quite regularly (multiple times in a week). Been a smalltalker since the eighties. It's still the best language to use, IMHO. I just wish I could work professionally on more Smalltalk projects. A percentage approaching 100 sounds good to me.

''What do you rant about mostly?'' JohannesGijsbers

How to do Software Engineering. Most of the people that I work with know how to program at least fairly well, but most of them do not know the first thing about engineering software. 

(Well, I got a programmer that was a definite exception to the [know how to program at least fairly well] attribute. He had developed an object in Java called MiscFunctions. I guess one should never expect much from a VB scripter.)

The basics are:
* Having a design to code against.
* Doing more than cursory testing.
* Documenting the work.

The worse part is that trying to teach them software engineering is like pulling teeth from an alligator. They don't want to change.

P.S. I'll have to expand upon this subject in the future.
