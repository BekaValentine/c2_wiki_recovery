''When working with HyperLink''''''edDocuments, how we think of words and definitions is changed from the usual sense associated with the words making up the HyperLink''''''Word.'' DonaldNoyes.ThinkingOutLoud.20121203

It is important to think of the word used as a hyperlink as a "ContextualArtifact", a representation of what the link contains, and serve initially as words indicating what is contained at the point location. 

A H''''''yperlinkWord may not be counted on to carry the "full sense and meaning" of the linked document. They are merely tags or tokens for something more extensive and descriptive. When considering the creation of a new document, we should exercise a degree of caution that the words we use as its title and LinkingWord are initially a reasonably good indicator of the content, but we should not be obsessed about it.
