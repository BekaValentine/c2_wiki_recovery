To me, being a software engineer means using the right tool for the job. This means knowing lots of languages, techniques, and methodologies. A carpenter doesn't always use all the tools in his toolbox, rather he uses the ones the job demands. And while he may be masterful at but a few, he is necessarily proficient at many.

I have recently been introduced to FoxPro, and I am soaking it in. It's a great platform, and I love how highly specialized the language is, specifically how SQL is built in. I'm so sick of cating together strings in VBA. The closest I've seen in language specialization is AllaireColdFusion, which is a great web application platform, but built on the client/server model, which isn't always what you need.
