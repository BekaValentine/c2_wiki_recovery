A simple Java LayoutManager. All components (widgets) managed by such a LayoutManager are placed in cells in a grid. Each and every cell in the grid has the same size. Such a layout manager is useful for regular widget layouts, e.g. for laying out buttons to form some kind of numeric keypad when implementing a calculator. A much more powerful LayoutManager is GridBagLayout. The two names are sometimes confused. However, GridBagLayout works completely different.
