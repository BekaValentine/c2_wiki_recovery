I purchased my first NeXT, a NeXTdimension, in 1991 while still working for the EvilEmpire.  About six months later I quit, having never owned an IBM PC-clone.  I have worked almost exclusively in ObjectiveCee since that time, having worked with CeePlusPlus and Java merely for the experience with other O-O-ish language options.

Java is nice.  It solves a few of the problems with ObjectiveCee - namespaces and abstract classes/methods - but introduces a new set of problems and loses some of the powerful features of ObjectiveCee.  I find that implementing the same design in Java requires more lines of code than in ObjectiveCee.  Also, the strong typing of Java forces the developer to use casting, which basically means that you won't know until you execute the code under all possible conditions whether there will be a class exception.  Java suffers in the area of polymorphism and dynamism in this respect.
