Goto BLAS is an implementation of the BasicLinearAlgebraSubprograms (BLAS) which can be installed optimised for different hardware. It takes advantage of multicore CPUs by running multiple threads in a single threaded main program.

GotoBLAS2 was released by the Texas Advanced Computing Center as open source software under the BSD license. 

This product is no longer under active development by TACC, but it is available to the community to use, study, and extend. It is available from the Texas Advanced Computing Center at

GotoBlas is set up to detect the particular CPU and modify itself to do the best on that hardware. Unfortunately, the version for the Intel I7 CPU, Nehalem, was under development when development stopped, and has bugs. The safe option is to define the CPU as CORE2 instead. This is not as fast but has the advantage that it works. -- JohnFletcher

There is a new project called OpenBlas which is taking over from GotoBlas.
