''From: AnOoMagicBullet, people "using OO as a kind of CargoCult. (PeterMerel)"''

Thanks, Peter.  I never really understood CargoCult, or why people put such blind faith in either objects or XP or ..., until you wrote that sentence.  Then it hit - we really do have a CargoCult in our business culture... just wait for the right XXX, and the cargo will start flowing in.  For me that explains the impatience with craftsmanship and the steady jumping from new idea to new idea, disappointment inevitably following.  I'll find a way to put this notion to good use, I'm sure.  thanks -- AlistairCockburn
