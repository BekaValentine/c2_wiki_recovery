A term I coined after visiting (WikiStalking) dozens of the pages I found in the BackLink''''''s of a friend of mine, and left small comments on a few of them in response to comments he had made. I didn't have the term in mind at the time but afterwards, when I tried to name what I was doing, the term suggested itself. -- PeterHansen

Presumably, this sort of behaviour could start to feel pretty creepy if you did it to someone you didn't know. It probably already happens a little with "famous" types like, say, RonJeffries, or WardCunningham, or AlistairCockburn. (Not that I mean to send any potential stalkers their way by putting their names here or anything! :-)

But, is it better to be stalked than to simply have all your entries in a Wiki ignored? In the latter case, the implied criticism can be quite severe (nothing I have said is worth commenting on). -- SteveHolden (''who really isn't stalking PeterHansen'' ;-)

Oh, no, I just realized it's now only a matter of time before the StalkBot arrives. -- SH
