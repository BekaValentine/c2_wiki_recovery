'''tiny fonts bug'''

When I use Cygwin's X-Windows, I get super-tiny fonts. This is a FAQ on the Cygwin forums, and the answers give the standard run-around. I don't want to change one font for one program.

I want to change the definition of an inch, so all my programs simultaneously correctly interpret their fonts' point size commands as large fonts. The equivalent for MsWindows is the Display Properties -> font size combo box.

How?
