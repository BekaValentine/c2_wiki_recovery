PairDeveloping is the generalization of PairProgramming to develop arbitrary Objects and Processes, starting with pairs of developers (could include AI agents too :-).

The term is motivated by applying it to ExtremeOpenBusiness.

''("Where two are forming an initial friendly and creative pair, I am with you.") -- quoted from the bible in developer-friendly terms. :-)''
