'''Example in progress'''

Which WorldGeniuses would you choose to go on holiday with?

	* [yynonnnyyooynnyyo] y:7 n:6 o:4 TheFirstKnotMaker
	* [nyyynyyyoynyo] y:8 n:3 o:2 JethroTull
	* [yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy] y:17 n:0 o:0 Dionysus, inventor of wine
	* [nnnnnynooynnnnnynn] y:3 n:13 o:2 JohnStuartMill

I'll bet Dionysus was grumpy and annoyed that it took so long to get wine accepted as a legitimate beverage compared to backyard still beverages. Not a fun guy to be with, in that case. Don't confuse the inventor with the invention.

''You obviously never read EddieCampbell's "BacChus". Dionysus may be older and grumpier, but he's still more fun than anyone else on the list.''

These questions seem odd. Multiple choice with four tristate answers?!

'''Adding questions'''

''What's the ettiquette on appending a question after votes have been placed?  I imagine that within reason, some folk will return and fill in their missing vote.''

''Maybe it would be useful to put [??????y] for your ''yes'' vote on the new question, to  indicate the missing ones?''

It is usually appropriate to add questions only when simultaneously self-searching. In such cases, the insertion of the missing question marks is considered not only good manners but the only way to uphold the high integrity of the WikiBallotBox.
