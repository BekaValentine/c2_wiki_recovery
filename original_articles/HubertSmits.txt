''Personal''

My name is Hubert, I am a Dutchman working in, living in and enjoying Scotland. Married, two kiddiewinks and a dog. I can be found regularly in the radio shack, either with soldering iron or radio in hand. If you like to know more about me then look at my blog: http://hubert.blogs.com

''Business''

I work as a project manager for VisionWare, implementing the company's products at client sites troughout the UK. 

''Agile''

My broad interest in Agile subjects is shown through the following activities: 

* I'm a Certified Scrum Master, practicing this art in my current employment, and participating in various newsgroups to learn and support others.
* I am program director for the Agile Alliance Roadmap program, have a look at http://www.agilealliance.com/programs/roadmaps/Roadmap/index.htm
* I founded the Agile Scotland group (http://www.agilescotland.com/), a group of people with interests in Agile Methods. We're meeting once a month, and have animated discussions on anything agile. Thus far I managed to attract speakers like Ken Schwaber, Mary Poppendieck and Barry Boehm (amongst others). 
* I regularly organise agile training sessions: In 2003 KenSchwaber provided his Certified Scrum Master class in Edinburgh. In 2004 MaryPoppendieck ran her Lean Software Development course in Glasgow.  
* I lecture at Glasgow Caledonian University, a cycle on Agile Development Methods.
* My current activity focusses on Agile2005, assisting MikeCohn in the organisation of one of the tracks. 
* Low priority activities are around the creation of a catalog of Scrum simulations (together with JeanTabaka).
