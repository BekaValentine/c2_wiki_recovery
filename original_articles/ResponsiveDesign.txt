''Automation in WebPage sizing ''
----
Responsive design simply means that a web layout adjusts
* To the size of a device’s browser window including the screen resolution
* So no matter if a user is viewing your page on a desktop, laptop, iPad, smart phone or TV, your important information is sized to the screen in a readable form 
* Using a “media query” to detect the height, width and resolution of the user’s browser and then adjusts the layout accordingly through the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
* Properties such as display width, page orientation, pixel resolution and other device features determine a style sheet which is designed to present the page for its user
