In our workshops we use a lot of games and IceBreakers. They are a great help, not only to make workshops livelier, they often help surface common concerns, and hidden agendas as shown at http://nymn.com

This seems as a good a place as any to share these techniques and maybe to catalogue them.

BruceAnderson started ListsOfGames in response to a question by JimCoplien a long time ago.
