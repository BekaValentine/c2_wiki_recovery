A somewhat obscure (in the US) programming language that shared many features with other better known languages such as PascalLanguage, BasicLanguage and even LogoLanguage.

The CommodoreSixtyFour version of Comal had a built-in Logo emulator, Sprite Graphics, line numbers, Pascal-like structure, and really good sound support. Here is a link to more information about Comal:

(Searching for Comal at Google will also produce FAQs and links to implementations.)
