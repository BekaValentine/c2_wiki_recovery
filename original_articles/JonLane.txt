So here it is my first Wiki page. 

Not sure what to do with it now, but for starters here is a puzzle:

'''Puzzle1'''
Mary is twice the age that Ann was when Mary was as old as Ann is now. Mary is 24, how old is Ann?

If you want to suggest an answer, or would be interested in seeing more puzzles here, please let me know under the comments line below:

''To the person who initially replaced this page with DeletedButWelcomeToWiki, I'm not sure that's appropriate for a HomePage.  It's entirely possible, after all, that JonLane is interested in PeopleProjectsAndPatterns in SoftwareDevelopment.''
