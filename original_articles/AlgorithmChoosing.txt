Here are some questions that are trivial to many of us:
* When is a quicksort better than a heapsort? 
* When should I use garbage collection techniques over explicit programmer controlled memory management.
* What type of garbage collection should I implement? 
* What can I use associative arrays for? 

Choosing the correct algorithm is critical to the performance of software. A decent PatternLanguage for this would make a wonderful supplement to standard texts on algorithms and data structures.
