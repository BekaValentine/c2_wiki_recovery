It's nice to have your trash cans emptied for you.

But it's also nice not to have last afternoon's CrcSession put into a nice stack of cards, or to have your byzantine pile of highly organized chaos reshuffled. (Or to find out your water bottle has been used to feed the plants...)

''Or to find out that the postman put a parcel in the dustbin on the day it was emptied...''
