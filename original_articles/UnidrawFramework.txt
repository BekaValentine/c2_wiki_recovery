Unidraw [1] is a CeePlusPlus application framework for developing custom graphical editors.
JohnVlissides implemented on top of InterViews as part of his thesiswork at Stanford.  It has been mined by a number of application programmers over the years to build a variety of stuff [2], as well as being mined by JohnVlissides for several publications and articles on DesignPatterns.  
For a fairly in-depth description, see [3].

HotDraw is similar in intent but much smaller in scope.

The Berlin Project (http://www.berlin-consortium.org) is working on a Unidraw-like FactoryMethod object.

UnidrawFramework is closely related to the TooledComposite DesignPattern, also by JohnVlissides.
