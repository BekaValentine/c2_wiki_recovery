CircleOfIron is a wonderful movie of SelfDiscovery and a QuestForTruth (slightly different than SearchForTruth..). Co-written by, and originally intended to star BruceLee, but, he died before it was filmed. The wise sage martial arts master character was played by DavidCarradine of KungFu fame. I was inspired to make a combination flute/staff by the one DavidCarradine carries. Okay, it's a little campy, but, you won't regret seeing it. -- RonJandrasi
