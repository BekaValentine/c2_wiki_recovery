# c2 wiki recovery

This is a recovery of the C2 Wiki, currently located at https://wiki.c2.com.

Unfortunately, around 2014 or 2015, the original site was "redesigned" to be a single page app, and now is hard to use, especially on mobile. No static version of the side is available to anyone. Fortunately, a kind netizen, imode, has provided the world with an archive of all of the original WikiText source located at http://imode.gitlab.io/projects/c2/index.html.

I've taken their archive and written a processor to convert the WikiText into HTML. The processor is not guaranteed to be perfect, because WikiText is Bad, but it's good enough to be usable.
